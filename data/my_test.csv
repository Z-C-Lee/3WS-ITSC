"Stopped in at the Mirror Mirror salon and had an amazing experience with Ciara! I got a gel manicure and she was extremely efficient, and great to talk to. Ciara really took her time and made sure my nails were perfect and made sure I liked them too, and I do, I absolutely love my nails. Not only was she amazing, but the entire staff was friendly and personable! I can't wait to go back again!",1
The hospitality is amazing - add to it the great quality of food and the late night options makes it an all-time favorite Indian restaurant for me.,1
"I never liked steak.  No matter how you tenderized it or prepared it, the gristle was too much for me.  Then I bought filet mignon from Branded Meats - their mid-range product.  I asked for six-ounce filets - it wasn't just sitting there hoping I would buy it like in a grocery store...no, it was carved after I ordered it, fat removed save the tiniest bit of marble.  Heaven. on. the. grill.Just brushed some olive oil on it and salt and peppered it.  Melt-in-your-mouth wonderful and made me a steak believer.But only Branded Meats steak.",1
"Gave this eatery a try based on the reviews and menu.  Come hungry as everything on  the menu is appealing.  Enjoyed the booth seating and the quiet as there is ample seating from the coffee bar to the private meeting room and out to inviting outdoor tables with misters on and umbrellas up.  The avocado toast and savory crepe were delicious and filling.  A shout out to our attentive and hospitable server, Mandy.  Looking forward to returning to try other menu items!",1
"Coworker recommended this place. All I can say is thank you! This place is amazing. In the west valley there isn't many restaurants to go but I'm going to add this to a must go place. The food is delicious, the restaurant is beautiful and colorful, and customer service is great. What more can you ask for? You should try it out. You won't be disappointed.",1
I came in to see Sarah today for dysport and she was amazing! Everyone at suddenly slimmer is so friendly and Sarah is very thorough when going over your treatment. I highly recommend Sarah!,1
"I was lead here by the gigantic billboard on Main and Charleston because I was looking for Carpet Barn, which is no longer in business. I needed a large gray 10 ft X 14 ft area rug, which is a size that does not exist in pre made rugs. In order to save money, I wanted to see the remnants carpet only. I had several grays to choose from in various sizes and piles, so that was a good thing! When it was all said and done I paid $374 for the carpet, binding and sales tax. I went in on a Thursday and Jaime was my sales rep. It was very hard for me to understand his thick accent so I may have miss understood him about the details of when my carpet was going to be ready. Because I have a very small car, the only day I could pick it up was on a Saturday when I could borrow someone else's car. Saturday came and they said the carpet was not going to be ready until Monday. After throwing a fit, they said it would be ready in an hour!In the end I got the size, color, price and delivery date that I wanted, I win!",1
"These people are the nicest and most kind business people.   They have been around since 1952 and still care about their customers and provide outstanding service to their customers needs.  Please when in need of new frames, experience the service you do not find anymore anywhere, let alone Las Vegas.  They deserve there success. OUTSTANDING.",1
Went to local Home Depot on Val Vista. Several people asked if we needed help. RD approached us in the lighting and fan section and asked us what we were looking for. He helped us in the fan department and explained about CFM's. We bought two fans today and could not be happier with our experience at your store. RD was awesome. He was very helpful and knowledgeable.,1
"My glasses were broken, the clear line holding the lens in the frame had broken.  I brought them in for an evaluation at 4:30pm.  The technician said the glasses could be repaired, and she could finish before they close at 5:30pm!  Approximately 20 minutes later I was wearing the repaired glasses, looked and felt good as new!Frame Fixer is  my ""go to"" local place for eyeglass repair.  Highly recommended!  Reasonable prices. They treat you right, and understand the importance of your eyewear.  Thanks!",1
I never liked Pho until my boyfriend had me try Pho Avina's Chicken Soup (#21).I officially fell in love with it!,1
"If you are going to go to Crown and Anchor MAKE SURE it's on graveyard Monday thru Friday! Troy is the BEST BARTENDER!!! He is  fast, funny and made us feel like we were the only people there, even though he was busy! He told great bar stories and made excellent food and drink recommendations! Thanks Troy!",1
"Heard about St. Francis from a friend and have been meaning to try it for a while now. We finally made it out and weren't disappointed. It's one of our new favorites. (Honestly every restaurant that has any sort of association to the LGO group turns out to be great in our experience, so we weren't surprised)Decor is modern, atmosphere is great. We were there on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. They only take reservations for large parties so we had about a 30 min wait which we spent drinking on the outside patio. They have a bar along the front of the restaurant that opens up to both the restaurant inside and the patio outside, which is a really nice touch and adds to the atmosphere.The food is upscale comfort food I guess? We started with the baked goat cheese app. It was flavorful and the pesto was such a good touch. The toasted bread was a little hard imo.For dinner we had a bottle of the malbec which was outstanding. Both my wife and I thought it was one of the best $35 bottles (restaurant price obv) that we've ever had. We shared the burger and the pork chop. The burger was a perfect medium rare which made me happy. The pork chop was great and the polenta had a hint of horseradish. I couldn't have been happier. There wasn't any part of the meal we didn't think was perfect.Oh, and for dessert have the sticky pudding. It's out of this world.Overall it was a perfect night. Plus we felt like the prices were really reasonable. One caveat, as some others have said, it's a hopping place and is pretty loud inside. We love that, but we were commenting while there how our parents probably wouldn't like dining there because it's not a quiet relaxing place..We'll definitely be back though :)",1
"This place is absolutely phenomenal!! The service is outstanding. We received constant attention, service and hospitality every second of our dinner. The staff was so respectful and welcoming. Our server in particular, Kealoha, was extremely knowledgeable and professional. Such a great place and atmosphere, can't wait to come back!Thank you again for the awesome service!",1
I came across this quaint tea shop when I was out for a walk with a friend. The tea was delish and my friend and I will definitely come back! So glad I came here! This place is better in comparison to other tea shops out there.,1
"All My Java Divas and DoesThis is the cutest, quaintest cabin feel.  The food and drinks  especially the coffee is a must try.!!!!  You won't be sorry in fact you will be impressed.  The cabin feel here in the Desert  makes for a unique experience.  Wi-Fi available so all you college students get on in there!!! What are you waiting for.  Great place to hold book club, one on one meeting, any type of bible study group.  If your tired of big corporate place you have to try the unique family owned business:)  The prices very affordable.  warded Analynn's  :)",1
"Becky and I love going to the Distill, the food is always good. All the servers are great, but after hanging out for around six months, our server Kelye ask if we had a Red Card. We didn't know, so she explained, and after she receiving one, we got $10 off our next visit. This is our new hangout, keep up the good work.Ken & Becky",1
"We were in Vegas on vacation and had a Groupon deal for a beverage, salad and entrée. After reading others reviews, I thought this was going to be a subpar experience. I was very happy to say it was a great experience. I would definitely go back and pay full price. Service was excellent. We were late for our reservation because of traffic on the strip on a weekend night. But they were very accommodating. The waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and all of her recommendations were spot on for beverages and entrées for all 4 of us. We started with the sampler while we enjoyed our beverages. Several of us had more than one beverage since they were so good. Im allergic to shellfish so I debated between skirt steak and salmon. The waitress recommend the salmon because the skirt steak is chewy sometimes. So I went with the salmon that was served with rice and Bok choy and it was awesome! Everyone else ordered a seafood dish that they were very happy with. With the size portion I was able to have leftovers for two more meals. My husband also had leftovers from his meal that lasted 2 days. Overall it was a great start to a birthday celebration week for our son-in-law.  We will definitely go back next year when we go back to Vegas.",1
"I have had both Glen and John come out to my house to treat my weeds and termites. They come out quickly, and are both really helpful and friendly. I found them both to be very knowledgeable and extremely reasonable. I have recommended them to friends and I would continue to do so.",1
"Dave & TIP are my two favorite bartenders since I go here late night!! Food is amazing, but only when Francis is the cook at night lol I've had bad experiences other wise lol I get the shrimp Alfredo, chicken mac n cheese or steak nachos...all my fav!",1
Wow this was great. Ken gave it to me straight and it's the first time since I've been shopping around for a vehicle that someone has been honest. He had my best interest in mind and big his. He showed me respect and trust. I'll definitely be back to buy from here when I get all my ducks in a row. Thanks ken for being a true car person. Can't wait to come back and buy.,1
"This is an office you can trust. Everyone is a pro.I have had cataract surgery, etc. Everything is smooth, efficient, and friendly.",1
Always bring the fam here when in town. Pierogi pizza! Great seasonal brews too.,1
"By far the BEST nail salon I've ever been to! Quality work, classy environment, and super friendly staff! It's rare to find a salon where every single employee does great work, but I have had many technicians including Tammy, and Apple, and they all have been fantastic! I would drive 100 miles out of the way to come here. So worth it!",1
"You cannot come to this place without getting Pho!  My boyfriend always gets #14 with the rare steak and I get #20, the plain pho and add fried tofu.  As for meat, I highly recommend #37 or #38 (depending on whether you like beef or steak).  This meat has an amazing flamed grilled flavor.",1
"Love this park! There are so many different areas to explore.I absolutely love the running/walking trails. My favorite is the 1.5 mile loop trail around the desert dunes. They really did a nice job with informative signs and info about the dunes. My only complaint is that there is only one area on the trail that has shade. Very well maintained.A large portion of the park is undergoing renovations. so a lot of the park areas are roped off. Hopefully they will be done soon.This park has something for everyone. Fishing, disc golf, basketball, volleyball, tennis, playgrounds, and numerous picnic tables and pavilions. This place also has the largest dog park in Las Vegas. This place is also not overrun by the homeless and has a police station on premises. A great place to bring the family and enjoy a nice day in the park!",1
Two days later was contacted by manager Mike G. He apologized for the oversight on my tire rotation and invited me back in anytime to have the tires rotated. I took him up on his offer and went back without an appointment on Saturday. Mike took me right away and had the wheels rotated asap. He did the right thing and I was on my way in under 20 minutes. Mike's professionalism and excellent customer service follow up has warranted this updated review. All businesses have things fall through the cracks now and then or have an off day once in a blue moon.  It's how they rectify the situation to keep satisfied customers that makes all the difference. Thanks again!,1
"I love Zerores. I use them about once a year. They always clean the high traffic areas nicely. I have 4 dogs so it is important for me not to have the chemicals in the carpet since one dog has seizures. Yes, the tech asked me if I wanted the pet cleaner. I said no thanks and he explains their process. Luis was very nice and showed me the difference in clean. He offered booties but we chose not to take them. He cleaned up and was very professional.",1
"Lilly just changed the battery on my 2011 RAV4   She also used the machine to test my alternator.  Super friendly, professional and helpful.  I'll for sure be back to this location.  Thank you!",1
"On our trip to Vegas, we were looking for a local place to eat breakfast and found this place on yelp. It's in a strip mall and not fancy but homey. The breakfast cooked fresh and the portions are big. The service was excellent. If you are looking for a place to eat good breakfast off the strip, this is the place.",1
Awesome Italian Food! Moving from NJ I know some good Italian food . This place is the best I've had in Vegas. Great old Vegas atmosphere with live music every time I've ever been.The service was great also! Highly recommend Casa Di Amore :),1
"Two words: eggplant meatballs. That's it. I mean, if you enjoy a good cocktail then this joint will not disappoint either. I personally don't eat meat so all I can attest to regarding the ribs are how massive they look. In fact, all the portions are fairly large which is far from a complaint. Oh! Definitely get the cauliflower as well.",1
"Talk about a nice dining experience, this was just beyond words. I loved my entire visit here. I give all components of this review 5 stars: Atmosphere, Location, Service, Presentation, and Product! I visit Ruth's Chris when I visit a city, and  now I have one locally, as well. I'm never disappointed by a visit to any location. I'll start my review by delineating all components. Atmosphere: located in the Harrah's casino second floor via elevator access only. As you step off the elevator, you're immediately greeted by the hostess station and a divine view of Las Vegas Blvd. If your visit is st night, as mine was, you have access to the beautiful glittering lights along the Blvd. My table was located to allow a perfect view of Caesar's Palace. It was stunning. Location: centrally located on LVBlvd, in a very fun part of the strip. Lots of casinos and activities are in this area. Service: exceptional- everything you expect and then some. Presentation: the meal looks as if it's art on a photo shoot. No detail is spared. Product: the food was amazing. Packed with flavor, hot, seasoned, sautéed and sauced to perfection. Moist and tender where need be, crisp with a crunch as described, melt in your mouth goodness. All 5 areas made this dining experience a clear 5 star rating. I love a brand that delivers in all areas.",1
"This is probably the best Indian food I've ever had! Spicy but the kitchen is very agreeable to dialing back the spice if you need a milder version.  So far, the Butter Chicken is my favorite but I'm working my way through the menu. The Naan is heavenly so don't miss out on that.The tandoor is out where you an watch how it's made.  Oh and try the samosas even though they are so pretty you'll be reluctant to cut into them! Half orders are available if you have a smaller appetite or want to mix it up.I believe this is a family-run establishment--one of the best things about the Mint is the staff.  Everyone is friendly and accommodating and customer-oriented which is a refreshing change from my usual experiences.  Also, the place is lovely--truly date-worthy!",1
"I have nothing but good things to say about this company. I lost my keys to my suv at a restaurant late last night and needed help. Kevin was not only the first to respond, but was also the most affordable. I had a new key and back on the road within the hour. I can't thank him enough and will absolutely refer him to friends or family if they find themselves in the same situation I was in. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!",1
Great all you can eat and drink brunch. You can sit outside overlooking the pool and order as much food as you like. They have different flavors of mimosas plus different specials to order every time. Great to go with a group. Definitely top of our brunch list.,1
Simply put the best taco I've ever had. Everything here is authentic and fresh and tasty as hell. Came here with a couple of friends who are Totally addicted to their Mexican food. And I have to say I was so impressed that I'll be coming back here again and again. I just ordered a basic taco and actually ended up having three. Because they were so darn good. If you're in the area you absolutely have to try this amazing place.,1
Ok... driving up I didn't have high hopes.  Walking in it was clean but empty and again I  didn't have high hopes.Give this place a chance!   Turns out it was probably the best Italian American (settabello has my napolitano pizza heart) I have had in Vegas.   Not only was it delicious but we got great service from the owner.   Yes you could say that was because we were the only ones in there but you could tell that he really cared. And they have gluten free!   I'm definitely coming back!,1
"Friendly, quiet, and the Italian food is quite good. Suggested: meatball pizza, fiery mule, stuffed banana pepper soup. Small places like this can use help from the community and the reviews can be misleading. Try it.",1
"We got a couple of things. Firstly, a giant chocolate dome that was like a slice of chocolate cake covered in icing. It was super moist and something like a ho-ho glammed up. Your will power will be extremely challenged by it. Also loved the date bar. Overall excellent GF pastries and must say, their to-go salads are great as well (try the brussel sprout or the bean salad). Clean cute shop, but in general not much atmosphere here, so take your cookies to go.",1
Great food and drinks... Love going at least three times a month !!! Guests from other States have enjoyed this restaurant 100 percent of the good times !,1
"If you are visiting Montreal, definitely make this one of your places to visit. Parking here is $10/day. If you can, take the metro. The gardens are a short walk from the Pie-IX metro stop. We went during a Saturday afternoon, probably around 3-4pm. The line to get in was huge! They have free wifi near the ticket booths, so use your smart phone to go to their website to purchase tickets - it'll save you about 30 minutes in wait time! Then just show your phone when you go to walk in. Jardin Botanique accepts student ID's from the US so we were able to get  in at discounted rates.There are clean bathrooms and drinking fountains throughout many of the buildings within the gardens. Save your money and skip out on buying a water bottle at one of the stands.The gardens are absolutely wonderful. You must make it a point to see the Chinese and Japanese gardens - two of my favorite areas within this place.",1
"I had an AMAZING experience from the moment I called to inquire about the producer, until the moment I was helped to my car after surgery. I had to have, my one and only wisdom tooth removed and I was very nervous, to say the least. EVERYONE went out of their way to ease my anxiety. The front desk was VERY friendly, we started on time, my nurses were SO sweet and made me feel comfortable asking the hundreds of questions that were running through my head. Dr. Lamb came in shortly after, listened to all my concerns, went over all the pros and cons, and spent a lot of time communicating with me to make sure I understood what would be taking place from start to finish. He was very kind and made me feel like he really cared. Once I woke up, after surgery,  another nurse helped me to my car and he was very kind and caring as well. I got a phone call from Dr. Lamb a few hours later to check in on my recovery and to answer any new questions I had at that point. A huge THANK YOU to Dr. Lamb, Brad, Lisa, Gina, Kelly, Brittany, and Christina for making my experience a great one!! I will recommend this office to EVERYONE I know!!",1
"The hubby and I eat here almost every weekend for breakfast.  Always good!   he's a bit picky... and the waitresses never get irritated. Banana nut muffins rock, and I love sitting on the patio for the views.. not a fan of people bringing their dogs to sit out there.. but other than that.. its one of my FAV places.",1
"Great service. Got to us really fast and was patient while I was doing the whole ""umm"" thing. 3.99 for a huge boba milk tea. About 12$ for eight mini macaroons and a macaroon ice cream sandwich. We got to the end and he gave us the milk tea for free after helping us do a check in a review. There was only one guy but he was super friendly.",1
This place actually just moved and is worth the trip: http://www.yelp.com/biz/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson-3,1
"Great service!!!! Out of my BK expirerencs I been to, this one was by far the greatest :) The girl up front Victoria was awesome and super patient! The impossible whopper was delicious! Recently just went vegetarian too so I was really wanting to try this plant- protein burger and it far exceeded my expectations... hands down! Nik was great as well as Breeana! And shout out to James, in back of house for cooking it up! :) You guys rock, keep it up!",1
Great little hidden treasure!  Great food!  Great service! Great prices!  The best Chicken Fried Rice!  Great staff!  Kyle is especially nice!,1
"Pretty much every bar I've been since Jake & Eli has been utter disappointment... which is to say, Jake & Eli is amazing! Their black cherry drink is strong and bold. We were so happy they were located inside of the Westin. Great if you're trying to stay in - which is super hard in Vegas. I'd recommend this bar to anyone. Their specialty drinks are one of a kind.",1
"I live outside of DC and often travel to Scottsdale to visit family and love the Waverly so much that I wait to get my hair done when I am in town.  This place offers a great experience from the time you step in the door to the time you leave.  Sharri at the front desk is always a friendly face and remembers me even after months away. I have seen both Tara and Andie and have had a great experience with both.  I love the Pureology Shampoo and would recommend the Unite 7 seconds.  If you are looking for a solid salon to keep going back to, the Waverly is it!",1
Fun atmosphere and nice drinks. Intimate space would reccomend reservation big time but worth it. Great drinks and service! 100% recommend. Btw it's in a business. Stairs under tiki hut for undertow business above by different name so no worries address is right just need to go in you'll find it. Kinda fun ;),1
"Same owners as Old Towne Glendale Wine and Beer Bar.  I will be reserving the entire B&B for the night of our wedding, and I can not wait!  Everyone here is so nice, and the remodel is amazing.  Every room of this 10 Room B&B is fantastically furnished with antiques, and has their own restroom.  The building itself if magnificent.  I really think these guys are going to capture a great audience!",1
"Ok.  I've been going to this cleaners for month's now and I'm impressed, at least as you can be with dry cleaning.  Prices are fair, service is friendly, and they will even do your stuff the same day if you prefer.  They even notate your preferences in their computer so they know how you like your clothes prepared, i.e. starch or no on your shirts, etc.  For people who care, they use environmentally friendly cleaning solution and such.By the way, if you need an alterations person, Monika works on site and is there most days until late afternoon.  She is friendly and very proficient.  Does an excellent job whether it's a pair of jeans or a suit.  Again, reasonable prices and turnaround time.",1
"Really authentic Thai food.  They have regional Thai food, which very rare in the states.   Plus the server is very cute and super friendly.",1
"If you are wanting some great wine and an Italian meal, look no further! The fantastic food was equaled with the quick and courteous wait staff. The crab/lobster stuffed ravioli with shrimp atop was soooo damn good!  WOW   Save some room for their great desserts. Prosecco is perfection!",1
I had a wonderful experience at David Scott Salon and Spa! I read the reviews online and decided to give it a try. I had an express mani and a signature pedi with Angie. She was fabulous! She was very professional and took the time to get to know me. My pedi was heavenly and she really worked on my feet. It was a little more than I like to spend on a mani/pedi ($70 for the two) but it was worth it. I will definitely be going back to Angie.,1
"Easily the best dining experience of 2017. Each bite of the 7-course tasting menu was thoughtful, creative and delicious. Service was incredibly attentive, relaxed and genuine. My partner and I are complete wine-newbies, and our server recommended an amazing Italian red that complimented our dinner. From the stupidly tasty food, to the '90s hip-hop soundtrack, to the personal level of service from Chef Kang and his team, our night was definitely one to remember.",1
"Always spectacular. Amazing food, great service, and a fun and intimate atmosphere. As a vegetarian, I don't have a ton of options as far as the dishes, but that's ok because the relleno and veg and cheese enchiladas are all excellent. Sometimes the red sauce makes me sweat. And I like that.",1
"I'm soo happy this place in doing well! It no joke deserves ten stars! The staff - Amazing, knowledgeable and helpful! Five starsFood- FANTASTIC! They have a soup of the day which is always amazing. Unique yet traditional Mexican street food. Full of flavor! Everything! Nice portion sizes, and although the menu is on the smaller side I have yet to be bored. Beverages- So fresh! Amazing options!I promise that you will not be disappointed! I have a feeling I'll be back on a weekly basis!",1
"I had Winter Bros come out to my house to spray. We had way too many creepy crawlers. I was referred to them by another long-standing happy customer. They returned my call promptly, showed up on time, were very courteous and did an amazing job. I have not seen a bug since!  Their prices were affordable and no contracts. Highly recommend them if you need this service!",1
"My wife's idea to check this place out today after she saw it on an episode of Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives and she had been there before during work but not in a long time.  The food was really good pub grub style food but the main reason for the 5 stars is the service, it was outstanding!  Wasn't just one server, it was like everyone who worked in the restaurant worked together, if someone came by and saw your drink low they got you a refill.  If they saw and empty food tray they took it.  I think we had at least 4 different people work our table at one time or another.  Also highly recommend the Pimp'N Fries appetizer.",1
Yum!! My husband eats here all the time in Chicago. We are so happy to finally have one in Las Vegas. Lots of yummy food.,1
"Many copycats but Fat Tuesday 100oz yardstick is the benchmark. 6 locations in Vegas:Caesars, Imperial Palace, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, StratospherePlanet Hollywood location is located in Miracle Mile Shop (Circle mall)Warning: daiquiris will dehydrate the crap out of you so drink twice as much!",1
All across the board great experience with Brenda and her team. They are very knowledgeable and answered all my questions.. As a first time buyer the experience was smooth and painless. I would highly recommend Brenda and most definitely use her office again in any future purchase..,1
Came in on a Friday night to watch some sports and sat at the bar and Aylissa was great! She asked me what I liked to drink and made me a specific drink which tasted just like a jolly rancher! Ahhhhhmazing. Food was great and the service was ever better. Highly recommend and can't wait to be back.,1
"Are you looking for some of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh? Then look no further! The strip district is a microcosm of the diverse and local food selection that Pittsburgh has to offer. There are landmark restaurants in this such as Pamelas and Delucas while there are also new and changing restaurants such as the hip smallman gallery that is one building with 4 different small kitchens (usually only 2 people preparing food) that all serve one large area. At smallman the restaurants will change every so often and new start ups will be invited in to try to make a name for themselves and hopefully land a brick and mortar store somewhere in the city. There are many other types of businesses as well. If you are looking for wearable Pittsburgh gear the strip is the place to be. Stop by the strip district meat store to grab a wide array of meat including some of the best bacon and sausage I've ever had, elk, alligator, and even snake. Also for the out of town visitors, the Primanti Bros located in the strip is the original location.  There is too much in this area to name it all. Weekends are crowded and the strip closes down early so get there early!",1
"Of all the Meathead locations - from here to Chicago, the Champaign location trumps all. They have the best kindest managers/employees- it's always a great experience at such a positive place - we love dining-in. By far our favorite location and restaurant in Champaign, IL. Cheers!",1
"Its my all the time favorite coffee house. The coffee is just superb and the brewed coffee is just as good. They feature different beans as house espresso if you were lucky you will get to have something real interesting with a balanced acidity , floral and complexity robust flavor. Brewed coffee is fresh , full of aroma I always amused how their brewed coffee would taste so scrumptious. With the view of the River dale park and skyline of downtown. Life is all good all of a sudden.... Not only the coffee are brilliant also they have a variety of ice tea in the summer season, this year they came out cucumber lemonade which is very interesting. I still think the raspberry lemonade is the winner. The pastries is all right nothing special. If you are like me Into pastry I sometimes go to Andrews bakery a block away .  I am also not recommend hot chocolate unless you are a fan of those store bought hot chocolate marshmallow powder I personally hate it, it's just not the real deal where is the chocolate?  Well that's just me.  I'm attached to this little cafe I took all my dates and tell all my friends about this place and a regular to both locations.",1
"There I was at Discount tire early this morning hoping to be at least one of the first 3 to get in. Well that didn't happen so I realized I needed a place to go. And there was Crackers across the street. Ok maybe not right across but close enough to walk.The first thing I saw as I approached was a big line of chairs outside. That might mean people like this place?? Apparently because it was busy. But I got a great seat near a window and service was excellent. The waitress knew her menu and made recomendations when I asked. She even knew to ask me what I generally liked and was I looking for that or somethng different. Smart!In the end I ordered the same thing I have for 50 years, eggs, bacon, tomatoes and toast. Service is great, no blaring music, servers who pay attention but don't hover, good coffee, and busy with people who look like they return a lot.Breakfast is pretty hard to screw up but the bacon and the eggs are the give a way. Crisp doesn't  mean burned, and over mediam means soft yellow but finished egg. They got it absolutely perfect. Even the toast was warm, when it was delivered.Now I have to add them to my list of regulars like the Hoosier Cafe in Chandler wher I go every Sunday.",1
"What a nice restaurant.  Wait was a bit long, but expected for a new restaurant.  Food was so good and very fresh tasting.  Their homefries are the closest to my Dads fried potatoes I have ever had.  Will definately be back again.  I highly recommend you try it!",1
"My agent was fantastic. Scott Pisan is his name. I didn't interact with anyone else in the company really, but if Scott is any indication, you'll be in good hands. He was available constantly. He knew every detail of the entire process. He had ideas to solve every problem as small issue popped up. He explained things well, and offered candid advice to me when needed. Just can't say enough good things. Thank you, Scott!",1
Best sub shop in town!  The bread and pizza sauce they use are the best!!!  Highly recommend the Supreme or Chicken Parm.,1
I had the best veggie burger made with rice oats and black beans and wonderful seasonings.(Made fresh daiy) It was served on a lettuce leaf with fresh tomato slices and  perfectly grilled fresh asparagus with great seasonings We sat outside in Old Town and it was a beautiful day. Wonderful venue and we would be back again. their bloody mary bar equals none that I have been to and their burgers are fabulous!!!,1
"The owner greets you as though he is truly interested in you enjoying your experience in his restaurant, and I believe this guy will do very well...for a very long time. If you love chicken strips...don't eat them anywhere else again until you have had them here...and then go in understanding that you will never want to eat them anyplace else, ever again. The chicken strips are so good here they make you want to slap your momma. (For serving you the substandard ones you grew up eating.) Fast, friendly service, rewards cards, and an array of food choices that make it a little tough to decide what to try every time but....Just. Stay. Focused! You came for the chicken strips, which can be ordered baked, fried or grilled. Then comes an equally tough choice... the dipping sauces. The sweet chili and creamy wasabi are my personal favorites, and there are perhaps 10 others. The obligatory blue cheese and ranch are also far above average. The chicken portions are very generous, and regardless of how you order your strips they are served hot and super moist. It appears to be all white meat, and is obviously extremely fresh. As for the extensive choice for side dishes, I have enjoyed every one I have tried to date, however the mac and cheese is in the comfort food hall of fame. It is such a ridiculously cut above any mac & cheese I have ever had, that I could easily see myself stopping in at Strip & Dip just for an order to dine in, and one more for the road. The place is clean, the atmosphere is very laid back and welcoming, and if I lived just a little closer...I could be in serious trouble...at some point they may have to tell me to go home once in while.My grandchildren ask to eat here often, which actually makes quite a statement in and of itself, since they have fairly refined palettes, due to their Dad being a bit of a foodie.",1
We went here on a Saturday morning. It gets really busy so try to come early. The customer service was great! Our server was super chill and cool. There were so much to choose from at the menu. The selections are unique and some had a Latin fusion to the entrees. We started off with the empanadas which was amazing. You can tell the breading was different and the sauce with the cherry tomatoes was a perfect combination together. Both chefs were even there  to serve us our food. Also the chilaquiles was delicious! Coffee was okay.. Nothing special. It was more of a drip.  But overall great experience.Wish it wasn't so far tho!! But it's worth a trip to come back again.,1
Love this place!  Always clean and nice open layout.  Good selection and easy to request items that they may not currently have.  Great children play areas that my daughter loves.  Great for all ages!,1
Tammy and her team are AWESOME!  The work outs are great!  The people are  amazing! And the fun is non stop!  Tammy fosters a sense of caring and community among her staff and members that is second to none.  Anyone looking for a super fun workout with measurable results and great people will find it at Scottsdale Jazzercise Center.,1
"Yummmmmmm! Awesome tacos, really good salsa and amazing milk shakes. Will definitely be back soon!!",1
This is by far the best sushi restaurant I have EVER been to! Matt and B are fantastic! So fun and artistic. Their sushi skills are unsurpassed. I cannot believe how good this was! Thank you!,1
I recently hosted a large dinner group here and Dawn Hammond made it easy and comfortable.  Everyone had a wonderful time and  the food and  service was excellent.  John and Tiffany did a great job making sure everyone's wine glasses were full and that everyone was happy and well taken care of.  Overall I would recommend the Strip House for a fabulous evening.,1
"I have been to this place three times since they opened and am very pleased. The front staff was welcoming, the areas and tools are sanitized and very clean and the staff is personable and skilled. I also took my daughter for her first manicure/pedicure and she had a great time as well. I highly recommend it and will return again!",1
"I'm here almost daily! I love the vibes and the staff is always friendly. I ordered the impossible burger with yucca fries and let me tell y'all it was AMAZING Very vegan friendly, loves it",1
"Some of the best central American good I've ever had, including the meals I've eaten in Mexico, Nicaragua, Dominica (Caribbean, I know, but the cuisine shares similar characteristics), and Miami (let's be honest, ok?) If you want a lot of whiney bunched yelpanties to get in the way of a unique delectable culinary experience, then feel free to go to any other TexMex place. This is NOT TexMex. This is NOT southwestern. This is authentic Mexican, similar to what I found in Oaxaca and Colima. Expect fish, cinnamon, and sweet potatoes in the best recipes. And regarding the surly man in the hat that everyone cries about, a word of advice: Don't be annoying and you won't have a problem with him. I've been eating here for almost two decades and have never had a problem.",1
My new favorite place to get boba. Customer service was excellent and very helpful in helping me select my drink. I ended up taking the house milk tea with boba. The tea was $3.75 and the boba was $0.50. The milk tea itself is very authentic! Best I've ever had in along time. They allow you to pick your level of sweetness as well! I picked 80% which was perfect for my liking! I will definitely be back no doubt!,1
Excellent food Felt like eating at home away from homeHighly recommended Must eat here when in Vegas,1
"As an esthetician in the brow industry for awhile, I was hesitant to do microblading at first. I took Neeziie's Microblading class and it was very informative! She's such a sweet woman and has always answered any questions I've had if I needed her.",1
Since they fixed the seating area up I like this location. Service seems quick and friendly .,1
our family has been coming here for years. the staff is so helpful and professional and knowledgeable. Dr Gramlich and Dr Melissa Gramlich are both great doctors and very personable. everything is first class.,1
"It was about 230 am or so and I needed to refuel with cheap coffee and overly fried foods. Decisions, decisions!! Dennys, I hop, or waffle house?? Dennys it was!! If I chose according to feel good food, waffle Casa was a no brainer and if I had a fix for some fatcakes smothered with confectionary crack then ihop reigns supreme. After 2 the bars/clubs are emptied out and late night diners get rushed so I chose Dennnys for the service alone. Adam was there, as per usual, to  make my experience flow smoothly. When im that hungry Im more interested in getting my food in the quickest way possible so it adds that much more to my meal to have it arrive with charisma and a smile.",1
"Beautiful hotel! There are random events that take place in the lobby, which I didn't really partake in, but to each their own. The decor is tasteful and modern in the public areas, hallways, and rooms. The customer service was excellent, but I think that about all Marriot's so nothing new for me there....keep up the excellent work! Anything they don't have readily available in the room, they can bring you. Once I needed a bottle opener, this time I forgot toothpaste and q-tips.  Things were brought in a timely fashion and with a friendly smile!Cool things about this hotel....-Yes, it's kinda far from the strip, but for $5 you get a 24hr pass to the shuttle that goes all the way to the other side of the strip (stops at MGM, I think) and one leaves every minutes. -pool is open 24hrs, it is outdoors, but it's Vegas so most of the time it's still warm enough to swim or at least cool enough to cool your feet off and hang out after a night of dancing and walking the strip. -valet available, but there was also plenty of parking",1
Unique atmosphere in the city of Glibert with AMAZING food....  Beware some weekends the line is super long but its worth the wait... be prepared to eat outside in a nice shady area enjoying a farm like atmosphere...Good seafood is hard to find in Az & Farm grill does a great job.... also great burgers!  If you don't mind driving out to Gilbert its 1 of the best places to eat in the Phx area..,1
"If you're going to become a regular at any bar in Vegas, this is the one.Yes half-price steaks after midnight are the selling point. But at any hour, unless you're a meathead or a meathead's female equivalent, this is your bar. Walk in, be greeted warmly, get drunk, have a great time. A treasure.",1
Looking for a traditional barbershop open on the weekends - check!  Online reservation was a definite plus and worked great with very fast response!  Greg did a great job of trimming beard to specifications.  Highly recommended.,1
"After my bike stopped working I was at a loss, since I needed it quickly. LV Powersports was fairly close and they came to pick it up a few minutes after I called them. The service was incredibly quick and the next day my bike was running again!The mechanics at LV Powersports are very knowledgeable, incredibly friendly and always there for you.Even after I had another problem, a few days later, i was able to bring it in immediately and everything was fixed in a few hours!!Defintely my bike mechanic to go from now on! I would wholeheartedly recommend this shop to any biker!",1
"I cannot speak highly enough of Lakeside. While traveling across the state I had engine issues with my RV just outside of Boulder City. With three dogs and an old cat, limping into BC in 2nd gear was not fun and had the potential to be very stressful if a mechanic couldn't solve the problem quickly. As a transient customer, I was referred to Lakeside locally. Marc fit me right in...pets and all. He identified the problem, repaired it   (while the pets and I waited in comfort) and took us on a test drive to be 100% sure. This is a truly family owned and operated business, not a franchise. His wife kept us company for a bit and we met their son and grandson as well. This is exactly the type of business and individual that a customer builds a relationship with and whom becomes extended family. They have ethics and are extremely kind and affordable. They had me in a tough situation and I would have cheerfully paid extra to avoid a hotel...yet the bill was half of what I expected. I am more than a little sad they aren't closer to where I live so I may entrust them with all of my vehicles...but you can bet when I come through the area, I will be busy compiling a list.  I may even tow my beloved yet fickle vintage muscle car to them and spend a nice mini vacation in Vegas while they work their magic. Yes...they really are that great.",1
"I walked in and discovered Mr. Bruce!!!  He gave my daughter (6 years) a wash, and cut. She has very very coily tight curls, which he took his time to wash her hair then comb through it.She told me afterward  he is more gentle then you. He was friendly, professional and courteous. I also had a wash and trim, which not only had my hair looking so much healthier but also I loved the products he choose for my curl texture. I can not recommend Bruce enough for children and adults!! So grateful we discovered him and he will forever be our stylists.",1
"I had a estimate done one day and the installation was the next day!  Jose and Lujandro did the installation and worked all day.  They didn't sit around and waste time-they were working! They were polite and out down tarps to avoid tracking a mess through the house and then cleaned up after themselves.  Ricardo came a week later to check on the system and did the same thing. I would use them again. In the six weeks since the new system was installed,  my electric bill has decreased by 35%.",1
"This might be the best massage I've ever had. Paula is an amazingly talented and gifted therapist. She found and focused on spots I hadn't even realized needed work. As another reviewer noted, she somehow finds the pain, and more importantly, she makes it go away. I walked out of her office feeling like I was in a new body. She has an unbelievably kind energy, and she made me feel immediately at ease. Frankly, I was a little nervous about booking a massage in a city like Vegas, but this was a ridiculously wonderful experience. Within minutes of finishing up, I was inquiring about trying to get my wife scheduled for a massage before we had to leave town. I cannot recommend her more highly.",1
"I have never had breakfast this exceptional! ! The service is fast and professional. I recommend everything on the menu,  you just can't go wrong!",1
"I don't know when I've ever been pleased with having a repair done......until today!  My snowthrower auger was bent and I expected to need a replacement which ran around a hundred bucks plus labor.  And then there's a hassle of getting the machine TO the repair shop!   Haight's made all my problems go away with just one phone call.    He was right on time and surprised me when he said he thought he could bend the auger back into shape.   Sure enough, he fixed the auger so well that I couldn't tell the unbent auger from the one he had fixed!   The repair bill was very reasonable, but best of all, they are a MOBILE service and will come to you.  And for less than I'd expect to pay in a repair shop where I would have to muscle that heavy machine to get it there.    I highly recommend Haight's Mobile!",1
Yesterday was my first time here. My mother and I were looking over the menu outside and a woman came out to talk to us and see if we had questions about the menu. She was very friendly. We decided to eat on the patio and had an absolutely delicious beet salad with arugula and salmon. I highly recommend this dish. The service was prompt and friendly. I would absolute recommend this place.,1
"I bought my car at this Toyota in 2010 and had the worste time with getting things fixed or repaired. There was always a problem and they always overcharged...That being said, I went there today to get my oil changed and Todd in the service center treated me better then I've ever been treated there. Explained that I had low pressure in one of my tires which caused the tire to be unsafe. He gave me a better quite for 4 tires then walmart and big of tires and made my car safe with some tires they had laying around. Honestly, they surprised the craps out of me. I'll always go back to Todd.",1
"RTH feels like a institution. A symbol of Toronto style, it's architecture, it's people and it's live performance. Been here a couple times for symphony. Fist time had cheap seats on third level. Most recently came to see Handel Messiah holiday performance with amazing seats just a couple rows from the stage in main level. Huge difference in the experience and would get better seats again if I can afford it :)I did read online that acoustics vary based on your seating. Would have to agree, for the close up seats we had, at times the sound seemed... not directed toward us. When we sat at higher seats in the past I would say the acoustics might be slightly better if not the same. The lobby is expansive all around the theatre in a circle. I enjoy walking around and seeing everyone dresses up for Evening performance. There is more than one set of bathrooms. So if you see a long line up, keep wandering and you can find another bathroom. This is a great place for a date. Or to take your parents. It's also fun just to linger a couple minutes longer in the lobby after the production. Sometimes they have a small performance or band in the lobby afterwards.Parking lots are nearby, at least 3 come to mind. Price will be around $15 for the evening parking yikes! So if you can take ttc or walk on over. Ttc subway is connected to RTH.",1
"They have a lot of old gaming systems and they warranty all systems for one year to work. I have bought Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Nintendo Gamecube, Xbox 360 R2D2. I have bought games from Bubble bobble to Zelda for NES. I have bought over 60 games from this place.",1
"The place did not disappoint. The moment we stepped through the archway, my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area. It really DOES feel like a tavern, almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean (Well.. kind of)But yeah, the portions were overwhelming, and best of all? The food was spectacular. I sat outside, but honestly? I think the place is pretty both ways, so don't be too stingy on the location :)Jus go.",1
"Awesome! We went for our 1 year anniversary and had made reservations ahead of time, they took great care of us and the entire staff was great. Great for a special occasion, they made us our  menus personally for us, wishing us a happy anniversary. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel catered to, we never needed refills or anything they were on top of it! AND the food was excellent, the wine selections were great too. Great way to spend a quiet romantic evening",1
"Amazing little place for a quick snack. . . Fries are alright and for 5 bucks inside the Bellagio, I got exactly what I paid for. Staff is super friendly!Next time for sure I'll try something other than just fries. Can't wait to visit this place again!",1
"I've lived very nearby for a few years now and finally gave this place a shot. The fun exterior always caught my eye. Today I wanted to walk somewhere for a quick bite nearby and decided to try something new. I'm not much of a burger person, but I read so many reviews saying this was the best burger in Cleveland so I tried it out. I just got a plain burger with American and bacon, and it was SOOO good. I ordered a side of the root beer barbecue sauce and ended up pouring it all over my burger. That sauce alone would be the reason I came back, but I think what really sold it for me was the bun it came on. I usually rip excess bun off of my burgers and sandwiches, but every edge of this bun was crispy and flavorful, even the bites where the meat didn't quite reach were delicious. As for fries, theirs were crispy and seasoned which makes them and A+ for me. I got the white Florida sauce to dip them in which was very good, but the fries even stood alone without it. Service was quick and friendly and they had a unique selection of soft drinks as well. I will definitely be stopping in more often, excited to try the Mac and cheese bites next.",1
Kate made a cake for my son's cake smash photo shoot. She was so nice to ask if he had any allergies and had been introduced to dairy during our phone call. The cake was amazing! Incredible flavor and moist so it was easy for him to break and eat. He wouldn't stop eating it! Def coming back for more. Thanks Kate!,1
"I have been to a lot of ramen places in Vegas, this place is One of the best places I have gone for ramen! My friended ordered a side of kimchi and it was delicious as well!",1
"I never got my haircut since I had so many bad experiences. Being relatively new to Charlotte and having only tried the Paul Mitchell salon in Southend (it was okay, but not what I wanted and they tried to convince me to color my virgin hair), I was wary of another new adventure.It was such a great and non-complicated experience. Laura (level 1) took care of me and knew exactly what I wanted without even needing a picture. I have a lot of hair, but I like long layers that for some reason no stylist had mastered until T Reid. They use Pureology in their great lineup of salon products, which was another plus- I didn't leave without the yummy smelling spray Laura used during my style.",1
im a big sushi fan n i got to say out of alot of place ive tried in vegas this is surely one of the BEST!!! they got amazing happy hour!..the waiters are very nice n friendly i prob come here every two weeks n they know me n my orders lol...this place is very chill n there booths are what japanese style so u take your shoes off but i really recomend coming here n tryin a few of there amazing sushi rolls!!!!!,1
"I was never a big fan of pho, but I really like this place. $10 gets you a big bowl of pho topped with beef. Unlike other phos, the soup in this place actually has a flavor. Also, the hot sauce they provided on the table does not taste sour at all.",1
This is my 2nd time going to cc's they are always really nice. They always offer water or tea. They place always looks really clean which is the most important thing that I look for in going to do my nails. They are very detailed on my pedicure and I did the basic one too. They take their time in removing cuticles and dead skin. I will be returning again!,1
My young daughter just started her first dance class here and we love it!! Her teacher is amazing she is very professional and warm at the same time.  My daughter looks forward to going to her class every week. I am so happy to have found this studio and can't imagine going anywhere else.,1
Awesome experience. Great break from the strip with the magical smell of cordite. Staff is very professional and friendly. Really enjoyed my trip and will be going back for sure. Also got a kick out of the open air museum. They even had all the equipment that I used to work on.,1
"This is where the vegans need to dine while in Las Vegas!!!! This is a nice restaurant, rather upscale with a good cast of diners. Definitely a place to put on a nice outfit for. I'm wondering if they had a dress code as the hostess recklessly eyeballed my bfs flip flops on the way to our table. So the average price of a meat eaters plate was fairly pricey (50-100$ a plate) but MAN did the vegans score big time with this place!! The most expensive vegan option (they had an entire menu all vegan) was like 28-30$ compared to my bfs 65$!!!! And it was delicious and beautifully prepared. Eat vegan here, eat cheap(Er) enjoy the view and the evening breeze. I was highly impressed! My bf got seafood pasta and for the first time in his life, couldn't finish eating all the seafood as it was so plentiful in the meal.",1
I was sitting at the light at 7 St & Greenway and Yelp alerted me to a new nearby restaurant.  I went in and once i figured out the menu i ordered 2 tacos an Al Pastor and a Carne Asada. A bit pricey for a taco but unlike inexpensive tacos doesn't have ground up mystery meat in it. A selection of 3 cheeses and 3 hot sauces. I ordered Spanish Rice on the side and when i upgraded to a meal got a side of refried beans. Both were good. With the upgrade you get a bag of chips not a bag that you have to wonder if there is 2 or maybe 3 chips but a nice good size bag. With two tacos beans and rice I brought most of my chips home. Great tasting food worth the price for the quality.  Next time I'll try a burrito. And yes i will be back.Ok it's been a few weeks and I did go back for the burrito. Unless your eating for three save a buck and a half and buy the smaller one. The full size was good packed full but way too much for one person for lunch. But if you must get the bigger one.......it's great!,1
"Impressive! This place in Cosmopolitan was a gem. Chicken Karaage bun-5/5. Tasty,tasty and tasty.Roasted Mussels-5/5. Fresh and smoky! Sweet and Sour Long Beans-3/5. The dressing was too much.Smoked Pork Belly-5/5. The highlight of the visit. Super good. Spicy Cucumbers-4/5. It's ok.Cocktails-5/5. Strong and delicious! We had a super attentive server. We sat at the bar and had a good assessment of the food prepping! Customers here were happy!",1
"The best Italian I've had in a very long time. I choose to eat/support locally owned restaurants and this is a perfect choice. Their food is fresh, staff is prompt and pleasant. The food is very well prepared, fresh ingredients and well thought out pairings. Can't wait to go back!",1
"My wife and I were traveling to Montreal to celebrate our anniversary and see the sights. Robin Square was perhaps the highlight of our entire trip. The food was amazing. We have traveled a bit and enjoy eating everything from high cuisine to street food. The Fried Polenta, Mac & Cheese Remix, and The Ultimate Experience (pork belly) rank at or near the top of our all-time meals list. The staff was fantastic and the space was lovely. It is a must-visit restaurant.",1
"Can I give 6 stars?Lentil soup was great.Salad was fresh and delicate.Star of the meal was the gyro meat and Tzatziki Sauce was, hands down, the most amazing thing I've ever eaten. Moist, tender meat and the dill in the Tzatziki Sauce marry together perfectly.Will absolutely be back.That said, don't come if you're the type who demands perfect service. This is a family owned place and because of that, it can take a bit to get a refill or silverware but if you're willing to ask, they're more than happy to provide whatever you need.",1
"Nice family owned business. They make the churros fresh. Lots of options for toppings but I like the basic churro and it's as good as the ones I get when at Disneyland. Not sure how well the area is doing, as it looks like most of the businesses in that section have closed. Seems like the only 2 remaining are Johnny Rockets and the Harkins theater everything else is empty. Don't buy your churros on amazon, Support your local shops",1
This place is so good fresh sushi..it seems like its happy hour all the time because its very affordable..My favorite is the seaweed salad and the crazy jalapeno  roll. It has no rice :),1
I loved the ribs and smoked brisket!  Good mac n cheese and greens cooked with ham hock.  A nice cozy place to eat or to wait for your take out.,1
"Travis and Paul helped me with the move last week. They were swift & efficient. They wrapped my furniture to protect them any inadvertent ding during the move, packed all the  small items laying around into boxes, and  finished my move in less than 2 hours.  When I called them up , the earliest they could do was 8 am but on the day of the move , they accommodated my schedule and arrived earlier by 7:15 so I could get to work on time. Just one suggestion for them is to let customers know ahead that they need to pay only  by cash. It caught me by surprise on the day of the move , but I had ATM nearby , so it was fine.",1
"This review is mostly about the food:AMAZING!  The food is Mexican food with a twist and I loved it!  I ordered the chicken torta but honestly the only part I didn't like was the chicken.  Next time I would order the tofu torta instead.  It came with spinach, black refried beans, cheese, and chipotle sauce.  It all worked together REALLY nicely.  My girlfriend (a vegan) ordered the tofu torta and was in heaven as well.  The website says they offer dairy-free cheese but they were all out when we went but she said it was still tasty.  Also, they have gluten-free bread which tasted like regular bread.   Make sure you order the chips and guac since they really do complete the meal.  The $4 margaritas were to die for but the wine selection or full bar are also available.The ambiance is of a lounge and not where you'd expect to find good food.  I'd recommend coming earlier before it turns into a nightclub.  I've been here dancing and it doesn't seem practical to eat here later on since it gets crowded and really loud.All in all the prices are GREAT value for the flavors in your mouth!",1
"Pieology is finally joining the plant based world by adding vegan cheese and THREE vegan meat options! The vegan italian sausage was delicious.  The service was exceptional.  The good tasted great.  This is going to be a regular spot for me.Pieology, please dont charge more for plant based options!!!! Work on that!",1
"Wow, Customshop impressed us! My husband and I didn't travel for the holidays and we decided to try a new restaurant for Christmas Eve. It had been a while since my last visit (Elite event way back in the day) and I thought this may be a good, quiet place to dine. It was fantastic.We made reservations, which are recommended...and if you want a booth, supposedly you have to make those months in advance. Who knows where they'll be eating that far in advance? Not this girl. Anyway, the tables were fine although a booth would have been slightly cozier. The service was great! Attentive, but not intrusive and in no way did we ever feel rushed. The wine list was extensive, but not overwhelming. We started with the cheese plate followed by our main entree and vegetables. It was just the right amount and made deliciously! I had the scallops and they were divine! Besides the quality of the food, the ambiance and visual presentation is top notch. The decor is rustic, yet classy. They know how to set the mood with dim lighting and dining by candlelight. The food is thoughtfully placed on the dishes and is picture perfect and ready to eat.I love that this place is local and rotates its menu to reflect what food is seasonal. I also like that they support area farms and add where they get their items on the bottom of their menu. It's like a win-win-win: us-them-community. Yay.It's a new local favorite and I'm sorry it took me so long to return. Now that it's on the list of great places, we'll be back soon and happy to recommend to others.",1
"Started my treatment with Tim and Brian back in October after an unfortunate car accident. They are two very intelligent gentlemen who have taken me in like family and seem to have very firm understanding on their profession. They provide you with copious amounts of information to give a better understanding as to what is going on in your spine and many other aspects to your health. Not only did they alleviate the problems in my lower back from the accident, but they have improved my sleeping habits substantially. 5 stars does not do justice, thanks a lot guys!!!!",1
"Holy s#|+!!! This was some of the best brisket I have ever had...period. Then you toss in delicious bacon wrapped jalapeños, hush puppies and sweet potato fries!!! The reviews are all legit... this is a culinary destination worth your time and effort!",1
I'm really glad my wife and I found this place for our daughter.They have been really accommodating for us and the staff have been fantastic and I see no signs of that level of expectation changing. I love the reports we get at then end of the day with special captions that we can get insight in what our child is doing every day. I cannot stress how welcoming and engaging the staff are. Two thumbs WAY up!I look forward to a long tenure at this daycare for our daughter and future children.,1
Great place to eat.  Loved the deviled eggs and the salmon. Waitress was amazing. Can't wait to come back again.,1
We had lunch here and it was very good. The corn chowder was phenomenal. The view was amazing. Definitely recommend sitting outside if possible.  Our lunch was fabulous. Our service experience was great.,1
Love it here! Everyone was SO nice and made it so much fun. Nikki did an incredible job creating some magic on my really pathetic nails. An absolute little gem of a nail salon & super cute inside!,1
The best place ever . this is my happy place .. Help me get threw the day ...  Everyone need to came and take a ride,1
Great food and fast friendly service.  Would go there again the next time I'm in town.  Only went because of the good reviews on here and is worth the time and money. Parking can be a challenge but there is a parking ramp near by that we used.,1
"This specific location is awesome! I usually always get the animal style burgers and fries and this is the one location that drenches both the burger and fries with their delicious sauce. If you want a good burger, come here!",1
"So nice to get away from the strip and find this awesome cafe!Good seating, you're not sat on top of anyone.Nice chillout music.Good, friendly service.Well priced.My BLAT burger was fresh and delicious, and only $8.49, bargain!Phil had the Mocha, I had the raspberry white choc latte. Phil loved his as he has a sweet tooth, but I found mine a bit too sweet! My fault, I should have stuck with a drip coffee.",1
"This place has awesome food and a great atmosphere!  So many choices on the menu, and each and every one I had was delicious.  I'm an out-of-towner or I'd still be sampling some more :-)  The fish & chips was flaky and tasty, the Dubliner (lamb) was medium rare just like I ordered, juicy and delightful with carmelized onions, rosemary and real Irish cheese, and the champ (Irish mashed potatoes with green onions) was a great side dish to go with it. Can't wait to go back and try the chicken curry, shepherd's pie, smoked salmon appetizer (potato cakes are yummy!) and the beef and Guiness stew. It's the kind of place you wish you had 4 stomachs!!! The staff was charming and engaging, and it was fun comparing how the Ireland I visited 20 years ago has changed . . . and thankfully some of the ways it hasn't :-)The pub is divided into unique sections, and you really ought to see them all ~ what a feast for the eyes, all that beautiful wood, the exquisite carved bars, memorobelia true to the time on the walls, and knowing that it all was rescued/reclaimed from Ireland really means a lot to me. For those who want a tad more quiet (but who wants quiet when the band's getting your feet moving), there's a couple of lovely side rooms, one in rich theater theme, the other like a cozy family room in the 70s.  Even if you're not Irish, you've gotta check it out ~ it's a not to be missed experience for sure!",1
Had the three egg scramble with grilled pork tenderloin and jalapeños that was the special today. Absolutely delicious! If you have a party of six or more be sure to call ahead so you aren't waiting hours outside!,1
"Now that's it's closed, the old owner works at LVAC on Lake Mead and Rainbow. I get so bummed every time I see him because his burgers were so good.",1
"This is a very popular place. There are seats, but most are already taken. People are having a cup of coffee and talking about many things like businesses, relationships, and etc. Some people are reading news papers and other people are bringing their laptops. Their croissants are so good and coffee is excellent. There are varieties of drinks. I am going to take Honey Ginger Latte the next time!",1
"Got my oil changed here. The staff is really friendly, fast and they have competitive prices. Great communication and service. I'm coming back tomorrow to have some other things checked (they are nice enough to offer me a ride to work as well, while my car is being checked out). It's hard to find honest mechanics in this (or any) town. I'm glad they opened a Sun Auto by my house.",1
"Everything we wanted and more! Carlos our waiter was awesome! And we didn't even know this beforehand, but they have our absolute favorite dessert ever...the Butter Cake!! To die for!! Love that the menu has so many different options for drinks and food. My boyfriend and I came here for a nice mellow date night and it was absolutely perfect. I highly recommend! :)",1
This place is amazing.  I made reservations for five girlfriends and they gave us a special treat for that.  We ordered a good selection of food.  I split the turkey club sandwich and it was a huge portion.  Very tasty and the potatoes were perfect.  I tired some of the other wraps which were great too.  Then onto the main event. Dessert can't say anything more All amazing and decadent and heavenlyI highly recommend Decor amazing Prices goodAll halalService with a smile,1
The technician showed up and was able to get to work to find the issue in our front yard. Within 1.5 hours he fixed the main water line to the house and he was efficient and professional the entire time explaining what he was doing and how the device would fix the issue.Great job!!!,1
Fried chicken & fresh homemade biscuits. Enough said. I dream about this place. My favorite so far is The Farmer.  You know it's good when you're mouth is watering writing a review.,1
One of my new favorite spots to eat on the Strip! Food was great and my server Ivette was excellent! Definitely recommend this to anyone visiting!,1
"Have sampled several teas with boba or jelly - and love them all! So yummy. We eat here like once a week. Everything we've tried on the menu is good. Solid fried rice, great starters like egg rolls and pot stickers. Sauces are authentic and flavorful.  Every entree I've had is delicious, including the tofu. Lunch and dinner specials available on the weekend. Consistently good food. Use yelp check in, check signs for buy one get one's, and download the epoxy app to earn freebies.",1
"I came here after another place nearby was going to charge me $50 just to look at my tires and see if it was a tire problem or an alignment problem that I was having. They took my car back and showed me the huge bubble I had in the middle of the tread - yikes! I was really short on cash and could only get one tire replaced at the time, and unfortunately today the tread on my other front tire started separating. I brought my car in again and they were quick about popping on the new tire because I still had to go to work. I can't remember the name of the man who helped me both times (I'll have to check my receipt later and come back to edit this post), but he was very friendly and helpful, even early in the morning. They will definitely have my business again.",1
"first time went there this past  weekend.    it  WAS  hell a fun.   people was so nice,  the  bar  look fine  ,  great patin,  really a  fun place to go on sunday after noon.  beer ar  cheap ,   just go and have fun.   5  stars !!!",1
KIM is the best! Super friendly and always ensures that you are comfortable no matter how painful the procedure may be! The staff were super friendly and accommodating and made me feel relaxed The facility is super clean  and smells amazing!,1
I love Sports Grill 101!! the food is delicious. I would suggest getting the deep dish pizza. They aren't expensive and everyone there is so friendly :) Check out Sports Grill 101,1
Tried for the first time today and this place is so delicious! Best sandwich i've had in a long time honestly. Next time im getting extra meat,1
"Great restaurant!  Beautiful ambiance and friendly, attentive staff. The turkey cranberry sandwich was incredible, with the savory Brie offset wonderfully by tart cranberries-- absolutely perfect. And their cheesecake was deliciously smooth and creamy.  I will definitely be coming back.",1
"Dr. Machnau has been my dermatologist for several years.  I followed her from another practice and am so glad I did!  She is a first class physician...so easy to talk to, does a thorough annual skin cancer exam and always has great suggestions for care of my ""ugh"" starting to age skin.  I trust her completely and have recommended her to others.",1
"What an unexpected gem.  The volunteers are a wealth of knowledge of the history of the police department. Take a picture in a car or on the motorcycle. Admission is a donation, feel generous. They close at 3 so plan your visit early",1
"We got the Holy Davoli which is a burger with grilled cheeses as the buns.  It was heaven.  Melissa was our server was the best, cheerful, helpful and fun.  I will definitely come back any time I am in Las Vegas.",1
"5/5 on everything, and beyond.My boyfriend took me for our 8 year anniversary and had to book 2 months in advance for the extended tasting menu at the kitchen counter, where you get a front row seat to watch the cooks prepare dishes. We also did a wine pairing which elevated the experience even more. The service was outstanding - it's no wonder this is the #1 restaurant in Canada. It lived up to nothing short of the best dining experience. Ideal for special occasions, any foodie will appreciate these dishes that are works of art. The best was the wagyu beef dish - best piece of meat we have ever eaten.",1
"Okay now typically I try to review after I've been a couple times, and this is based on only a single visit during the Christmas season, however the visit was as good as it gets for a guy in a women's store so for the men out there who need to be creative with their birthday or holiday shopping check out Charming Charlie, and here is why: 1. The store is color coded. This makes me very happy. I know what colors the females in my life like and the ease of getting around the store by color cuts my stress in half. 2. There are no sales people following you around, however there are plenty to help a lost looking individual like myself. My questions were answered, my gifts were chosen and I was out in less than 15 minutes. 3. Classy but not pricy. The clothes and accessories are a classy look, that can be worn to work, out to dinner, or even just around town when your lady wants to look all fancy. I do classy but I don't do pricy, so this fits the budgets and I'd say the clothes have an expensive look to them.In finding Charming Charlie, I feel like I've just saved myself many hours and much stress the next time I need to shop for my sister, mother or other females in my life. In CC I have a simple, win-win solution to all that!",1
Some of the best tacos I've ever had. It's like being transported to Mexico when you take that first bite. The spicy pork tacos are so delicious. Wouldn't have ever expected tacos this good when I first saw the joint. A true gem in Vegas.,1
Great food! Do not go there after 3:00 as they close the kitchen at 3... not sure when they open after this. Food is great thiugh,1
"Best cuts in town, If you need a clean cut visit this shop and you will leave satisfied",1
"Have worked here for the last 6 years and absolutely love it. Couldn't ask for more out of a part time job while going to school. Flexible, benefits, well payed, and great people.",1
"This was a blast and a nice change from the gambling & strip clubs. Every boy's dream is to play with those tonka toy trucks, so us big boys had a blast playing with the real things. It was more fun then I expected, and in some cases more challenging as the equipment is more sensitive than I expected. Staff was all friendly and accommodating. We went in October so the weather was perfect. It might have been a lot rougher in August -- although the cabs are climate controlled. They do have a breath analyzer to test to make sure you aren't drunk when you come, so keep that in mind if you are drinking a lot prior to the event. I recommend this to anyone who has wanted to see what it was like to operate construction equipment.",1
"We have stayed here at the Luxor over 7 times for a total of around 20 nights. We have stayed in the East and West towers. The rooms are clean, have never had a problem with the house cleaning. We've asked for hypo-alergic sheets- no probem, wifi fixed- no probem, room service no problem, valet service- no problem, all restaurants and bars are great,  we particularly like the asian and sushi restaurant. The buffet doesnt compare to the Bellagio, Ceasars, or the M and neither does the price. Most of these reviews with 1 and 2 stars must be from people that want something for nothing. The hotel rates are fantastic and the staff bend over backwards to give you kind service compared to some of the other casinos mentioned. Do yourself and the staff at the Luxor a favor if you have a beer budget and champagne tastes stay somewhere else and bitch to them about how your glass slippers don't fit up your dairyaire.",1
"We purchased a beautiful piano from this consignment and we couldn't be happier! Since the consignment is conveniently located inside the building where Carefree local post office, I always have the need to stop by and check out the items. Items are reasonably priced. The employees are courteous. I highly recommend it!",1
This was so relaxing and amazing will definitely be back. Nana was the perfect amount of pressure and my feet feel great.,1
"Best nachos I've found in the Matthews/Indian Trail area so far.  You can customize basically everything, they have online ordering AND a salsa bar.  I love the salsa, but they make it fresh so heat levels can vary day to day.  Plus they have drink specials on many days, so if you sit there and eat, you might be able to get a $2 beer",1
"Always great, friendly service and awesome food. The lasagna is the best I have ever had!",1
"This restaurant has been here for 34 years serving French classique dishes. The service and the ambiance is great. We had the duck rillette with French pickles, the sautéed mushroom and the ravioli. They were all good. For sure l express is on my list of restaurant during my next  visit on Montreal.",1
"Ok, I've been here twice now and am totally loving it. First time was for dinner, and we tried everything on the menu.  The tacos are the street variety, that is they are soft corn tortillas. The tortillas are fresh made in-house and are AMAZING! The other things on the dinner menu are awesome, but the tacos and ceviche stand out the most. Dessert of flan (slightly firmer texture than expected, but very smooth) and tres leches were also amazing. They have an excellent drink selection as well. Second trip: brunch We started with the fruit plate, a very good selection of a variety of fruits and yogurt. I ordered the chorizo skillet, a very large portion of eggs, cheese and chorizo (spicy). It was awesome, and while I hopped to box up half of it, I ended up eating it all. Others tried all of the other brunch options. No complaints and many compliments. I'll also add that the coffee is excellent: I enjoyed it black. Peyton et al have done it again! Expect to see a lot more check-ins from me.",1
"I have been looking for a salon that uses Kerastase!  I took a chance on Euphoria and called yesterday to make an appointment. They had an opening today at 4pm so I took it!  When I arrived I was immediately greeted with a smiling face and a warm hello!  She got me all checked in and offered me citrus water while I waited, I was a little early. Larissa came out to get me right on time and took me for my consultation to determine my cut then back to shampoo and get started.  She NAILED the cut!  And even recommended some color I might consider that would go well with my eyes. Larissa was AWESOME!!  I will be going back and I HIGHLY recommend this salon!!",1
"My husband took me to see this show for our 20th Anniversary. Days later and I still can't for the life of me figure out how he did what we did! My husband and I would definitely consider ourselves skeptics of magic/mind reading but no longer. We looked at each other after every ""trick"" and said ""how the hell did he just do that?"" Definitely the most incredible show we've ever seen and there's no way you can leave there not feeling completely satisfied and blown away. Frederic is very likable and funny and the show moved at a good speed. It never got boring or dragged on. The size of the venue was fantastic - small and intimate. I'm telling all my family and friends to go see it next time they are in Vegas.",1
"GREAT FOOD!! Very friendly....the falafel wrap and the house dressing are fantastic. If you're not familiar with Indian/Mediterranean food, ask the staff to describe it....the Chicken Boti kabob entree is tender and seasoned perfectly. I'll be back!",1
Georgia assisted us she was great. This was our first time as gold members. Returning the car was also very easy. After being in the terminal for about 8 hours our flight was cancelled so we went to rent a car again. Georgia and her manager Nate helped make it happen at the same rate as we had been paying for the week.,1
"love this tanning salon! very clean, they change the bulbs regularly, the prices are fair, just as much as u would expect to pay anywhere else, and Sherri is such a nice person to chat with when ever you stop in. Always running specials, and even has an emailing list that sends out specials about once a month.",1
"Had a very nice time painting with a few friends on a Saturday evening. Studio fee was $6 for ""ladies night"" and I picked out a nice big bowl for $24. They have a lot of really neat painting techniques to try out--I went with just basic painting but I'd really like to go back and try the paint chips that melt when fired. Overall, was very relaxing, we didn't feel rushed, and I would return. Excited to see what my bowl looks like after being fired!",1
"I am astounded at the quality of this ""hole in the wall"" find.  Between a smoke shop and a cleaners, Brooklyn V's has blown me away.  Pizza shop?  No, this is a Brooklyn restaurant in the heart of Mesa, AZ.  I had spaghetti in clam sauce.  Where do I begin?  The pasta was al dente.  That's the first step to proving you care a bit about your food.  Next is tender clams, a TON of them, in a perfect sauce, mild with a hint of wine and garlic, sprinkled with parm and served with crusty Italian bread, baked locally and only sold to a choice few restaurants.  It absorbs the sauce perfectly, melting in the buttery, garlicky goodness.  There are only a few beers on tap.  I had the Shock Rock Belgian White, a perfect compliment to the light sauce and simple meal.  I was sent here by a local, the guy at Stamps Automotive, while they work on my car.  I cannot thank him enough.",1
This is my FAVOURITE bakery in the GTA! All of their yummy treats are made from premium ingredients and you can taste that in every bite. I've purchased cakes and sweets for many special occasions for large family gatherings and they've always been a hit with my non-vegan friends and family.  I recently transitioned to a Ketogenic diet and the sweet hart has the most insanely delicious pizza rolls and THE CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH!!!!!Support local and be sure to visit this toronto gem! Cannot wait for them to open up their next shop!,1
Love the French Onion Soup and the Soft Pretzel with the beer cheese!! Everything was so delish!,1
"Warm. Calming. Steady. Mindful. I will admit I first went here for Rian Harris' class, but the studio is by far Charlotte Yogas best location and the instructors are equally as great - so I keep going back. The locker rooms are large and have sufficient changing space. The larger studio room is mirrored and has the best floors ever. This room heats up quick so bring a towel and some water. The smaller room is sued for slower classes and sculpting. These classes are smaller, but just as intentional. The studio has subtle reminders everywhere that happiness is for everyone and Mindfulness is the goal. The floors are covered in these reminders. Hope to see you there on Tuesday-Thursday and Friday! Namaste.",1
Always so fresh and delicious delivery is amazing when we dont want to cook this is our spot to order from,1
Favourite restaurant in Arizona. Doesn't look fancy but the food is amazing. Definitely miss living in Arizona. I hit up this joint everything I fly back south from Toronto. California Surfing - chimichanga style is godly.,1
"Love, love, love this place!I love how the place is set up inside (although cozy comes to mind).  One side is a restaurant, the other side in another building is the loud bar but if the weather's great, you can sit outside in comfortable, sturdy seats. The food's good, I'm partial to the tacos and ribs, and the apps are plenteous. Come to Rebar to socialize, to relax and to have fun.",1
Loved my experience here. I was a loyal customer at another salon and got tired of being ignored and having an appointment last 3 hours. Vivian was fast and did an amazing job.   Got a pedicure and a fill with gel.  I'm a new faithful customer.,1
"We came here specifically because I heard it was the best place to view the Bellagio fountains. When we arrived, someone had just vacated the lounge area with the best view of the fountains. The view was absolutely amazing and breathtaking. I filmed part of the show then I sat back and enjoyed a couple of tasty cocktails. I had the coconut press drink and a sparkling pear martini. You should definitely try to catch a view of the fountains from the Hyde while sipping on a cocktail.",1
One of the best places I was in Vegas wowwwwThe staff was great and very helpful I did not hear my kids for a 2-3 hours they were busy with the games I definitely go there again,1
"We have used Carter twice now.. both times he has been PROMPT, communicative, professional and has completed the job at REASONABLE RATES in a timely manner.. we WILL Be using him again!",1
"I was a little disappointed that they raised prices, but given the high quality of the food offerred at this buffet, it's okay. Whenever I go to Vegas with friends, we always make an effort to go to this buffet and hit up the mimosa brunch. I just went with 17 other people this past weekend.Best item offered after 3p.m.: CRAB LEGS. YUM!Their dessert area is to die for! Unfortunately, I had too much mimosa this time around and didn't bother standing up until after we left. Till next Vegas trip, Wynn Buffet!",1
"Best sushi in the Phoenix Valley. All that need to be said. But I'll say more... get the Primo Roll and Green Dragon. Their Ramen is good too! The dining area is small so there may be a small wait, but it's worth it.",1
"Haven't been here in years! Came back with my youngest sister, she wanted to try sushi and I thought this was an ok place to have her try something out before branching out into other places. Immediately as we sat down we were asked what drinks we wanted. I had the chai tea and she had pink lemonade. To our luck as we stood up to start piling onto our plates the cooks brought out a few fresh sushi trays. We didn't have much to eat but we were please either the service either way.",1
"tldr: Authentic Japanese ramen for agreeable prices. Japanese-speaking staff. More than just ramen offered here. The girlfriend and I came here on a whim. It was the closest better-than 4 star ramen joint in the area. It did not disappoint. Cozy waiting area, spacious seating, Japanese-speaking staff, and punctual service. The food was amazing too: ramen broth (light) was just right. They offer kaedama (extra noodles) for less than a couple dollars. The appetizers are amazing. They also list the best selling items on the wall, if you need help deciding.",1
"Awesome Thai food selection, good price, friendly service & yummy.  Great lunch menu and delicious ginger tea.",1
Looks yummy . My girl tried coconut and liked it a lot  and I eat mango it was nice.i feel it's a little pricy but I guess the quality of the ice cream is worth it .Will be back soon to try more flavours.  They have a apricot as well,1
"Love this store. I'm presently remodeling two bathrooms. Not only do you have many choices for mosaics, tiles, travertine,, marble sticks, but free designer help. My wife and I worked with Karla Eschenbacher. She made the process easy, very good at bathroom design, and fun to work with. You don't see folks spraying tile with water to see the true color, she did. I recommend this store not only for good pricing and choices but for free professional designer support. You won't find what I just mentioned at big box warehouses like Home Depot and Lowes.",1
Excellent gluten free crepes and the service is always great here. We eat here every time we come to Vegas since we discovered it a few months ago.,1
I should have left this review last year after the first time I used Paragon Glass! Cynthia is amazing with customer service and so friendly. I'm always taken care of right away and my windshield is replaced within 24 hrs ( some same day i believe if it's in stock) and I've never had a problem after install. I will always use her if I need one.,1
Great prices better than Lee's! Super knowledgeable not only in wine but spirits as well. Yes they really do mean more...lots more. Sign up for their emails so you get their coupons.,1
"Always good! I've been here multiple times. The quality and taste is consistent. I get the make your own sushi roll. Spicy tuna, avacado, cream cheese, mango, and teriyak sauce is my go to. It can be busy at lunch so I'd suggest coming before/after 12 if you are in a rush. I never leave hungry and you can't beat $8. Sign up for the rewards at checkout and get discounts",1
"Having tried and failed vaping once in 2013, I geared up again September 2015 with some sub ohm equipment and went on a juice hunt. I required dripper fuel that would propel me to flavor town on a thick white cloud. After struggling with some other local shops, most with premade or generic tasting juice, I accidentally stumbled into the best vapor shop in Las Vegas... Elephant Vapor 2.  I was immediately taken by the proverbial hand by Jessica, the master mix maker, who insisted I drop my doughnutted bakery drips for her fruity concoction called 'Crunchy Bunches'. A sweet cereal vape that has the Cap'n jealous. It's a tart strawberry bombshell of an all day vape and it has gotten me of the stink sticks for GOOD. Thank you, Jessica, for saving my life!The rest of the crew at EV2 is just as good, they will mix and build and get you set up right. Best of all, they make you feel welcome and important. As long as I'm vaping in Vegas, you can be sure I'll be coming to Elephant 'too'. This is what a vape shop is all about. Keep on vaping!",1
"Absolutely delicious! Kind of difficult to spot, they could work on better signage but the door was amazing. I recommend the meatball appetizer (my friend loves the corn) and the chicken taco + the calamari were really good Staff is really sweet, and their recommendations are great",1
"This is seriously the ONLY place I would ever go to for a manicure or a pedicure.  They stress how they sterilize their tools which is a very big deal.  Many places don't or they simply wipe tools down with alcohol (which really isn't a thorough job of getting things clean).  In fact, one of my good friends ended up with a bad infection from another nail salon.  When she went to the doctor, he said he sees these cases all the time.  He actually told my friend to stop getting pedicures, because infections are way too prevalent.Not only is Luxy Nail Salon hygienic, beautiful and welcoming, they also have amazing customer service.  Queena was such an incredible sweetheart.  I would definitely see her again.  Today I got the Delux Moisturizing Pedicure.  AMAZING!She did my color with the UV gel nail polish.  That always lasts a long time!  But on top of that she did a scrub, hot stone massage, moisturizing mask that was then wrapped and put in heating booties.  It was so relaxing, I almost fell asleep.  She finished with a lotion application.I love this place and can't wait to get pampered again!  Please check them out and I also recommend making appointments.  They truly want to give you amazing service :o)",1
Amazing service and sure quick! I have no complaints I'll definitely be calling again.,1
"Steve from Red Truck handyman is the most knowledgeable, professional handyman I've ever met! We hired him to cut a hole in our wall under our stairs, and make a dog kennel out of it. Not only did he finish the job in two days,(by himself) he went out of his way to make sure my Wife and I were happy with his work. His prices were very reasonable, he has a lot of knowledge, and an A+ personality! He was always on time, and always responded to my phone calls, and texts.I am DEFINITELY hiring him again for our next project. If you hire him to do a job you won't regret it.",1
This place is great. Had a delicious rice bowl with red chile and beef. The beef was spicy and juicy giving the rice a really intense flavor. The customer service was amazing. They will make sure you are taken care of.  This is a awesome little place to sit outside and chill.,1
"This is my favorite Star Bucks, we go here on Saturday or Sunday mornings around 9 am. We always use the drive thru because I'm a super lazy bunny! :P The staff is always really nice and the service is as quick as you would expect a busy drive thru to be. Then we go and park by the soccer fields to watch the birds and other animals determine their pecking order. Plus I love using the Star Bucks App, FTW electronic money!Our order is pretty much always:Me:Turkey Bacon SandwichGrande Pike's Place with CreamBabe:Bacon Gouda SandwichGrande Hazelnut Latte 3 Pumps + Extra Shot",1
"In my gluttonous version of heaven, this buffet will be there.  Without the wait.  Without the other people (unless I am in the mood for people-watching, and there was certainly ample opportunity).Expect at least a 30-minute wait.  At the end of the wait, however, there are foot-long crab legs split in half with clarified butter in a tap (!), prime rib, jumbo shrimp, creme brulee, smoked duck, artichoke salad with tomato confit, charcuterie, cheese, scallop ceviche, and other ridiculously good offerings.$35 for a buffet is steep, yes, but I'd say it's worth trying at least once, if not at least once-per-trip.  As my +1 rightfully pointed out, I've paid $35 for meals where I didn't get full.  I walked out of this buffet wishing I had more room in my stomach...or a 20-pound-doggie bag.",1
"So much fun, great energy and Shannon was so grwat. Super nice and fun. Coming back to try the food, menu looked awesome",1
This place is wonderful especially during the winter time. Especially when it comes to dealing with wedding photography. If you love the outdoors but cant afford to pay the prices during the wedding season then you can just shoot inside Allan Gardens and it will look just the same if not better.,1
"A busy place, but they bus the tables promptly and have excellent service, so the wait times are short.  Staff is very friendly.  I have been here several times and ordered several of the hamburgers.  They have all been excellent.  Prices on the various burgers vary from $9.99 to $12.99 and this is the general range for most of the breakfast lunch and dinner entrees (breakfast served any time).  The burgers are a half pound  and they are GOOD QUALITY MEAT.  They are not greasy messes (which causes the buns to become soggy).  They come with a wide assortment of sides from fries to mac and cheese to fresh fruit and several other items.  This is a far better burger than some of the big name burger joints on the strip that are twice as expensive.  Haven't tried breakfast yet, but I look forward to it!  Clean, friendly, excellent food, fast service, that's 5 stars in my book!",1
Absolutely authentic Chinese food. Totally underrated on Yelp. Reminds me of home. Highly recommended!,1
"Cristina and her team are amazing. They are knowledgeable, technically savvy and easy to work with. With them on board I can focus on running the business and not crunching the numbers. I would definitely recommend them.",1
"Employee was very knowledgeable, My friends and I bought some shatter and we weren't tryna ball on a dab rig bc that shits expensive. U know how it be lmaoooo. We thought we were gonna have to smoke it out a crack pipe for a sec but the employee here told us about another dab tool. It was great cause we Didn't have to buy a crack pipe tonight. Thank u god bless",1
"Love this spot!I've eaten here numerous times and I never can complain.I went here most recently for my birthday with about 15 people, and they accomidated us so well! Our server Devin was so patient with our table and he made sure everyone's order came out correctly. I feel like we ate so much food.. from the wings... sliders... bone in filet... adult mac n cheese... scallops... and about every dessert they had! My favorite are their wings, a little spicey and so amazing!! Every steak I have ever had here has always been cooked to perfection... but the bone in is my favorite!! If you don't order the mac n cheese you are missing out... they fry it like a fishstick and serve it with a truffled cheese dipping sauce! OMG and the warm doughnuts are insane!! The vibe of this place is FUN, ENERGETIC, and TRENDY! I just love coming here before heading over to the Bank nightclub right next door! Makes life easy with a larger party! If you want a little more relaxed environment come earlier in the night around 5:00 when there are less people. As for price its worth every dime! The apps are not overpowering and thats why they are apps, not meals, and the steaks and sides are nice and oversized! Don't come here with a tight wallet, because you want to be able to fully enjoy the menu! Plus its in the Bellagio....so you know how that goes.. :)This place is just one of my favorites, and make sure to make a reservation because this place is always booked :)",1
"Our first visit, what a great breakfast! My son had the build your own omelette and proceeded to order everything you can get on it. The wife had the two egg breakfast and myself, the biscuits and gravy. We were all full and I was the only one to bring anything home. The gravy looks ""non-traditional"" when you think of sausage gravy but it was very good. It's refreshing to eat a breakfast where everything is home made. The coffee was great too. Friendly staff and such a good cause :-)",1
"Butterfly Wonderland, WONDER NO MORE FOLKS!!!! Holy shit, these things aren't moths! I didn't know they were different but now I do! Also, butterflies aren't born with wings?? WTF. Caterpillar. Chrysalis. Caccoon. Butterfly.Did you know Monarchs can migrate up to 1200 kilometers. For those of you using the metric system, that's 1.2 million meters. 5 out of 5 would recommend.",1
"This place is amazing from the service to the food. I experienced a wonderful menu prepared by Tyra (director of marketing) and had some of the best service from our server, Isaac. I work in the hospitality industry and sometimes a can be a tough critic, but no complaints here! The Cowboy rib steak was delicious and I didn't even know where to start with all the sauce options! The tuna tartare was also excellent :) This is definitely a place I am going to be sure to share with my friends & family.",1
"Not only is this the best steak dinner in the city but perhaps the greatest dining experience I've ever had.When we arrived, they took our coats and both hosts said happy anniversary to us.  They took us to our seats, immediately brought us complimentary champagne and the THREE people waiting on us that night all said happy anniversary to us.Our main server was a true gentlemen and easily took a good full 5 to 10 minutes explaining everything in the menu.  He made a point to say it would be best to order one steak and one or two sides to share but we were gluttonous fools on our anniversary so we ignored him.We started with the best caesar salad I've ever had, made right at our table.  Even this guy said Happy Anniversary to us before telling us all the ingrediants he was adding.  $16 for a salad for the table, so the two of us shared what ended up being a big salad.My fiancee ordered a really nice rib eye that she liked, I ordered the most expensive steak on the menu which was from a Japanese farm.  I've heard the expression ""this meat will melt in your mouth"" but until I had this steak, I've never before experienced this phenomenon.Our sides were mushrooms (which there was tons left over), double cooked fries in duck fat and the steaks themselves came with various salts and dips.  The only thing we regretted ordering were the fries, not because they weren't good but we didn't really need them and they didn't blend with the flavours of everything else very well.The combo of my steak, mushrooms and the rouqefort cheese they brought with the steak, was easily the greatest taste I've ever had in my mouth.We managed dessert, my fiancee had their homemade ice cream which was unreal.  I had a cheese plate with whiskey soaked cheddar.  On its own I wasn't crazy about it but when I added the honey they brought with the cheese, it was heaven.With drinks, a very generous tip and the most expensive steak on the menu, the bill was quite high (just shy of $400) but had we ordered as they suggested it would have been on par with a bill from Barberian's but this dinner and experience, as much as I love Barberian's, was sadly better than my best experience at Barberians by quite a margine.The combo of the unreal food, very nice people, attentive service and slick looking restaurant, I've yet to have a better dining experience in Toronto.",1
"We just finished lunch here for the fourth time.We have tried the Tri City Meat, the Meatball Marinara, and the Hawaiian.  They were all freshly made and fired, loaded with toppings, and delicious.On our last two trips, we have brought a bottle of wine, which they corked at the ridiculously low  price of $1 per person.  What a deal!Today, we noticed they had added ice cream to the menu, and only $1.50 per scoop.This is really some gourmet food, and they deal it out at fast food prices.  Take advantage of it now!Marshall has been there the past few times we have visited and I can't begin to express how great he is at customer service.  They truly seem to want you to be as comfortable and satisfied as possible.  Chris was working with  him today and was professional and courteous.The atmosphere is clean and tidy, and all of the condiments  you might want (including EVOO) are there for your convenience.I highly recommend this place for a snack, a meal, or even a party!",1
Love their tomahawk steak rib eye. And Charles is the best   To give you suggestions and what to try. Everything is delicious here. The clam chowder is the real deal full of clams and so creamy and the best in Arizona.,1
"This place is top notch and provides outstanding customer service. We just purchased my 10 year anniversary diamond ring from them. Not only is the ring absolutely perfect, but we had to take it back for a minor adjustment which they took care of the same morning. We love this place and won't go anywhere else. You shouldn't either.",1
"The staff is always friendly, helpful,& very efficient! I order arrangements at this location & they always are delivered as promised! Of course everything is delicious & beautifully arranged! A sweet Thanks to everyone who works at this Gilbert, Az store! Janie",1
"The tacos are really amazing. I had the spicy octopus, lucas, and the marlin tacos. They are actually pretty large tacos, so I could have just done 2 and been fine for lunch. I got the tacos to go, and by the time I got home they were falling apart on me. I think next time I'll eat them there to see if that makes a difference.",1
One of my favorite places. I've never had something I didn't love. My go to is the arrachera. I've waited in line 90 minutes before and still thought it was worth it. Line tip - try early on a week day. Or call ahead and get take out.,1
You guys are just awesome!! Thanks for the little half and half boundry on my pizza!! Such great pizza!,1
"My first time here at this place, anyway it is the perfect place to catch a good breakfast. The prices are really reasonable and the food is really good as well; so its like both a winning situation, because you get good food that doesn't break your bank. The ambiance is really urban and nice I advise you arrive at like at 9:15 because after that it is quite busy and good luck trying to get a table with a group of friends. Oh also the servers are really nice while I was wanting for my food one server came by to give me fresh granola very nice of him.",1
"This Chiropractor is inside Mountainside Fitness.  Dr. Roybal was really great in treating my 16 yr old son who had been having back pain and muscle spasms.  Great bedside manner, took his time treating my son, worked with my insurance and budget, educated my son on his problems and treatments.  I've been to many chiropractors and this doctor has been the best so far.  I saw him do some adjustments that I had never seen before.",1
"It's Bojangles aka the Catalina Wine Mixer, what more needs to be said. This place is fucking awesome and the cure for any hangover. 4 pc supreme combo FTW. The sweet tea is the nectar of the gods, and if you don't like the seasoning on the fries you should probably check your pulse.",1
What a great family owned hidden gem! Pizza crust is good. You can tell it's a real pizza shop when they have one of those huge ovens with the two doors.,1
"We've gone back several times now & have never been disappointed. Simply one of the best restaurants in Montreal. Go here, you'll love it. But it's pricey!!",1
I really enjoyed this place.  My boyfriend and I split a Breakfast Magic and the Funky Monkey.  Waffles were awesome.  I really enjoyed the tri-colord side of potatoes they have.  It was also a plus that it was Monday and the breakfast magic was only $4! Their home made bourbon syrup was also delicious.  Would def recommend this place to a friend.,1
"Best vegetarian Chinese in Toronto, maybe on the planet. And the worst-kept secret. After an Asian friend tipped me off about this place, I asked around and found that almost e every Asian in Toronto knows about it. It is run by monks. it is a wonderfully furnished restaurant with great staff and great service. They use only the simplest ingredients. Their challenge is to prepare tasty dishes from healthy ingredients and they met the challenge. Their two types of congee are the best in Toronto and addictive. The fried Lotus cake is better than a hambuger. The Singapiore Turnip is to die for. Ditto the spring rolls. Ditto the whole menu. Best value is lunch from the Dim Sum menu which actually has a lot more dishes than just  Dim Sum. Super value if you arrive before 12, they discount most of the Dim Sum, which is already a bargain. Happy happy joy joy.",1
"We have tried just about everything on the menu and the food has always been exceptional.  The food is always fresh and has a ton of flavor. The service is great, very friendly staff. Our kids love this place too so it makes it an easy choice for us.",1
Great beers.  Friendly staff. Low key atmosphere. Great music.  New friendship made. What else on the planet could one ask for. Come here and lift a pint or three. It will become one if your favorite places too.,1
The food was delicious with lots of flavor. I highly recommend the daily catch and the fish spring rolls. The cocktails are a must if you visit. The mixologist can recommend libations based on palate.,1
I forgot the guy who did my inks name. But he was clean and professional and had a cool personality. I really like the way he worked. I have 15 pieces of artwork. And the one he did for me is my 1st or 2nd favorite piece.,1
"If there is such a thing as Karma, Raul--with Rooter Ranger--will be leading a charmed life. Suddenly we were without hot water. Raul helped us find out if our warranty was still good (which it was) and then made three visits, including a Saturday, to locate the elusive problem. He was able to locate the problem as an electrical one. Because it was not a plumbing problem, he said it was no charge! You heard right--no charge. You can bet that we will be taking all our future plumbing problems to him and recommending him to all our friends. Thank you, Raul for your honesty and expertise!!!!",1
The Coffee Shop consistently deserves 5 stars. Anyone who says otherwise is a foo'.,1
"I stumbled on Stacks while in Matthews for another appointment. I only ordered food to go but the hostess was very kind and helpful. I noticed most people weren't waiting long before they were called to be seated as well. So that's a major plus if you do sit down. I got the basic French toast short stack....OMG....this is the best French toast I have ever tasted. I also had the south of the border omelette and it was delicious as well. The food is great and from my wait for the food, the staff was awesome too.",1
"Damn, this place is good. Two entrees with soda and tip = $29. We brought home two containers. Some of the best food in Madison.",1
"I am updating my previous review. You know it's great how the service has changed! It use to be that I would only go to Rosita once a year because I didn't care for the service over the years. Since then I have been back on a number of occasions and the service was great! The food was always great and now the service matches! My rating would be 5 stars for food always, and now 5 stars for service! It's a great place to be!",1
"Their macarons have a thicker filling in the middle than most other macrons, and I love this. It gives a really smooth and creamy texture, and makes their macarons super flavourful. Whichever macaron flavour you choose, you are sure to taste that flavour (you will really taste the earl grey in their earl grey macarons, and taste the cream cheese in their red velvet macarons).",1
If you are visiting Toronto you MUST go here!! I love the views during the day and night. It is also very beautiful at night because it lights up in bright colours. On certain days like Canada day it goes red and white and every 10 minutes there is a light show. I also like the gift shop which is a great spot to pick up souvenirs.,1
I had so much fun painting for the first time!  Donna is so sweet and helpful!  This is such a fun activity to do with friends or with a date.  I would definitely do this again!,1
"Good food. Had to think for a while with all the different tastes I was dreaming of from the menu. Ended up with the Italian sandwich. Others had pizzas and the rest, salads. All were in agreement that the food was great. We sat outside as it was a beautiful day.",1
"My daughter and I love this restaurant and we're not even close to being German. LOL.  Our waitperson, Annette, was wonderful. I tried a different dish today and didn't like it (not used to some German foods I guess) although I did like the sides. Long story short, the manager did not charge me for my entree.  I did not ask him to do that. We had the apple streusel with ice cream for dessert. It is to die for. We love the sausage appetizer.  We will definitely return. Great atmosphere too.",1
"Nice, big portions! My order is always correct. I've been a customer for 14 years. Try the Singapore mei fun.",1
Their carne asada burrito is the best burrito I've ever had. I can't recommend this place highly enough. I will be back.,1
"My go-to is the smoky chicken bowl. Very light, but with enough flavor and protein to hold you over. I also recommend the curry sweet potato soup.",1
"I needed someone to help and Matt Mertz Plumbing was there! I'm a retired coal guy with an invalid wife. We needed her spare walker from the basement and when I went to get it, I found the mess. My sewer had backed up into the basement. Word of mouth travels fast, and when I was told by my son and a few friends that Mertz was the best, I called. Their technician arrived at the agreed upon time and took care of the problem. The tech was skilled in his profession, was very friendly, and wasted no time. Now I'm one of those who says Matt Mertz Plumbing is the best!!!!!",1
"This company was wonderful.  I booked 2 movers, and 3 arrived  I was not charged for the third guy, so I essentially got one mover for free.  They were very professional and clearly explained all the charges up front.  The charges/fees explained on the phone when I made the appointment were the same as what the movers told me when they arrived.  Nothing hidden or deceptive at all.  They worked quickly, but not so quick that they risked damaging my belongings.  They properly protected my leather couches, and wrapped my dressers in cellophane to keep the drawers from opening.There are a lot of shady movers out there, and I strongly recommend Umbrella to get professional and fair service.",1
Don't miss the bacon cheddar biscuits!  Fish is always fresh and good. Bar/pub style ambiance is good. Parking either self or valet.,1
Finally they have opened ! Went in for an iced latte... they aren't on the menu... so the owner Stefan comes up and says he CAN make me one. However it isn't a traditional Italian drink... which then means this is an Actual ITALIAN coffee shop/gelato cafe. Well I tried the Italian version his suggestion. It was amazing. I'll be back to try the gelato soon. Looks amazing and apparently is made from scratch. Great atmosphere in there. Need more cafes like this in Vegas !,1
"I called Specialized Auto Glass on the recommendation of 4 other people. I figured with 4 recommendations these guys must be good. And they are! Their office staff is extremely professional and Clint was able to replace my cracked windshield in my 1991 Range Rover quickly and did a factory quality job and for a price I was extremely happy with since I wasn't using insurance. I highly recommend Clint and Specialized Auto Glass, not just to all Land Rover owners, but to anyone needing to replace their windshield.",1
"I love it here! Layca does my dip nails and pedicures! She's fast, professional, and does a wonderful job. Usually I jump around from behind ticklish on my feet but she's amazing and I'm totally relaxed. I won't go anywhere else!",1
"Secret Pizza is one of those establishments that really needs no introduction. At first glance, it is quiet, discrete, and no frills. Yet when you dig deeper and get to know its personality you find something so much more. I am a firm believer that every establishment has room for improvement. However, when I think about it long and hard Secret Pizza really epitomizes all I would want or come to expect of a pizza establishment. I almost dare say that it was the best pizza I have ever had. Nestled in the Cosmopolitan, you would think it would be flashy and glitzy. Rather, it defies that convention and it sits in a nondescript hallway that you would easily bypass. Not that I am saying you should go down every service hallway at the Cosmopolitan, I'm just saying taking the Star Trek like elevator to the third floor above the Chandelier Bar and walk down the nondescript hallway till you find Secret Pizza. Note, the hallway has photos on it to give you some direction.Once there, you will be greeted by the beautiful smell of pizza. While slices are available in the showcase, full pizza's are available as well. I'd probably call ahead if that is the case just to avoid having to wait. Since we didn't know any better, we settled on a simple pepperoni pizza. However as we waited to order, the guy working the counter clearly could tell we wanted a white pizza as well and mentioned that we could have a half pepperoni/half white pizza and it came out to be one of the best decisions we made in Vegas. The pepperoni was really good, but the white pizza was much better. Both offered really great flavors that melded in a perfect harmony that would make angels sing. The pepperoni has just the right amount of salt and spice to counteract the fat and sweetness of the mozzarella. While at the same time the white pizza was an amazingly good blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Both on a thin crust that was easy to work with, yet not being very greasy at all. Service was good with the staff clearly not only knowing their menu but also clearly having skill when it comes to making their pies. They keep the line moving at a carefully timed rate as if it were a well-made machine.Definitely a great place to grab a bite, while they may not have seating grab a glass of wine or beer with the pie and head on out to the main areas. It is definitely one bite you do not want to miss.",1
Spent all day shopping and ended up having lunch here- perfect place for a quick lunch!!Great service,1
"This was my first visit, pretty busy, but pretty awesome customer service, hostess had things pretty well organized, waitress was very pleasant.  Food was 5**, portions could have been bigger, but I didn't ""need"" it...    beer was cold, great atmosphere.   Highly recommended.",1
I love this place so much. Anytime I want a crepe cake this is where I go lol. It's a very small and intimate dessert Cafe. The prices are decent and the presentation on the dessert is always cute.,1
Great Margaritas -- enjoyed Taco Tuesday - worth the trip.,1
Friendly technicians and always keep me updated on their schedule. Also willing to address any specific issues if needed.,1
I had my first cleaning with his office a few weeks back and they did an excellent job.During the cleaning they found a couple of small cavities which they could have filled on the spot. (Very convenient) however I did have to work and it wasn't possible that day.I went back and had them take care of the fillings a week later.They did an excellent job with numbing me before the fillings. I didn't feel a thing from start to finish.Dr. Standley took his time and made sure the fillings were perfectly shaped for my biting action.Very friendly and efficient staff!,1
Arrived on a friday evening and luckily did not have to wait to be seated. The place was packed and i expected to be waiting for a table. Probably the best customer service ive had at a Korean restaurant. Food came out very quick and store owner came to greet each table. I ordered the naengmyeon noodles. I recommend getting the combo which comes with kalbi for $22. Chicken katsu portions were excellent however i didnt personally like the sauce it came with. Delicious cold noodles in a flavourful broth and will definitely be returning for authentic korean food.,1
"Oh my goodness! I don't even know where to start. Getting car repairs done is one of my biggest fears, as I always feel like I have a target on my back as a young girl who knows nothing about mechanics! I did some research and found this amazing place, and I am so glad! They squeezed me in the schedule last minute. I came in, got a free ride home, less then an hour later they called me to pick me up because my car was already finished! I had free rides each way and when I went to pay, Matt wouldn't let me! It was a quick fix and instead of making something up, they were 100% honest and said it really didn't cost them anything to fix.I've never been so impressed by the complete experience and costumer service at a car repair shop. I would recommend ANYONE!",1
"I get my brows done with Ripal and I love them every time. She's super gentle, and I never have bumps or irritation after getting them done with her. The place looks clean and smells like essential oils. The girls are very welcoming and the prices are reasonable. I recommend this place to everyone I know.",1
"We love Hilgers. The staff is always friendly and patient with the little ones that come in here, including my two boys. The dentist can be intimidating for children; however, Hilgers makes it a fun environment with their video games and token prizes for the kiddos when they are done. We love Dr. Kelly and Dr. Cole. Dr. Kelly has returned a phone call on a weekend regarding some concerns we had with my son after a procedure. I sent her pictures and she was quick to respond and reassure any concerns I had. Dr. Cole has done work on one of my sons in the office and has made sure to assure both of us during the procedure.  These dentists are professional and informative. I never feel ""up-selled,"" rather educated on how to care for our little guys teeth. Thank you guys for being awesome. Oh, and never worry about forgetting ur kiddos appts. They text, email and physically call. We will recommend over and over. If you are looking for a pediatric dentist...Hilgers should be your choice. Also, know they are present in the community...we see them during the Litchfield Park Easter Celebration. Check them out!",1
"Love the food, the location, the ambience. Best pizza evs! I really love this place so I'm going to round up my 4.5. This place is super fast-paced, so don't expect attentive service. Also I think the service used to be better but was lacking the last few times I was there, that's why I took off the 0.5. Super chic place in the midst of Yorkville. The decor has a lot of character even though it's a bit cramped inside. It's not a really big place and you really don't get a lot of privacy because the next table is just literally a breath away from you. However, during nice weather the patio and roof patio should be opened. I love everything here. Pizza's great, super thin chewy crust, tasty sauce, delicious ingredients whether it is spicy sausauge, proscuitto, fresh basil or arugula, combined with flavourful cheeses. It's Italian goodness rolled into a thin sheet. I haven't tried too many of the other entrees. Pasta is good and fresh. Tried the ceasar salad, it's a bit on the small side for sure, but still very tasty, Bruschetta is just okay for me, not enough flavour. However, the oven-baked Asiago served with crostinis is divine!So far, one of the best Italian restaurants in town. I love coming back here when I'm in the area. A nice weekend would be Nervosa plus a massage in one of the nearby spas. But it does get pretty busy on the weekend. Not really sure about reservations etc. But it just seems like you will just have to wait during busy times. I need to come back to try more of their other dishes when I'm not just craving pizza!",1
"I have been going to Clear Vision for over 15 years. They are the best!!  Dr. Crutchfield, Dr. Fermin. Can't get much better than these guys..The staff is great and I can't say enough about Rhonda when it comes to helping you select and get fitted for the right pair of glasses etc.. Patient Care is absolutely their # 1 priority. No matter what state I happen to be in, I always fly back to Vegas for my eye care with the Clear Vision Team on West Sahara.",1
"I went here for maybe the second time tonight and, I gotta say, I loved it. There are a decent amount of bowling lanes all lit up, a restaurant, two bars, laser tag and an escape room coming Feb 2018. The kids I went with loved all the arcade game varieties and the laser tag was reasonably priced. I've come here before to do bowling at night with my friends and loved it as well. If I had the choice of coming here again, I'd do it in a heartbeat.",1
"Toujours aussi bon. Les spéciaux du jour sur l'ardoise sont à chaque fois incroyablement frais.  Le Blue Fin, le maquereau, l'ottoro et le toro fondent en bouche.Le proprio est très attentionné et on le sent vraiment au niveau de sa cuisine tout comme le suivi qu'il apporte après le repas.",1
"We were quite impressed with this place...it was worth the wait.  We tried to go in two weekends ago and were a little annoyed to see the place sitting closed - luckily there was a lady outside (waiting for her friend) who told us it was amazing and worth coming back, so we planned to....and later I found out the owners had gotten married that day so I couldn't be too mad! :) We went back the next weekend, and got their Zoodle Pad Thai and 'No Mac' & Cheese - both were just simply, amazing - so tasty and I didn't feel disgusting after completely inhaling my meal!  The 'No Mac' & Cheese tasted like the real thing.  We will be going back to eat our way around the menu, for sure!  It's really nice to have a place to go that focuses on healthy options.",1
"This is the best pho for such a great price! I love the spicy tamarind broth. The other crazy thing is they have live music and karaoke and such things, making it a very unique pho joint! Shoutout to Lucas who took care of us today. Today was my third time. And my first time being taken care of by Lucas. He was super attentive and knowledgeable about the menu! He was just all around a genuinely awesome and gave fantastic rare service. Cheers!",1
"Amazing, especially for the East Valley. Their coffee has always been great - and they're one of the few places I've found that has butterscotch syrup! Butterscotch iced lattes are dreamy...The Field Veggie sandwich is equally delicious. And their cupcakes are always dependably yummy - I tried the coffee and cigarettes one when they had it...so strange, but really good!A really good find in the sea of Starbucks stores that is Gilbert.Awesome atmosphere, too!",1
"We came here for lunch right before we drove back to LA.  I always like homemade udon, I had a great experience of fresh udon in Oahu, Hawaii and have been craving for it. So, when I saw the sign ""homemade udon"" while driving along Spring Mountain Rd, I knew we have to stop here for lunch.  So, we order the followings:Takoyaki: Maybe it was served hot (sizzling hot), it was the best takoyaki I have ever eaten. The fried batter was literally melted in my mouth and the octopus was just the right amount of chewy.Curry Udon: My husband ordered this one and he loved it.  I tried a little taste.  Curry is the typical japanese curry, not too strong.Beef Udon: My mother-in-law ordered this.  I didn't try it. She said the soup was too oily due to the fatty beef (beef brisket) and kinda bland.  But she loved the udon.  So, not as perfect.Seafood tomato cream udon and Sea Urchin cream udon: my daughter and I shared these two because we couldn't decided which one to get.  Both are very tasty. If you love uni (sea urchin), you will love the sea urchin one.  I have to say, these two are the best on the menu.Miso Carbonara Udon and mini Ikura (salmon egg) rice bowl: my 6ft tall boy ordered this. He loved the miso carbonara, he said it reminded him of cream of corn, but on the heavier side. He said the salmon eggs were very fresh.  He barely finished the whole thing.All in all, this is one great noodle place if you love udon.  If you haven't tried fresh udon, then you have to give this place a try. The place isn't big.  We arrived 5 min before opening so we got seated right away. But in no time, the place was full.  So, I advised you to go early.  Services were great. The kitchen is open and you can see a young man making fresh udon right in front of you. We will visit this place again when we go to Vegas next time.",1
"Visited Madison for just 5 days and came here for bagels in three different occasions. BEST BAGELS EVER! Handrolled, freshly made, DELICIOUS. So many options to choose from. And that pastrami... Oh that pastrami!",1
I've only visited Las Vegas twice but The Venetian is amazing! Not only is it beautiful; the staff goes above and beyond to make their guests feel welcome and incredibly comfortable. The Venetian is also cost effective and had I just looked for the most cost effective hotels on The Strip...I would have assumed that it would be much more expensive than most of the hotels on The Strip.We will be returning to Vegas in October for my husband's business trip. Because his convention is at the Mandalay Bay; we will be staying there and I'll have the opportunity to compare hotels. I'm looking very forward to that trip and I will most definitely write a review about the Mandalay Bay.,1
"A rarity on the Las Vegas Strip, good food.  This is family style dining.  Portions are huge.  Ate here with a party of 14 and never had to wait for drinks, the appetizers were very good, and the main courses were fantastic.  Both the lasagna and chicken parm were very good.  It ain't cheap but it is great for large groups.  We sat for 3 hours enjoying a meal and company.",1
Got my lashes done for the very first time ever !! My experience at lash lounge from beginning to end was outstanding and all the ladies are very professional and welcoming.   Lexi was my lash stylist and she was amazing!!!! I'm definitely coming back to her for a fillThanks girl ;),1
"Dinner with my roommate! Listen, we walked in as the last reservation till close and despite our timing the employees of Mesa were so warm and greeted us with enthusiasm. Our server Brenda was amazing and let me tell you why - i have a nut allergy and after advising this to Brenda she made sure to back track on any items that i ordered just to advise that she could make a separate bread basket (complimentary of Mesa) or that i shouldn't order a particular item. She really took the time to take care of me. Also, her knowledge of the menu items and what ingredients are included in each entree really impressed me, i was most grateful to her.We ordered the steak, pork loins, and the mahi and i can honestly admit each entree tasted amazing. The chef deserved a round or two for an outstanding job.Cheers!",1
I absolutely LOVE this coffee shop. The owners take pride in ensuring a quality cup of joe! All organic... This is my favorite coffee shop in Las Vegas. I will no longer find myself at another Starbucks when visiting Vegas ever again. Kudos!,1
"This is the place to be for recreational and competitive gymnastics! The facility is large, bright and very well taken care of. The staff is knowledgable, friendly and motivated. Multiple times throughout the year they host free events for friends and family to come together, including open gym and national gymnastics day (very fun!). My preschooler has a blast and is a learning so much more than gymnastics. Would recommend this facility to ANYONE!",1
"This place is amazing. Every single thing that has entered my mouth is delicious. Wow. I feel like I'm in a different city. The jazz band playing in the background is off the chain, the food is beyond yum, the ambience is perfect. Nice job!!! I'll be back.",1
"I had the pleasure of experiencing Off Da Hook during its first week of business at the new Glendale Avenue location. Without a doubt this is THE BEST soul food restaurant in Phoenix!  You first notice the cleanliness of the establishment upon entering. Not your typical hole in the wall joint that you expect. Nice large booths, tile floor, bright colors, and that oh so sweet aroma of soul food ! I experienced soul food at its best. I concur with another reviewer that Off Da Hook by far exceeds Lolo's Chicken and Waffles.The serving sizes are HUGE so go with appetites ready to be satisfied with all the traditional eats we are familiar with.  Prices are extremely reasonable, service was fast, and staff was very friendly.Glad to finally have a place to call home for good soul food in the valley.",1
Seriously always get the best pedicure here! Love this place!!!,1
",      .  ,        .   ,   .     .  .    ,  .  OMG I just regret to eat poutine at the old montreal area which somebody recommend at a travel book. It was so expensive and they served normal fries which is same with Mcdonald's french fries. And I paid $18 included tips. And I was disappointed about poutine. But I just change mind. It was good poutine I ate at 5am this restaurant. I just stop by montreal to go to mont-tremblant. I serched yelp then I found here. It was good and  I will recommend to my homies.",1
"friendly professional explained process over delivered (car was ready early) communicated updates daily went the extra mile Over and above expectation - I was able to pick up and drop off my enterprise rental at their location. I don't ever want to be in another accident but, If I am - I'll come back here.  My friends were right, Gerber Collision was the best place to take your car for collision repair!  Come to think of it - I'llProbably just bring my car in for glass whenever needed.  Their customer service is exceptional!Thanks so much to Brian Kelly, from Gerber Collision who let me know what to expect kept me informed and answered any questions I had along the way. My vehicle had rear end damage. And Brian even did me a solid and refilled my windshield washer fluid!! And a shout out to Geico (the other persons insurance) who was helpful, made sure I was okay personally, and then made all the appointments and scheduled the rental car and everything very quickly.  My initial concerns after the accident was the very clear understanding that I had no idea what to do or who to call first.  Turns out, Geico just handled everything for me.",1
"I can't say enough good things about my experience buying a home with Rebecca at GEO Real Estate. My wife and I are first time home buyers and felt informed, guided, and supported through our journey of purchasing our first home. I truly felt like Rebecca took care of us like we were family. She worked hard to fulfill all of our requests and would not accept less than what we were promised by the seller. She was prompt and always checked in even when there wasn't any activity. She got us all the paperwork with no delay and ensured that we would close by the date we needed to close. I can honestly say that we would have not had the most stress free experience possible if we had gone with another realtor. If you want to be sure that your realtor has your best interest and puts your needs first, I highly recommend Rebecca at GEO Real Estate.",1
"Very good food and real nice service. I've had a great poke bowl, spam musubi, and teriyaki steak plate - which is a total score to find all at one restaurant in Arizona. The teriyaki steak plate is a lovely dinner. Pretty nice pricing too. Thanks Pokedon!",1
"Spent a week there on business. Like others, the bar, pools, Spa, and staff were all amazing. Got a deal on Priceline too, so it was easier on the wallet.Great place, if you have to be in PHX, its worth the drive to Gainey Ranch in Scottsdale.",1
"Good stuff here. Don't tell your friends - it will get to crowded and the it will be a Yogi Berra issue. ""Nobody goes there, it's too crowded""",1
"I saw the Elvis tribute show in November 2015, and we both had a fantastic time, and really enjoyed the show.The show is located at the V Theater at Planet Hollywood.  The V Theater is a small theater and I didn't see any bad seats.  They all seemed good.   The show last a little over 1 hour, and is a high energy performance.The performer was incredible, looked, moved, and acted just like the real Elvis.  He is a great impersonator.  He covered all of the Elvis hits perfectly.  The band rocked.There is one costume change half way through the show, and a very nice veteran tribute.After the show, the performer will take a photo with you for no charge.Adults drinks are for purchase, cocktails are $16, beer $8 per drink.This is a really fun show and a great way to spend some time in Vegas.  I wish the show was a little longer.",1
"I'm not much of a Caribbean eater but the food here is top notch. I really enjoy their jerk chicken and also their plantain poutine. It's really worth stopping by here. The plantains are cooked to a perfect level, velvety.It's a very small place, and if you come for lunch during the weekday you will be fighting to get a seat because Ubisoft is right at the corner and everyone goes there. But, if you're passing by, it's worth the wait or get it to go.They also have sauces and little containers for you to take with you. When I went there was a spicy red sauce, a sweet orange one, and an interesting maroon sauce that tasted kind of like a combination. I suggest trying all 3!I've also been told that the oxtail is phenomenal too.",1
left the yelp event and wandered east.. after my coffee craving was fulfilled at Timmys D' and i took a turn into my favorite mexi-indian fusion restaurant.there is something magical in the almost snail like pace that the non smiling chef behind the counter brings to the food.my favorite treat here is the mixed vegetable california roll with medium spice... the california roll here is not even related to its sushi counterpart... it is a grilled burrito style roll with Indian spiced roots..mmm for $4.95 and the option to buy mango nectar its a hidden gem... the grease and old photos of new york with the twin towers add to the charm..try and get the chef to smile..,1
I can't say enough about how helpful and insightful my experience with SL Computers was !!! I had my desktop repaired and serviced there recently and the experience was straightforward and without the upsell pitch. My repair was done in a timely manner and I received nothing but professionalism and well established knowledge from them.I STRONGLY recommend them for ALL your computer needs !!!I would not hesitate to use them again.,1
"Just like how I remebered!! I use to go to Fatburger all the time, so when I heard they're going to open one up here in Cave Creek, I had to make the drive!! Going to continue to make ""trips"" from Chandler now that Fatburger is back in town. I got to meet the manager Steve, great guy and good vibes, seemed to really care about my experience and the quality. Maybe next time, I'll try the wings and the sweet potato fries!",1
"What a great place!  There's a great, modern, fresh vibe. Massage, hair, makeup.Located in Fort Mill off Gold Hill in a new plaza, just past QT on the left. The staff was very friendly and our hair appt. was affordable. We will definitely be back.",1
"I told myself I wasn't gonna collect Funko Pop figures but my best friend Kyle is to blame. He got me my 1st set last xmas. I went into Wii Play Games and I found all but one figure to complete my Overwatch collection. The clerk was extremely helpful and even checked in the back for ones I couldn't find on the floor. I was able to get the ones I needed and for a decent price. I even picked up some plastic holders to keep my boxes looking nice. This is where the madness begins but at least I know that if I need to find certain characters this is a good spot to do so. I would definitely recommend this place and not just for your Funko needs but all types of board, card and video games. This is a true one stop shop for all your gaming and collecting needs.",1
I went here looking for late night grub on New Years Eve 2015 I didn't expect much being that this was a bar but I was totally surprised the food was delicious I ordered this fried fish tacos with a side of sweet potatoes fries which was excellent and perfectly portioned . On top of that my server was awesome ! He was kind and you could tell he liked his job it doesn't get better than that!!,1
Stopped here for lunch. Conveniently located next to the motorcycle shop we were just at. Food was good. Ordered a BLT and a Patty Melt. On Fridays they include a fresh baked cookie with your order. Casual place. Will definitely come back. We here the breakfast here is good too.,1
"A great lively place in a under renovation part of downtown. When you get here, there are little indications on where you should line up, how to order etc. This contributes to the feeling of freedom. You have a large choice of tables and type of seating, while the floor plan contributes to feeling as a member of the community. So what about the food?Excellent. Flavored, prepared as requested, well presented without feeling outrageously elaborated. Simple, balanced and good. What about the coffee?I took the pour over, which is a free refill, super hot, but not bitter, not too sweet just right. Again a great place to take a breakfast, and a break in general. Feeling rested, connected and ready to go, is what a breakfast should make you feel. Go for it!!",1
We had a big group in our family of 13. The food is fabulous and the service was very good. Must have is the Calamari and the Chilean Bass. We will be back again for sure.,1
"Tyler our server was really nice, for starters. Wasn't looking for a huge lunch - just something simple. Wife hat the house chop salad with BBQ chicken and avocado dressing. I had the brisket sandwich and fries. Both entrees were fantastic. Wish we were there for dinner sometime, but traveling. We'll definitely return someday on our next visit. Kudos to your well managed restaurant and awesome food! Stop here Yelpers!",1
"Having a wheat allergy, when I walked up to the counter and saw the assembly line, I started to panic a little. I told the person at the start of the line (Ryan) that I had a wheat allergy and he immediately took off his gloves and asked me to head toward the register. He asked me to circle what I wanted on the menu and told me he would take care of me and be the only one handling me food. He personally made my lunch and only took ingredients from the back cooler that hadn't been on the line yet. (Limiting any cross contamination) I was truly impressed with their knowledge of gluten free and cross contamination. The food was yummy and Ryan was amazing!! I will definitively be back!",1
"This location is AWSOME!! I am visiting Las Vegas for EDC and my car broke down. Auto zone recommended this place and I am so lucky I went. From the moment I walked in, Steve Duerler took care of me, EVERY step of the way. My alternator was bad and he took time to explain everything to me and was just such a great guy! The entire staff was friendly, energetic and just darn nice. Coming from a woman who has no idea about cars, this was such a pleasant surprise. I was scared and Steve just took every care he could offer.  Thank you Steve for making me feel confident in you and the staff. I am forever grateful.  Go Ohians!!!",1
"It was honestly amazing, the workers were kind and the food is good quality. I was completely satisfied.",1
"There are so many delicious options for brunch at this place. No matter what you order, it will come out fast, right, and always taste good. They are consistent every time, come in once a weekly, once a month, or once a year, and the food will always taste good. The staff is always friendly,  service top notch. The cocktails are strong and the espresso is very good. There is always a crowd, but the wait is minimal, and so worth it. The counter is truly the best spot.",1
"While still recovering from the sheer chaos that was EDC 2014, the GF and I decided to do some trendy window shopping, which inevitably led us over to Gucci. What I hadn't expected was to be exiting this boutique with a brand-new pair of sneakers - and some fond recollections of one of the more satisfying experiences that I've ever had with high-end shopping.All too often, many designer boutiques express an unwillingness to help customers who don't exhibit a certain look - unfortunately, while this ""cooler-than-you"" attitude can sometimes be subtle, sometimes it just isn't! Thankfully, the Via Bellagio Gucci doesn't suffer from this same drawback. My girlfriend and I were greeted almost instantly after walking in the store, and we were free to window shop as we pleased, not having to worry about salespeople tracing our steps like vultures circling over a fresh kill. After briefly taking a look at Gucci's menswear selection, I made my way to the shoe collection - where I had the immensely good fortune of stumbling upon a pair of nubuck and calfskin mid-tops. Conveniently enough, I had been eyeing these kicks for some time - having seen them at several department stores in and around the LA area.Even more conveniently, they were being offered at 50% off at this boutique! I guess it just happened to be my lucky day. I requested to try on my size from a very helpful sales associate (her name was either Blanca or Bianca, can't quite recall), who brought out two different sizes for me - and in two different colorways. After quickly learning that Gucci sizing doesn't bear all that much similarity to Vans sizing (goes to show what I know, I guess), Blanca brought out some additional sizes for me, and even helped lace the shoes up, as well - I know, I know, I'm helpless. With these adjustments, the items fit absolutely perfectly - but I still wasn't quite sure as to whether I'd be pulling the trigger just yet. I politely asked if I'd be able to fetch a pair of jeans out of my car in valet (as I had already begun forming some looks up in my mind), and the staff at Gucci obliged with no problem whatsoever. Having made a couple quick adjustments to my outfit just a couple of minutes later, I came back, tried on the shoes, and knew that I was sold. The entire process was seamless, easy, and refreshingly unpretentious. Checkout was similarly effortless (although I guess you can't really expect a line of customers to build up at a Gucci boutique), and I felt particularly badass strolling through the Bellagio casino with a new brown shopping bag in tow...a feeling which quickly died out after seeing a lady with massive LV shopping bags on both arms.All jokes aside, the overall level of quality with Vegas Gucci boutiques seems to be distinctly high (having recently had similar experiences at the Crystals branch). I'd gladly bring my business to this particular Gucci boutique in the future. *Tip:* This boutique doesn't have a changing room on-hand. While this may present a problem for female customers, I was thankfully given the opportunity to change my outfit in the back of the store - again, with no hassle at all!",1
"DENVER HAS FINALLY ARRIVED IN HOUSTON!As a Denver transplant I have been craving Snooze for years.  This location captures the spirit of the original Ballpark location, save for the missing mural outside and the below freezing temps.  No trip to Denver was complete without a stop at Snooze.The best way to start is with a pineapple upsidedown pancake as an appetizer and work your way through the menu as you visit weekly is not more often.  (You will want to be here daily.)Service is attentive door to door.  The typical new location hiccups seem to have been worked out during their soft opening events.Now in Houston I have a piece of home to share.",1
"This is La Prairie's best kept secret. A run down casse-croute attached to a once mobile trailer, Chez Monique seems to have perfected the poutine ""classique"". Open only during summers and expect lineups at lunch time.",1
Holy. Cow!! I've seen a ton of shows and they all were kind of the same...BUT NOT THIS ONE!!! Absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! The lady shooter?!?  The rolled skaters?!?! OMG!! This show had me on the edge of my seat and my heart was RACING!! My jaw stayed dropped and I almost had to cover my eyes for some stunts because they were so dangerously crazy!!! WOW!! SERIOUSLY WOW!!!,1
"Loved my visit to Hand and Stone Leaside. Staff very professional and welcoming:))) Services were great, spa was clean.Will definitely be returning:))",1
"beautiful space filled with one of a kind items. everything is placed with purpose, the interior is so thoughtfully designed and the selection is impeccably curated. i especially loved the candle holders, the modern oil lamps, and the tea and coffee serving sets - this store is filled with items that you will cherish and have for a lifetime. the owners were friendly and helpful and gave us suggestions for other places to visit in the city, which we really appreciated. since we were visiting from out of town, we found one special item that we really wanted but we are definitely looking forward to shopping from their online store in the future. mjolk is a toronto gem.",1
"J'ai eu un véritable coup de cœur pour ce petit commerce imitation marché à St-Henri. Il n'est pas tellement loin du métro, j'y suis allée par hasard, leur petite terrasse a suscité mon attention. La décoration est juste magnifique, le tableau noir où sont accrochés des paniers pour pouvoir faire ""son épicerie"" j'ai trouvé ça tellement mignon. On peut même venir acheter quelques citrons, ananas, pommes et oignons biologiques. Sur place, j'ai acheté un petit smoothie fraise/banane préparé sur place puis j'ai pu tranquillement finir des devoirs, assise sur le bar. Ils vendent également des petits jus pressés à froid et quelques ingrédients à rajouter dans ces smoothies pour la maison comme du chou Kale. J'y suis allée cet été, ils venaient de fêter leur 1 an, j'espère qu'ils garderont leur Joys of Living pour les prochaines années :)",1
I have been taking my dogs there for years. They are so sweet and caring. The school specifically tells you that these are groomers in training and if youwant a professional its by appointment only and it is a lot more. Everyone has to learn there job as a beginner so you have to be patient. They have always been great and affordable.,1
"OMG one of my co-workers sent me a picture of this and had to try it immediately after work. It's the Korean chicken fries with a chipotle and mayo sauce on top. You can get it with jalapeños but I asked for it on the side. It did not disappoint at all. It wa ms amazing! The Korean chicken had a good portion on the fries. The fries was hot and the sauces, everything went amazingly together. They were playing Hawaiian music, it was a nice local vibe, reminded me of back home in Hawaii. It was finger licking good. Would definitely come back!",1
"Great food, incredible service and a warm friendly atmosphere make this cafe an excellent spot for breakfast or lunch.",1
"Great experience.  The instructors were very careful and made sure it was a fun flight.  It's  $75 for a 3 minute flight, but you can get a discount flight for $44.99 with your Costco card from Costco online.  Would definitely recommend it.  My son is 13",1
"Excellent fish and hush puppies. Not overly heavy, good quality fish. Substantial serving. Very polite gentlemen behind the counter- two of them. Smiles and politeness. Very nice.",1
I love that this pool is never ever crowded.,1
Had a party of 14 for Thanksgiving. It was a great time thanks to our server Pam. She took our drinks as we sat down because we didn't all arrive together. Some people asked for substitutes and she had no problem with that. All and all the dinner was great but the service was exquisite. Thanks Pam for making my family Thanksgiving an unforgettable one.,1
"The Green Own in a word: FAKE.  Well, more succinctly: FAUX.  As a card-carrying meat-eater, I could eat here weekly and never miss that fat juicy real steak.  I don't particularly like Schnitzel, but the Green Owl Schnitzel is amazing!  Tonight I had the empanadas, which were fantastic in their own right, but the accompanying rice and beans, usually neglected add-ons, were unbelievable.  I could make a meal of that rice alone.  Relaxed, casual, up-beat atmosphere.  All in all, a great experience.  We will be back, no question.",1
"Had my first facial with Pan yesterday and 5 out of 5 stars is exactly what she deserves. Great products, calm and quiet atmosphere; it was just her and I. She uses the circle and point tool to do the extractions, which hurts like hell, but it definitely cleans your skin well. Don't be surprised if your skin is red for a few days. I know mine will be.She uses France Laure products which are high end, luxurious, great quality products.She's an esthetician of almost 20 years and it shows!Oh ya, her massage IS AMAZING!",1
"I am a healthcare professional, recently diagnosed with Lung Cancer and found that the usual Oncologist is good at treating symptoms but seems to have no insight/mindset to find/investigate the cause of the disease or how to treat with a natural approach.  To my great good fortune, I found Dr. Cheryl Kollin NMD, CCN!!.  She is a great listener, treats you as an individual vs a treatment plan that is a ""one size fits all"".  She is very supportive and not only provides clinical care but works to help you balance your terror, fear, feeling overwhelmed, depressed, etc - yes, all about balancing self to maximize treatment!  Beyond that, with solid clinical lab results, Dr. Kollin recognizes when the treatment needs adjustment/ changes and with her years of experience in a laboratory research setting and then coupled with years of clinical experience, rest assured, you are receiving THE BEST of CARE!!!  Dr. Kollin is a healer with a passion to change/improve the life of each of her patients!!!              PW            Phoenix, AZ",1
"This was such a treat! My first time at a Yelp event, I got to meet and spend time with fellow Yelpers, have a great time and talk about what we all love... FOOD! I would have never found this place on my own, so it was great to receive the invitation for Kaba Curry and get to enjoy their Japanese curried noodles. Surrounded by other food places, such as wing king (awesome as well), this place is ideal if you want to grab some very tasty food at very reasonable prices. Let's dig a bit more into the experience.The food was simply amazing. One of the sampled dishes was curried udon noodles and the taste of the sauce itself had a complex taste but was easily enjoyable. The first thing you will notice when you try their curry is the explosion of flavors in your mouth, and then you start to feel the subtle heat of the spices...a great flavor combination you will love.",1
"I signed up for one month of Bang's hybrid training program. Overall, a highly recommended experience!The context: I was super active in my 20's - crossfit, MMA gyms, and at-home training. I've since become quite a couch potato in recent years, and wanted to get back into training in a safe and sustainable way. I've had too many false starts where I would hop back into a strenuous regime and skip gym days because of extreme soreness or disappointment. The owner, Geoff, convinced me this was the right place.The good: A training paradise. Tons of the best gear, including hard-to-find things like battle ropes and a sled. Never having to fight for space to train. Super knowledgable staff that are just fun to be around. Fun and varied routines that got me back on track and feeling confident by the end of the month. Everything is clean, tidy, odour free.The bad: I can see cost being an issue for some people. I'd suggest talking to the staff to see what works best for your fitness goals.",1
"Interesting menu, wonderful ambiance, delicious food and deserts, topped with a good wine selection and outstanding service. Our server Ricky was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the menu and helped make a thoroughly enjoyable evening.",1
"Wow!  What a find!  A hidden gem on the back side of a pretty cool strip mall (yes, I DID just use those words in the same sentence).  This place is enormous, and it was packed mid-day mid-week.  There was even a video blogger doing some filming inside while I was there.  The patrons were young and old, including what appeared to be a group of about 12 having a business meeting in one area.  The vibe is cool, chic French, with lots of eclectic seating and decor.  The music is fitting but not obtrusive.  The pastry case is huge, and the simple chocolate croissant and latte I had were perfect.  My only wish is that they had more outdoor seating, and that is was shaded.  On a sunny day, this is the only thing they don't offer much of.  But, the inside...c'est vraiment magnifique!",1
Palermo's pizza reminds me of growing up many years ago in Detroit.  I haven't found pizza like this anywhere else in Glendale. I love it!,1
"I loved the salon and my stylist, Lacey. Everyone was very friendly. Lacey asked me what I was looking for and made sure I was happy with everything as she was going. She was very educational when it came to which products she was using. I never buy products at a salon, but she sold me on a few of them. I was very impressed. I'll definitely go back!",1
Bought my car in 2014 and the experience was one of the best for buying a car. I've also been taking it here for service and the people have been very friendly and courteous everytime.,1
"After reading reviews on Yelp, I took my 1995 Volvo to the shop.  Joel was a great mechanic and fixed my neutral safety switch and made me feel totally comfortable.  They seemed to be really busy all the time (a lot of cars being worked on!) but the two times I had to take my car in, I got it back really quickly.I really have nothing but good things to say about them!",1
Callled made apt confirmed by email and text job was done by Steven . He did outstanding job very professional and nice we hav made apt for water softener to be installed next month great company,1
"Always friendly with good service, as someone already said, truly a hidden gem.My 2nd visit comprised trying the daily lunch special.For $12.45 CAD, cream of mushroom soup (perfectly flavoured and heated), thick boneless pork chop with a pepper based zigeuner sauce, a bread based Tyrolean dumpling, and  fresh cooked vegetable medley.I have posted a picture this meal and a portion of their menu. I can vouch that the chicken schnitzel is so so good.So far, the portions are exactly the right size except I am always too full for dessert so my next trip will focus on dessert.The location is a little non-descript and hard to find if you are not looking but there are friendly people in the centre who will direct you to the restaurant. If memory serves, it has limited hours and unannounced closings. But, if you venture for lunch, you should be golden.Highly recommended for locals and tourists!",1
"I love this place, great decoration and good coffee. I don't get the negative reviews though, I think it's just a honest place doing honest business. I've been here for more than 5 times and I will continue to come.",1
One of my favorite go to places for great food at a great price.  So many favorites to choose from that we always try something new.  Never have been disappointed,1
"The Grind is a strong contender in the burger wars. I had to try the Sweet and Spicy burger after hearing about the candied jalapeños, and it was so good I ordered it during a return visit. My only problem with the burger is that it is, in the words of Tiny Elvis, ""huge"". In order to feel halfway human after eating here, I really ought to split one with my dining partner. That will leave room for their incredible buffalo wings, which I've noticed have escaped mention in most Yelpers' reviews.Simply put, the wings here are exceptional. Although they only offer one flavor of hot wing, their take on the classic buffalo wing is a keeper. The sauce is bright and tangy (and I recommend ordering some of the wing sauce on the side as it would even make a flip-flop dipped in it taste AWESOME). What really completes the wings here is the char. I guess that bajillion-degree-oven really adds the finishing touch, as the burnt and smoky flavor that comes through is pure wing bliss.So I recommend if you go to The Grind, do try the burgers. But split the behemoth and save room for the wings. That way you won't need the Oompah-Loompahs to roll your bloated ass back to your car and you will have a dining experience to remember (and to salivate about, in retrospect).",1
"Carl Johnson is an amazing accountant and person.  We have been working with Carl since 2008.  We were referred by a family friend and have never regretted our decision to have Carl complete our taxes every year.  He is kind, effective, detail oriented, and goes above and beyond the expectations of his job.I highly recommend Carl Johnson of One Source Accounting Solutions for all accounting services.Keep up the great work Carl!",1
"So...I'm in love. The variety of all the familiar and new helados, paletas, raspados, smoothies, batidos...i can come here every day and never repeat! The staff is courteous and eager to help you get exactly what you want by letting you try as many flavors as necessary. I'm SO glad this place exists!!!¡¡Muchísimas gracias!!",1
"Dr. Kay is the best dentist I have been to. I cannot say enough positive things about Dr Kay as well as his entire staff and office. Dr. Kay is always on time, kind, and very professional. He explains everything in a manner that a patient can understand and explains all the options available to me. When I had the work done that I needed he was very gentle and did an amazing job. He also called to follow up after hours to make sure I was alright, answer any questions and wasnt experiencing any problems. He exceeded all my expectations and I would highly recommend him.",1
They are amazing in every way. Healthy fresh delicious food made perfect every time. The drive through option is awesome! The staff is so friendly and wonderful! I eat here almost every day!,1
The most friendly staff you will ever come across. Everything is always so polite and nice. Food is great too!,1
Like because:1) Prompt pickup and drop off to and from airport. 2) Car location ticket reminder is issued by the driver.3) Helpful and courteous driver.4) Reasonable daily parking fees.5) Discount coupon6) Parking garage close to airport.,1
"Our waitress, Ellen, is nice as can be! What a lovely person to be able to interact with while enjoying a great meal! :) We were also frequently helped by another really nice woman named Maylani. There wasn't a moment in time when our glasses weren't full. :) The food was absolutely amazing! We couldn't believe how quickly the food came out despite how incredibly busy they were. I got the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, and I fell in love with the immense amount of flavor that was packed into such a perfectly sized pasta dish! I can't wait to come back and dine again!",1
"First thing I appreciate about this office is the acknowledgement of the situation I was in when I called for an appointment this morning.  They knew right away by my diagnosis by the ER where I was seen over the weekend for a 7.3mm kidney stone, as to why I would like to be seen right away. They were able to get me in within 4 hours!  I didn't care if there was a wait in the office, or if the receptionist was less than excited to see me. Dr Shaba was very prompt, listened to what I had concerns with and addressed everything, as well as suggested the best option for a procedure. Also mentioned the blood test for parathyroid condition if you have had gallstone/kidney stones in the past to curb any more in the future! I do NOT want to go through the same pain I experienced over the weekend that took me to the ER.  Right now i'm waiting for my procedure to be scheduled. Thankful and pleased so far with treatment.",1
"I have absolutely nothing negative to say about Herbs & Rye. I have been here at least 10 times and I leave extremely satisfied each and every time. If anyone ever asks me for a good date night spot, steak spot, cocktail spot, or just a dinner recommendation actually, HA! First of all do every one a favor and make a reservation. Don't get pissy because you didn't call ahead for one of Las Vegas's busiest happy hours. The steak is always cooked perfectly, the sauces are great, and every side that I have tried is delicious. This place is the real deal.",1
Food was outstanding. With HOWARD as your waiter it's like dinner and a show. Very professional and funny at the same time! This place is a must visit! All the food made from scratch and in-house it's worth the wait. We had a party of 7 and seated right away. Visit here and you won't be disappointed.  Ask for Howard he's the best waiter they have!,1
"This place had the most amazing staff. We came in for cocktails, which were wonderful and reasonable, cause we had a flat tire. In the end a good bit after closing, when the tow truck never came, the manager helped us change the tire. They totally restored my faith in humanity, the food looked and smelled amazing. I can't wait to come for dinner",1
Great local pizzeria. Solid pizza. Fantastic mozzarella sticks that are lightly deep fried compared to other places. Accepts btc. Clean inside. Quick service.,1
"I have driven by this place so many times and wanted to try it.  Today, I finally decided to drop in and I'm glad to have done it.  I walked here with my dog since it's close by.  They specialize in flavored coffee.  I'm not a super fan of flavored coffee but on hot days I will indulge in a frozen coffee.  I figured I'd give a frozen coffee and a hot black coffee a try today.  Both were delicious.  Their hot black coffee is very reasonably priced so I may come here more often.  They do serve a limited breakfast. Some donuts and oatmeal.  I had a donut this time, but I plan to try their oatmeal in the future. They don't have any indoor seating.  They have a drive thru and a walk up window.  They do, however, have plenty of tables and chairs outside for good weather days. I had brought my dog along with me and they offered her a pupacini.  It's just a cup of whipping and some biscuits, but my dog totally enjoyed it to the last bit.",1
"Update 07/14 Still my favorite place, and they have even drastically improved their appearance. Good lookin seats, repainted and even new bold signage out front. It's still not the Ritz of dining rooms but I gave an extra star for the improvements.",1
"Excellentes crêpes, accompagnées d'un bolée de cidre.... Le souper fut délicieux! Le café Breizh est un endroit fort sympathique, l'ambiance est chaleureuse et sans flafla. Nous avons choisi les crêpes de sarrasin ( légères!) : la nordique, au saumon fumé, ainsi que la québécoise aux pommes, bacon et sirop d'érable. Un vrai régal, a prix d'ami.",1
"This is one of my all time favorite brewery's to go to. It doesn't look like much from the outside but when you walk inside it feels like you are in a wood cabin. I really like the atmosphere there and there are always cool people there. They normally have about 30 beers on tap and they don't wait a single tap on Miller lite, Bud lite, or anything else like that. If they don't have what you like on tap, then just turn around from the bar and check out their coolers. Behind the glass doors of their coolers they have well over 100 beers you can pick from. You pick the bottle you want, and you can drink it there, or take it home with you. AWESOME!!!I stuck with the beers on tap and had to begin the night with their classic Orange Blossom which is brewed there and tastes like a melted orange creamsicle with vanilla and beer. Trust me it is good, but it is hard to drink more then one because it is a sweet beer.Being a dark beer guy I wanted to try a new dark beer and thankfully I was steered away from the Donnybrook made by Victory in PA. I did try a small sample of it and it was like a thin watery version of a Guinness. The Black Xantus made by Humboldt Brewing in CA came highly recommended, and was FANTASTIC! It is a barrel aged imperial stout that comes in a goblet and has just become one of my favorite stouts I have ever had. Then to stick with the theme of trying new things I had a Red's Rye which is a Rye IPA made by Founders in Grand Rapids MI. I was actually very impressed with this IPA. I normally do not enjoy IPA's, but I would drink this again any day.Overall experience here was 5 stars! Everything I drank was right on the money, and the good people there kept me away from the few lack luster beers they had. This place makes you feel at home, welcome and comfortable. Oh yea, they do have food which looked good too, but it's hard to find time to eat with all that top rate beer there.",1
I've been a client for many years and the staff and services are great. The hair stylists listen to what you want and do a great job. Highly recommend!,1
This place is the best. They really set the bar. Food and service are amazing. Yes it's costly but you need to do it! Loved every bite!,1
"Rex and all the guys are amazing!  Not pushy at all,  very thorough,  very competitive pricing. Makes you feel like you're in a small town.  They remember me by name,  my bf too. Super flexible,  can't say a bad thing about em.  I love that they'll tell me what needs to be done and what I can hold off on until later.  Very reliable work.  Never had a problem with any work they've done.",1
"I work nearby and have had the salads on several occasions they are made fresh to order with grill chicken which had a great flavor, or chicken salad is yummy too on a bed of greens. The prices are a little expensive but I guess salads aren't cheap anymore. It's always busy during lunchtime.I will surely revisit ""Tilt"" for next lunch.",1
"This mini putt course is recently remodeled and super cute! The clubs were nice and there were plenty of fun colored balls to choose from. From old fashioned skunk figurines in the middle of green to the traditional multi-hole par 4-type settings, this course was everything we were looking for on a lazy afternoon day. We had a blast and will be back soon!",1
The best hands down! I got my through my entire Brazilian wax for the first time with them a few years back! Raven is AMAZING! I have deployed and come back and have had great wax specialist but Raven is by far my fav. She is sweet and very personable. Makes a slighty uncomfortable situation very comfortable! I so wish I could take her with me on my next assignment! Needless to say she is my go to!,1
"Really nice people here. My son has some sensory development issues and has trouble focusing. Doctor Miles was really patient, and fun and friendly! He was able to get the exam done with minimal frustration to my little boy. Will definitely bring the rest of the family here and myself when it's time for our exams.",1
The property has a lot of potential. Just started lifting this year and found that this is a good alternative to the PNC YMCA. The trainers are pretty kind as well.,1
"I LOVE the Bamboo Club - hands down the best Asian restaurant in Scottsdale. Not only is the food absolutely delicious, but it's affordable. In addition, they have a fantastic wine list - and a very knowledgeable and friendly staff. One of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.",1
Best Thai food I have found in the Akron area! I have been driving past this place and have wanted to check it out-and finally did after reading the yelp reviews. I had an egg roll and the chicken pad Thai and both were delicious. The pad Thai had just the right amount of spice and I asked for mild. And the prices can't be beat either! I will definitely be coming back here again. I recommend it to anyone craving Thai!,1
Our favorite Italian restaurant so far in Scottsdale!! We always get the Hand made thick and chewy noodles!!Sooooo  gooood!!,1
"I had an excellent experience with Fairmount Massage.  Jorge was a fantastic massage therapist who was very professional, yet personable.  He went above and beyond, and this was one of the best massages I've ever had!  He even provided some tips for stretching and releasing the muscles in my back, which were of a particular concern for me.  I would highly recommend this place!",1
"I have been going to this Olive Garden for years. I never have a bad experience. The parking lot can be scary at first because it is usually packed and you might think that it will take forever to get a spot inside but they know how to keep things moving along. We went on a Sunday night around Dinner time and only waited 5 minutes. Sometimes it does take a bit longer but when people know good food they flock to it!We started out with salad which I honestly can never get enough of! They were having the ""Never Ending Pasta Bowl"" on this visit. I chose ""Angel Hair with 5 Cheese Marinara"" and the sauce was just delicious!  I think I found my new favorite sauce :) It's not authentic Italian food, but there's just something about it. I usually rate 4 stars for OG, but this location just always goes above and beyond anything I'd ever expect from an Olive Garden!Our server was excellent. He was always checking on us and never let the bread basket go empty for long. When it came time to pay for our bill we each had pasta left and he brought us more sauce to put on top and even put a couple sausage links on top and then packed it to go for us along with some bread sticks. I left full and fulfilled!",1
"I went here on a busy Monday night and had a great experience. The wait wasn't terribly long, but I like how the expected wait is displayed when you check-in, so you know if it will be worth it or not to eat there. They also have an option where you can have a link to a live feed of the time until you will be seated texted to your phone, which I used the entire wait.The AYCE is amazing, as there are three tiers to the menu. We chose the middle one because it had just enough options without being overwhelming. The meats are very good and the little sides are unlimited. The coolest thing is the little conveyor cart thing that is in between each aisle of booths that brings your food to you. It makes it so that the server can concentrate on other things, like refills, and allows for service to be quicker so that other people can be seated faster as well. I like efficiency!All the food was tasty and easy to use the grill. Now, as with any KBBQ, you will smell like food afterwards, but it is so good. I love Korean food but this one is one of my favorites for KBBQ. Keep it coming!",1
Nothing can go wrong with in and out . The service was great I asked for a couple of sauces to take home and the cashier was glad to give me some . I highly recommend animal fries when you visit in n out,1
Iconic deli. It's a must visit if you're in Montreal. The sandwich itself was great...just meat and bread (nothing to get in the way of enjoying the smoked meat).,1
"Best fries anywhere!  Real Belgian style fries with aioli, excellent burgers with interesting tap beer selections.  A great neighborhood bar that doesn't try to do too much- it just has great food, beer, and service for a reasonable price.  Brunch is also excellent and ALMOST EVERYTHING can be served gluten free so I can dine with my Celiac friends.  Love this place.",1
Ok so I love this place... Matt always takes care of us right away! Never wait to be acknowledged if he's working. Patrick is also great if you need any help with anything at G.O.A.T. Butttt the reason I felt compelled to right this review is the fucking Karoke cake...Hands down the best vegan dish I've had at a local bar in vegas!! Great atmosphere staff and VEGAN FOOD!!!!,1
Beautiful salon! The women there was super nice and great to chat with. They took their time and made sure my nails looked great. I just did a simple gel manicure and pedicure but the work they did on the nails of women around me was amazing!! I definitely would return!,1
"My girlfriend, my husband and I have eaten there three times lately. Gourmet food, great prices and a huge surprise inside what I thought was just a coffee place. So much more",1
GREAT stay for your buck! We really loved the design of our room. The stuff was extremely helpful and friendly! A very convenient location!,1
Really enjoyed our meal there tonight.  All the dishes that we had were great especially the BBQ chicken and the short ribs.  The atmosphere was really nice. The service was excellent. It was obvious that others were enjoying their meals too.,1
"BEST ""ice to coffee ratio"" of any iced coffee or iced cappuccino I have ever tried (and I've worked at Tim Hortons and Starbucks), lots of seating, Wifi and has that ""downtown indie coffee shop"" feel without the crowds or pretension. This place is very much needed in the suburban no man's land that is ""Old East York Village""",1
This place delivers exactly what they promise - cold beer and cheeseburgers! My favorite thing there was the tater tot nachos - SO GOOD!,1
"We originally found this Napa Auto Care Center over 3 years ago when we lived right around the corner. We first chose it for mere convenience and the very affordable oil change and free tire rotation. The friendliness and very honest, upfront approach by the owner Jack and his staff is what has always kept us coming back! From a standard oil change to more costly vehicle repairs (such as brakes/rotors, starters, and timing belts), we have always felt that we were getting high quality work at the best possible price from honest guys who genuinely love their jobs and their customers. What a rare gem to find in the car repair/maintenance world! We now live on the other side of Gilbert and still are willing to pass multiple shops that are far closer to home, just to have the peace of mind that comes with dealing with the quality folks at this Napa Auto Care Center. It is our privilege to recommend them and to remain a customer for life!",1
"The breakfast buffet is amazing. Omelettes are amazing, banana bread is yummy and lots of fresh fruit to choose from. Mr. Ricketts the Jamaican chef at the omelette station is super friendly and is a great cook. Julio the server was very friendly. Definitely get breakfast here. This was the best part of our stay. I personally prefer the fairmont princess hotel to the jw marriott camelback but the breakfast buffet is a must here.",1
"I have been going here for  over two years and it is by far one of the best Starbucks I have visited.   The people are very friendly and have some of the same people working there for over two years.  I will admit that some of the staff are not as outgoing as others, but they do not last long.  I always know that you are going to a quality place when you see the same customers day after day.  So much better than the Starbucks in Safeway on bell.",1
"Nick has been my waiter the many times I've been to Bazaar Meats, and I'd change my reservation to another date/time to get him every time. He's patient, knows food, knows the 3-8 menus you'll look at while you're there (crazy number of menus!!!), and he'll ensure you have the perfect experience. Start with the gin & tonic. I'm not even a gin & tonic gal and it's one of my favorite drinks of all time, but only from Bazaar Meats. Start there and then find the right wine pairings for your meal. There is a page of wine by the glass to choose from, not a ton, but if you're the only one wanting wine all you need is a glass or two. Let's be real - you'll need red wine to go with your meats. Automatically order the cotton candy foie gras when you order your drinks. It's like a bite of sweet whimsical butter. Your tastebuds will be inspired. Then you've got time to be walked through the menu with your senses engaged. Don't even peruse the menu(s) until your waiter walks you through them. It's overwhelming. If you're a first timer - start with a tasting menu. They normally have 3 tasting menus at $150, $200, or $275. The $200 is my go-to, main difference between that one and the $275 is the sucking pig. I forget what it's called but there is a table side sorbet you should get as a palette cleanser. It has booze in it, if I'm remembering correctly. Either way - this is more of a bonus than a must have. These are my favorite items I've had: the croquettes de pollo, the carpaccio with Parmesan, the caviar flight, the cold smoked oysters, Chateaubriand, sucking pig, grilled pulpo (octopus), classic tartare, geoduck. I won't go through all the veggies, but they're all good. You must order their mashed potatoes, as in must. Did I mention must. Go ahead and get 2 orders if you've got more than 3 hungry people. Desserts - yes please. Just get whatever you're feeling and you'll be happy. My least favorite orders are few, but they weren't worth the ordering in my experience. The chicharron was a giant mess of fried pig skin. It gets everywhere and is forgettable. The other disappointment was the Lindsay Ranch. It's pricey and the flavor was mild. For $95/lb there are better items on the menu. I feel like I always end describing the decor. It's the fat kid in me. I love the feel and appeal of Bazaar Meats. It's a mix between somehow glitzy random as hell and a hunting expedition. You'll see.",1
"The entire staff is great, but extra shoutout to Ron! I wanted to purchase a road and I spoke to Ron about my biking goals to help direct the purchase, as I am new to this hobby. Ron suggested, and I agreed, that I get fitted first, then we could decide on the road bike.  Ron spent over an hour fitting me for my bike; he was extremely thorough and educated me along the way.  Once we had the measurements, we searched online, as I needed a 44"", which is a hard size to find.  We found a great bike, a Specialized Amira SL4.  Once the bike arrived, Ron had me get on the bike to check the fit, he made some minor adjustments, and then I hit the road. I've had my bike for about 2 months and the fit is so perfect. I can actually ride 10 miles comfortably, without biking shorts, because I am so perfectly positioned on this bike, it's amazing. (I do wear biking shorts, but have jetted out a few times for shorter rides without them.)  I contribute this perfect fit to Ron and all of the time that he invested in me and fitting me for my bike.  He is truly an expert in his field and I highly recommend his services.  He is top notch, cares about the customer, and educates you along the way.  I only go to this shop for services and products.  They have earned my business.  Don't buy a new bike without seeing Ron first!!!!!!  Many thanks to the Landis Team!!  Dottie",1
"What a magnificent restaurant. Every good restaurant has a core identity that is never compromised and that all employees relate to and support.This restaurant is southern to its core and they have taken everything that is good about the south and packaged it to perfection without going crazy with the prices.The staff, ALL that we encountered, were outstanding as we were rushing to head to the airport and the service was super efficient, warm and friendly.Everything we ate was delicious and after 3 days in Vegas it was our best meal and our least expensive. We didn't have the chicken but it looked fantastic. We had quiche and eggs and bacon hash and a salted caramel bread pudding, which really ought to be subject to them requiring a license to serve. It was spectacular.Do not miss this GEM... it is worth going to the Venetian for.Patrick",1
My wife loves this place. Great location and Hannah and Tony always make you feel welcomed.,1
"I love fill a seat! I recently went to a performance and got a pair of tickets, $190 each, for free (well minus the membership)! They were the best seats there. Scored!!! Thank you fill a seat for the awesome tickets!! I definitely got my money's worth :D But do know the shows are a hit or miss but it's allowed me to attend events I normally wouldn't go to.",1
"Very nice environment! Since they just opened, there are limited amount of games but I am sure that will change. The games are all charged at a fair price, that is affordable.  They'd definitely have some games that I have never seen before. Environment is smoke friendly and is very clean! Definitely will come back some time soon.",1
"So good! The food was excellent and the staff was great. We had the bacon wrapped shrimp, crispy salmon sushi, filet mignon, and the truffle mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious! Without a doubt, the best steak we've ever had. The restaurant is beautiful and elegant with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. It is definitely pricey, but worth every penny. Not only are the food and wines great, but the servers offer exceptional customer service. It is the perfect place for celebrating special occasions or just a nice night out in Vegas!",1
"We went here for a dinner with friends on a Friday evening. The Commoner gave us an outstanding experience. The atmosphere is very trendy, with an open kitchen and dim lighting. The restaurant feels chic. The service was very professional and prompt. The drinks were very good. I got the Old Fashioned and my wife got the Moscow mule. Both were very well crafted. As for the food, we had the wild mushroom cigar for an appetizer, which I highly recommend. I had the burger for the main course. I ordered medium rare plus and the meat was cooked perfectly to my preference. The burger came with fries which had great seasoning. My wife ordered the Pork Chop. I tried a couple of bites and thought the meat was rich and flavorful. However, keep in mind it is a heavy dish. The portions are generous, the flavors are rich, we left with full stomachs. Will definitely come back to try some of their other dishes.",1
Yes! Bartenders are to notch. Steak tacos are on point. Moscow mules are succulent. Try the fried oysters.,1
"Kevin from KNK was prompt, professional and quick.  He was quick to solve problems and focused. The day before my appointment, I sent pictures of the electrical outlets to Chris who was the electrician who answered the phone, Chris texted me back immediately with which light bulbs to buy. I would hire KNK again if I had an electrical problem.",1
The food is amazing here.  It's as awesome as eating Rudy's barbecue down in Texas.   The owner and the staff are hella friendly and the service is awesome.   My wife and family and I eat here at least once a month.  I suggest the tri tip.  It's always on point.   Also get the fried okra.  You won't be disappointed i promise.,1
I've never been to a laundry mat before. I had to wash our comforter. The owner/manager walked me through the whole process and was so nice. It was fast and convienent. Very nice experience.,1
Love love love this place.  Buddy is so happy when he comes to visit here weekly. This is his extended family and I am grateful for the care you take with Buddy.  I do my best to let everyone know about the care and love you all have for dogs.Thank you.,1
What a great experience it's been with best window shower door repair Southern Highlands they have several locations around town but this location has been fantastic for me always coming through in a pinch. Whenever a broken piece of glass happens or in a big case when I needed a shower door repaired in one of my rentals since the old shower door was basically unusable anymore from the 80s. Best window shower door repair SH came out and took care of the whole issue in a couple days we had a brand new piece of glass installed and it looked great and the tenants were very happy. I couldn't be happier about the services and I would recommend anyone looking for a solid glass company that does custom glass work and mirrors in the Las Vegas - Southern Highlands area this is definitely a solid company that will take care of you and make sure that the job is done correctly 100% before they leave. Great local services!,1
"How many breakfast places still have Monte Christo's . To make it better they do it right Fried not grilled.  But they don't stop there, the meat is so tender you can cut this sandwich with a fork. As for service Tori did her job to perfection coffee was kept hot food was fresh and hot when it arrived. Have to come back though for the coffee cake.",1
Wow!! French cuisine and amazing views right across from the Bellagio fountains!  My guy & I went here for Easter dinner and we really enjoyed our French food! The service was exceptional and the food was fantastic!  It was a very romantic night!,1
"I love this place!! Chef Kenny is so creative w hes dishes, I've tried a lot of the stuff on the menu and I'm always satisfied! The cilantro salad and the sexy roll are my favorite! The prices are so reasonable, and the staff is super friendly! Give it a try plase!",1
"I went here for a first date, and had the best experience.  It was at the tail end of Charlotte Restaurant Week, but they had their full menu so we decided to try something they were known for.  They highlighted their Osso Bucco, and I don't think I've ever had Osso Bucco before, so I was sold (plus the line about ""slowly braised for 8 hours"").  It was honestly one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten, and I don't say that easily.  Velvety, rich, tender, and just freaking delicious, served over risotto.  Oh man.  We got a side of spinach to go with it, and a bottle of pinot noir.  We finished off with the mousse (not really my thing, but I was pretty full from dinner).  The dinner was fantastic, the ambiance was great, and Antonio even stopped by for a chat.  I'd go back in a heartbeat!  Definitely lives up to the hype.",1
Rachel's is the best place for a healthy lunch. Especially on a nice day where you can sit outside on the patio. Today Dakota was working and gave great customer service.,1
"Come and get your yoga on... This warm group of yoga teachers has something for everyone that is interested in learning about yoga.  I started going to YogaFlex after experiencing the Y yoga classes.  I was amazed at the night and day difference. I personally came to exercise my body and found that I stayed on to exercise mind, body and spirit.  The sense of community that is embraced by the Shari (owner), teachers and practitioners is something I have never experienced until I joined Yogaflex.YogaFlex offers lots of different kinds of classes - hot yoga, universal, astanga and basic.  There is something for everyone all day long.  And they bring in world-renowned teachers to give workshops.  YogaFlex is also highly committed to giving to our local and world community.  It is regularly the largest donor world-wide to ""Yoga Gives Back"", a charity that helps poor women in India start their own businesses.  I am proud to be a part of such a community.Guide to success - If you are going to Yogaflex (or any studio) for the first time you want to get in 10-15 minutes early to sign up and get the paper work out of the way. Trying to rush through any process is not fair to you nor the other people at any studio. Introduce yourself to the instructor either before or after class. You will find that this simple step will open the door to one of the warmest and caring communities in the area.  I have Yogaflex to thank for guiding me in my practice.  Thanks to all of the wonderful teachers. Namaste.BTW - 2012 Voters' Choice Best of the Best Winners - Yogaflex voted Best of the Besthttp://www.charlottemaga...?Do not yelp my review. Call me if you want to discuss it or email me.",1
"This was a blast!  Out door seating, cooling misters everywhere, awesome food, friendly staff, tons of tv screens playing various sports!  The garlic fries with apple wood smoked bacon aioli!!!!Didn't break the bank. Awesome people watching!!",1
Omg! I love the food!!! Drinks are so healthy and taste very dress defiantly coming back,1
"I love this place! The sandwiches are great, some of the best on Green St. and the service is pretty fast, too.",1
"Jet is by far the best person to work with especially when finding a home.  I found her through a Facebook ad and immediately contacted her for more inquiries; after our first meeting, I knew that we were in good hands.  She has made our home buying experience fast and painless.  She knew what we wanted and despite being so picky about every little detail, she was very patient and was able to quickly find us a home.  I love that she is very easy to talk to, she really takes pride in her work and that she is very knowledgeable.  I have recommended her to several family and friends and will continue to do so because I know she will not disappoint.",1
"Nice place. Easy to get to, good parking. No wait at 3pm on a Saturday. They took their time, and did a great job. The price was the same as other places I've gone to...I can see how it would get busy quick if you came during a peak time. I will be back!",1
"OMG!!  I couldn't wait to write my review for this place. For one I love Gordon Ramsay and this is the first time I've been to any of his restaurants!  My awesome friend and I came here after shopping and the service was great.  Our servers name was Mike and he was really tentative and provided great input for the drinks and food on the menu.  Based on his recommendation I ordered the Pub Crawl... I was in the mood for something where I could taste the alcohol.  I never had bourbon and I wanted to try something new... Definitely a great recommendation Mike, both my friend and I really enjoyed it.  My friend had a beer, I have no idea what it's called, just came in a cool gray bottle (I don't drink beer, but it's there fav one so I'm glad they had it there)So the food.. Uhh so good.For the Starters or App we had the Pork and Duck Rillettes.  That was delicious.  I will say it was interesting as well b/c I've never had anything like it.For the real deal we had the Fish and Chips and the Grilled Lamb Burger... OMG the burger was the kind that melts in your mouth... We took Mike's recommendation on ordering it medium... Yeah that was good.  I was a little nervous ordering fish and chips b/c I didn't think they could be any different, but once again Mike was right and the fish was amazing.  The breading melts in your mouth and doesn't fall off the fish.. Tartar sauce was good with it, and the peas were more for decoration for me, but they were actually seasoned well too.I know Ramsay and he would have expected nothing less than perfection at one of his restaurants.  I can't wait to go back on my next visit!!  We were definitely in food heaven going here!!  I will save a little room for dessert on round 2 and I will try some of Ramsay's other places on the next visit.",1
"Great service from Lizzie and tasty food. Can't believe these scrumptious pulled pork tacos and mushroom flatbread (both large enough to be meals) are each $5 happy hour apps. Coupled with outside dining and music being played on street makes this a fantastic stop on my biz travels.  If nearby, it's definitely worth it!!!",1
This place is close to work so I stop by often for lunch or Boba. Its pretty good! The food is tasty and affordable and the boba is yummy too. The young girl who I always see at the register is super sweet and always extremely attentive.,1
Excellent Baja style mexican food to stay or go. The food is prepared well and very fresh ingredients and salsa bar...well worth the stop.,1
"I live nearby this gem of a restaurant. I fell in love with it on my first visit. They serve the typical Mexican fare. The servers are always smiling and pleasant. I usually order the vegetarian burrito, which is not even on the menu.  I'm making myself hungry just writing this review. Try this restaurant and you will see for yourself.  ;)",1
"My wife and I love this gem of an Italian restaurant.  We love the ambiance, Silvia, the impeccable waitress, Ozzie, the affable owner and Johnny, the perfect bar host, and, of course the food.  The food is what people come here for and we have never had anything that we did not enjoy very much.  Their seafood dishes are wonderful; full of flavor, not over priced (very reasonable) and a good portion.  Their pasta dishes are great; Veal Parmesan?  Great!  Eggplant Parmesan?  Wonderful!  Appetizers?  Terrific!  Wine list?  Decent as well.  Desserts? MMMMMMMM!The staff here is personable, attentive, and really care about your experience.  We love to come here and the only reason we don't frequent more often is so that we don't get nonchalant about it.  In fact, we are going to be there tonight and made reservations.  Hope to see you there!",1
"I had the roasted Brussels sprouts, beets with grapefruit and orange creme fraiche and butternut squash and forbidden rice coconut curry with a Chenin Blanc - amazing.  Finished off with the caramelizad granola with a white wine berry reduction, fresh blueberries and an orange, yogurt whipped cream and, of course, Colectivo coffee.  Everything came out fresh and perfectly cooked.  Our service was attentive and cordial without being intrusive.  The room was fresh and modern but had enough warm wood to be cozy.  This is a great dining experience.Outstanding vegetarian and pescatarian options.  I only eat kosher meat and usually don't have so many options!",1
First timer and was impressed.  Came around 6:30 with a group of friends.  We were only there for drinks.  I really enjoyed their drinks.  I got the Benton's old fashion and the flower child.  I would recommend both.  The staff is really nice too.  You'll be seeing me back for drinks again.,1
I was shocked to find out that this was one of my friend favourite restaurant on the strap it looks like the house diner service was very good and my friend was fond of a Challah bread sandwichWe have just came from the Britney Spears concert for the second time and we stopped in I have never been there it was my first visit very nice staffI never had chicken and waffles before in my life so this was a first for meI'm sorry I can't remember at the servers name it was a young guy with glassesUnfortunately two of my girlfriends got into work crazy heated argument and the manager came over and it was pretty bad but it was very amusing to the rest of the patrons because both of my girlfriends are completely psychotic,1
"Purchased a pineapple palm tree November 2018, and had it delivered and planted, impressed with the service and knowledge of there staff, Jonna Altheim, nursery professional assisted me and helped me choice the correct tree for my yard and project, will use there service for future projects and would recommend them to anyone considering any landscaping purchases",1
"If I could do 10 stars it wouldn't be enough!! This place absolutely exceeded all expectations in every single category!! Our waiters name was chris. Very mellow fellow but he went ABOVE AND BEYOND! He asked if we were returning or new, once we told him it was our first time he proceeded to open up the menu and explain each cocktail in detail, then placed our order for drinks. Came back and did the same for all the food items. This guy knew his stuff and you could tell he actually cares about his customers and wants them to have the best experience possible!! I ordered the pork chop and my girlfriend ordered the salmon. Both plates were so good we hardly spoke to each other until the plates were clean! Our drinks were brought out quickly and were well balanced, not watered down or too strong. I am normally pretty strict with reviews as I was in the business for years. This place left me with nothing negative to say at all. I'm a huge hip hop head, especially the old stuff. So when we sat on the patio and were graced with non stop 90's hits from biggie, digital underground and why tang, to name a few I was more then pleased?! And when pictures of biggie and TLC are on the menu, you know it's legit. In closing, we will be back again and again!!",1
"I love the care I receive from Complete Care Medicine.  I am able to get an appointment in a very timely manner.  I also appreciate that on the day of my appointment, there is hardly any waiting.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The only PA I have seen is Trent Blake.  He is very knowledgeable, kind and caring.  He takes his time and explains everything very well.  I have family and friends that have seen other providers in the office and they are as equally satisfied.  I highly recommend this Family Practice.",1
"I'm really into this bar, but only every now and then. they get a lot of the same kinds of requests, and they usually play them on rotation each weekend, so i wouldn't recommend coming every week.the musicians are good and have lively personalities. to make a request you write the song on a bar napkin and walk it up to the stage and drop it on the piano top with a couple of bucks (or more, depending on how badly you want to hear your song).p.s. unless you're a dummy dont' fall for the UofA v. ASU fight song battle. they do this every time i go in, and basically drunken bros try to ""outbid"" one another to hear one song over the other (during the rose bowl, etc, the respective teams are inserted). anyway, i've seen some poor way too drunk fool plop down $100 in effort to have his team song played over another - pretty smart gimmick for the players, pretty crappy for the dude who has to to realize, ""wait, did i really pay $100 to hear a song last night?""i think the drink prices are steep here, but it's a fun time and you're getting live entertainment.",1
First time going here and this place was awesome! Mike was our server and service was excellent. I got the 3lb stuffed lobster and this was my first lobster and it was fantastic and they crack it for you! Atmosphere is really cool being under ground and they had the best crab cakes I've ever had. Would for sure recommend.,1
Came in around 8 on a Friday night for drinks. Great atmosphere & bartenders. Can't wait to come in for food next time !,1
"I'm in love with this place and was happy to learn there was an East Coast location.  Came here to celebrate a birthday and was already entranced with the pawn store front.  We lingered for a good ten minutes before being escorted through the door and into the main restaurant, which was gorgeous in design.  I was a bit thrown off by the ambiance as the decor was very clean, old-fashioned, dark, and beautifully constructed in contrast to the DJ spinning the best in classic and current R&B/Hip-Hop tracks. Food was amazing and in tapas style so the more you order the fuller you are, and came out very quickly.  Drinks were strong--like put-you-on-your-back-strong--so the prices made sense. Definitely suitable for large groups. Great concept and great food.",1
One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Also the best lunch deal in Las Vegas they offer a 20.12 three course prefix but I would recommend spending the extra $10 and getting the grilled octopus.  I would also recommend the milo's special appetizer deep fried zucchini and eggplant chips with tatziki sauce.,1
"Our second time at Ocean Poke and just like the first time, I am leaving with a smile on my face. Not only is the food delicious but it's also healthy. Tonight, I had the Kim Chi bowl which was amazing! The combo of the favors were perfect and everything was fresh. I got salad as my base instead of rice or quinoa. The shrimp is marinated in kimchi...can you say ""YUM""! And a bonus is that almost all of the sauces are gluten and dairy free so the options aren't limited like other places for people with food allergies. My daughter (8 yrs old) got a kids bowl and she selected spicy salmon and enjoyed choosing all of the fresh veggies to fill up her bowl. She also tried the Acai bowl for dessert tonight and thoroughly enjoyed that too.But I must say, the one thing that I think sets this place apart and makes me warm inside when I visit is the staff. Chris and the crew are so friendly, helping to answer questions and making sure everything is to your satisfaction. The atmosphere is bright and airy...the music, the decor, the community table and the people creates such positive energy that it's kinda washes away whatever negative vibes that you may have come in with. Corny, I know...but it's the truth. At least for me . By the way, I wasn't planning on writing a review but my 8 year old asked me to take pics, suggested I write a review and after I witnessed how nice Chris was to us, I couldn't resist. Go check it out!",1
"I had a great visit today. The store was spacious, clean, and looked awesome. Service was friendly and accurate. I only ordered a side of mac and cheese and a cookie, but both tasted fantastic. That mac and cheese could give any restaurant a run for their money. I hope to come back and try other things from their menu. You can tell this restaurant is ran with pride and it definitely shows. Great job, guys!",1
"Really enjoyed my experience at Campechano Taquería! Food: Tacos were delicious, I tried 3 different types, my favourite of which was the al pastor. They're very heavy on the cilantro so if you're not a fan, let them know and they will not include it! Chips and guacamole were terrific as well. Service: Service was great, our waitress was really knowledgable of the menu and was able to provide recommendations to those who were having trouble deciding which tacos to try. Ambiance: Tucked away in what appears to be a house, a fair amount of seating (bench and table) in the back area as well as scattered tables in the front area along the walls. Mexican-style paintings on the wall. Will definitely return!",1
"I live 30+ miles away from Sun Valley Stereo but they are the only place I will take any of my vehicles for electronic upgrades. I have had a touch screen dvd player w/ satellite radio, subs and an amp all installed by Ryan's staff. They are very knowledgable and will go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied with your install. Never do they try to upsell or get you to buy anything you don't need, plus they offer affordable prices. The box they built for my subs sound GREAT and when I had my amp installed in the trunk of my car, they built a box around it to make it look nice and flush with the trunk floor without me even asking! That's what kind of quality and care you can expect from these guys. It's nice to have honest people, who know what they're doing that you can trust to get your ride sounding good! I can't wait for my next installation! Thanks Ryan and Staff!",1
We were at the Sheraton PHOENIX and had an amazing service at the restaurant Alexis Iván Zúñiga made sure we had everything we needed. Thanks for the great service!,1
"Wonderful lounge at the Las Vegas airport!Staff is very professional and courteous. The space is plush and modern, arranged so there are ample cozy spots so you don't feel you're among many other people. All seats seemed to have at least four plugs so iPhones, iPads, laptops, etc... can be charged simultaneously. There is an open bar and buffet, conference room, showers, long tables, cushy chairs, built-in seats, etc... You can't hear the general airport announcements so it's very peaceful, but there are screens with flight info that can be seen from most seating areas.",1
"Our first time here and we absolutely loved it!  Patio was great and dog-friendly.  Live music. We ordered the brat sliders and artichoke dip and they were both fabulous!  Drinks were perfect!  Brad the bartender was so kind and attentive.  Our server, Shelly, was absolutely amazing - attentive, kind, and professional!  Great experience and we will be back!  Thank you!",1
"So far above average that it's well worth the sightly increased prices. This place is like no other. The service is prompt and courteous, and you can taste the quality that goes into every bite.",1
I have been going to Dr. Sullivan for 15 years. I find him to be personable and very direct. I like my truth straight up.  He cares greatly about his patients. I suggest Dr Sullivan greatly.,1
"I've been here mAny times and the bartenders are generous. When you walk in, the decor is phenomenal and the people are welcoming. Get you artttt on; when you realize itLindsey",1
"vegas taco bar was such a hit at my 30th birthday bash! josh was so helpful and fun to be around! he did an amazing job. the food was incredible, all my guests were asking for business cards! thanks again! i can't wait to use your services again in the future! xoxo",1
"I had such a great time yesterday. I would highly recommend doing the tour. The trainers are very knowledgeable and can tell you about all the different personalities of the cats. Like Geno and how he tries to spray people. It was hilarious to watch my dad run away. We did the feeding too and choose George. If you are by Coco's enclosure and if a trainer is nearby, see if they can get Coco to do her trick. She won't do it though if she knows her sister Cheetoh is looking.",1
"My coworker raved about this place and has been bugging me about needing to try them out. Decided to try it out last week after class was out and I definitely have to say I love it! It is one of the best sushi places I've been to. Lots of fish, less rice, more variety, very attentive and the desserts!! Even though you're limited to 1 specialty dessert, it's great! Because each time you come back, you can try a different one. I think it's Korean and Japanese mixed based off of some of the appetizers and dessert on the menu. Can't wait to go back! My mouth is watering, just thinking about this.",1
This place is amazing for a quick stop for an extremely healthy meal! Smoothies and food comes out extremely quick and they have so many different healthy options! Definitely my new go to place for a meal on the go or a protein packed meal after a good workout!,1
"We came on a Sunday and the zoo was not crowded. There are a good number of animal animal exhibits here and the main attraction, four panda bears, did not disappoint. Coming from the states I was impressed by the free WiFi and charging stations. It was also a nice surprise to find a butterfly room and beautiful gardens to walk.",1
"Wonderful location for our daughters wedding at the ASU Stadium.  Wonderful, helpful staff, immaculate room, great kitchen and the balcony was a treat in the evenings.  We will certainly stay here again and would recommend this location.",1
"Tiffany Coffee serves one of the best tasting decaf iced coffees, period! I love regular coffee, but there are days I need to lay off the caffeine but still crave the taste, and this beverage fits the bill nicely. They also serve the oh-so-good sweet potato latte, and lately we've also began to venture further and try some of their other offerings such as the Pat Bing Soo (Korean shaved ice), a perfect summer-time dessert, and those scratch-made, fish-shaped pastries filled with delicious red bean paste (also called Taiyaki)! So one might ask what could be better? Well the service of course! The nice lady that works there is prompt and attentive, always greets everyone with a pleasant smile.",1
"Love their succulent plant. They provide a large selection of succulent plants and cactus. You can ask the owner to plant your choice of cactus into the cute little pot. My boyfriend ordered this heart sharp succulent plant set for me on the Valentine's Day, I really love the setting of it. Will definitely come back to buy more plants in the summer.",1
I have been going to this place for while now n I love love the worker Lila and my sister and cousin love Sasha they really take of us  all of them are really nice  V,1
"Enjoyed a lovely lunch with my mom here on a weekday.Our server was lovely and very attentive.We started with the mushroom appetizer to share - it was delicious. Roasted wild mushrooms with frisee lettuce, and savoury cheese, so good! Our server also brought us some fresh bread with a little bit of house made hummus, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.For my main, I went with the spelt veggie spaghetti with ricotta and pesto - amazing! My mom selected the pizza with spicy salami and she loved it.The restaurant itself was beautiful and I think would be excellent for a date night as well. Absolutely will return again!",1
"Memento Mori is a very cool public art exhibit tucked away in an alley in Pittsburgh's Cultural District. The artist, Mary M. Mazziotti, explores a time honored tradition (Memento Mori translates to ""Remember your mortality""), which dates back to ancient Rome, and was especially popular in the Middle Ages). The artist uses the contemporary format of the billboard and cartoons to playfully deal with the subject of death and the fragility of life. Sponsored by the Cultural Trust, you will find this series of billboards in the same little side street as Cell Phone Disco, the provocative interactive art piece that is rather well promoted.",1
"I would really like to give Shibuya four and a half stars because its over priced--but that's Vegas.  Otherwise the food was excellent.  Every bite of my seared Akami tuna was blissful.  The tuna was in a nice sweet sauce that ended with a spicy finish.  We also tried the Sushi (Rainbow roll) which was also fresh and exceeded my expectations.  We didn't try any Sake, though their menu claims to have the largest selection of sake on this side of the Pacific, but my martini, made with Japanese alcohol, was excellent.I also enjoyed the atmosphere.  The restaurant is divided into intimate sections by floor-to-ceiling wooden dividers reminiscent of cascading water which leaves the space feeling open yet private.  As is typical of all over-priced Vegas restaurants, there is a hip, smooth vibe and plenty of chicly dressed patrons.  Service was above average.",1
Lived here almost 5 years ....  Never had a problem with safety at all.  Don't see cops.  Lots of families and dogs and beautiful grounds ...  Walk around and jog after dark all the time!  Never a problem. Staff are professional.  Don't know what these people are talking about at ALL!,1
"Whenever I want a warm slice of joy on my lunch break ... I come here. My pizza is perfect every time and they are aware / on top of my food allergies. It's always been clean. Staff always friendly, efficient, & full of smiles.",1
"SERIOUSLY AWESOME!!!!!!! I was always fascinated and wanted to go to one, Andrea Ruggles is part of the team, she said hey come down, so we did!!! SO FUN!!! Gotta say, we like to go, it is a cheap fun evening!! The kids love it, it is family friendly, inexpensive AND SERIOUSLY JUST FUNNNNNN!!!! Try it, YOU WILL LIKE IT!!! I wish I was younger, I would love to be a roller girl!!!!! AWESOMENESS!!!! Great group of people great fans...it is a great experience!!!",1
"Goodness gracious alive, do I ever love this place.I head out to U.S. Egg a couple of Sundays a month with my roomie and her pops.  We are seated speedily, and any number of leggy beauties are at our beck and call for the entirety of our stay.  The owner is gracious, and the waitresses are perpetually smiling.  The vibe is light.The clientele runs from old folks to hipsters to the hangover crowd.  The menu has quite a bit to choose from, but I always have the spinach florentine (try it; i promise you won't regret it).   I've heard tell that the veggie benedict and eggs over easy are remarkable, as well.  Servers leave a pitcher of ice cold water with us as we eat--they don't pester us or rush us or hint that we need to leave, even when our conversations run long.  I can't think of a better place to get breakfast.",1
"I have been greatly helped by Dr. Bos. I originally sought help from him after a car accident. My previous chiropractor and physical therapists couldn't help me. After just a few sessions, my neck was feeling much better. I began to learn about the other services he offered and was ultra impressed. His knowledge about health, and the body is amazing. He is very kind, and easy to talk to. He continues to help me with keeping up with my health.",1
"Rosa's is awesome.  It flourishes despite its sketchy surroundings.  The location is downright scary from the outside - beaten-down old half-empty strip mall, with a clothing store next door that sells new clothing, but makes a typical thrift store look like Neiman-Marcus.  If you were just driving by, the odds you'd want to stop are near zero.  Don't be deterred!  Once inside, you'll be quite comfortable as the surroundings are nice and comfortable.I've had several items here, but have settled lately into their fajitas.  I always order a chicken/beef combo, and I swear they simply double the portion of meat by giving full servings of each.  The beef is unusually good for fajita beef, very steak-like and tasty.  Zombie Girl generally goes for the shrimp tacos, which she loves.Prices are reasonable, service is competent and friendly, and the value proposition is strong.  Rosa's earns a solid 4.5 stars on the patented, trademarked and copyrighted Brak-O-Meter, a half-star withheld for location.. but rounded up to 5 due to all the positives.  Visit Rosa's tonight, you won't be disappointed.  And you know you can always trust Brak!",1
"Excellent food, awesome owner! Very delicious, would recommend to anyone looking for yummy take out.",1
I have removed this chore off of my annoying list thanks to Super Smog One - 7 minutes in and out the door!,1
"This is my second time here. I'll be back many more. Awesome service and if that isn't enough these days the food is AWESOME!!!!! Haven't had anything that wasn't five star worthy here. The habanero salsa is out of this world. A must try. If you know me you know how good this review actually is. I might just be a tad bit picky. Seriously, try this place. You'll be back.",1
"5 Stars for the greatest and most unique 'hole-in-the-wall'/local dive to grace the streets of Arizona. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it...because after you've tried it, you won't be able to knock it :)",1
"Best service, best breakfast and beautiful atmosphere. Don't forget to have the potatoes...they are a MUST every visit. Worth skipping your diet for!!!",1
Stopped in for some quick lunch while in vegas.    The service was good and they were fast and efficient and making my food.     The food itself was on point and good to the last bite.    I had no issues and would eat here again anytime,1
"I absolutely love this place.  It's easily accessible, the color selection is massive and all the girls are great!  They are very popular and I can see why!!  You'll definitely want to make an appointment because everyone has found this gem of a salon!",1
The cinnamon roll tasted so good that I had no idea it was vegan until I spoke to staff. I highly recommend trying their desserts out.I'll be back! :),1
"I like it there , this is a very very  nice restaurant , I enjoy number ""48"" its a rib eye with jalapenos ,   the real deal my friend  , , drink a lot of tea !!  I sat in the bar  everyone was having a lot of fun, friendly people at this place , nice atmosphere ,",1
First time here with my wife and we loved it. Our server Olga was great and we really liked the happy hour beef sliders.,1
"The experience I received was totally different. The main door was open by one of Bloom employee asking me how could he help me.  He turned me over to the employee checking people in and setting up accounts. Very quickly I might add.Was checked in and then lead to the waiting room. Didn't have to wait very long,was asked into the dispensary. There the gentleman helping me knew about the strains available and what they also had from time to time. No pressure to order quickly. Asked several questions that were answered without problem or question.Once finishing my order went to the purchase and pick-up area.  Again very quickThey go over the order with you advise cost and once again they were knowledgeable.  Also found I could order online and the order would be read when I got there.You just go to the purchase, pick-up room and advise you ordered online.Order was ready and handled quickly.   This is the way to get strains that selloutquickly. I order the night before and pick up when I""m ready. Bloom has earned my business.",1
"I came here based on a recommendation of a friend who'd spent his undergraduate years at U of I many years ago.  I'm just in town for a couple of nights so I wanted to make sure I got some quality deep dish or pan pizza while I'm out here.At lunch they offer their pan pizza by the slice and at a reasonable price.  The slice I had was covered in a beautiful mess of melted cheese, sauce, and thick chunks of delicious sausage.  The dough was thick and chewy-soft from the front all the way to the crust which had a really great crispness.  It was filling and just what I'd hoped it would be.  I paired that with a small Caesar salad and the bill came out to less than $8.",1
"This place is amazing ! If you like spicy , I would definitely recommend the TNT , the white sauce they also serve is amAzinggg!!!",1
"Love this place. Great food. Perfect portions. Clean environment. Fresh food. Really nice folks, as well. Mango Delight is the perfect lunch!",1
"Not even waiting to get home to write this reviewHANDS DOWN THE BEST HOT DOG I'VE HAD IN MY LIFEEasily beats out portillos...even my native Chicago husband agrees!Absolute foodgasm,  with none of the bad stomach feelings I always get after eating things like thisBbq pulled pork dog  I have many food allergies ... all their sauces are gluten free and I ordered it without onion rings and the bun...wouldn't have changed a thing about itI hope these guys get the opportunity to open up multiple locations one day! Plus the owner is the most friendly sociable person I've met. Great job guys you have us for customers for life, glad we found our weekly eat out spot!Thank you thank you thank you!!!",1
Top of the patisserie.  Each bite was delightful and amazing. My favorite out of the three was the pistachio eclair.,1
"I come here a few times a week as I work in the area and their customer service is so awesome. Every person that works here is so friendly and accommodating. The manager there, I believe his name is Chauncey, has the BEST attitude and brightens my morning every time he takes my order. He greets me by name and is honestly just a ray of sunshine. He takes such pride in his job and it definitely shows in his strong work ethic and happy demeanor. His positivity also reflects in his team. This is without a doubt the best McDonald's in Las Vegas! Thank you guys for all you do!",1
"Outstanding customer service, super friendly and very welcoming! Nate was our bartender and did a great job taking care of us. Honestly, it was super dead in the Ox when we were there but the staff was fantastic and we'll definitely be going back in the future. Great locals watering hole.",1
"This place was great. We ordered delivery last night, and then came over for dinner tonight. First off, best horchata in town (and we've sampled a ton!). The food was great: delicious and full of flavor. We got a burrito enchilada style which was giant and delicious. Also got the taco salad which was spicy and flavor packed. Their pico is spicy and fresh. Highly recommend!",1
"I took my sister and 14 month old nephew here while they were visiting.This is such a cute place. Lot's of grass and gazebos for picnics and parties. Cute gift shop, snack bar and playground areas.Train rides for the whole family and a carousel too!You don't need a kid to come and enjoy this park, pets are welcome too! They'll even let you bring your dog on the train!5 stars because I'll be back with my dog!",1
"Recently I had an issue with my gas powered weed eater. It is one of those commercial ones, older but still good to use. For some reason the carb was not working properly. So I brought it over to Hahn's for a free estimate. You have to love these guys honesty. My carb was toast! Burnt toast! And this was the surprise... the counter guy tells me to go over to Home Depot and buy a cheaper model, he even suggested one. He said it would be cheaper for me to buy a new one than it would be for them to fix it. How many businesses do that anymore? Not many. While I don't have the need to use their services often, I will be using them and recommending them others. Thanks for your honesty guys. It's appreciated. Now to go trim those bushes.",1
This place is D-Lish!!! I've been here several times and have never been dissatisfied. Things I love about Spinato's:The Nicole pizza: soooo yummyCesar salad: that giant crispy cheese thing with it Calzones: all of them. They're hugeBryce: best server everStuffed mushrooms: very rich,1
Belleza Wedding Chapel is wonderful!The experience exceeded our expectations. My husband and I had a last minute wedding. I called the chapel on a Tuesday to set up a Saturday evening wedding. Linda took care of everything. The photographer was a hoot and so talented. No one has ever made me look so beautiful in photos. I would recommend this chapel to everyone. They can fit any budget and have packages starting for as little as $99 dollars.,1
"Love this place! Staffs are very friendly and the place is nice and clean. Since I live on the east side, this is a bit too far from me but for the quality of the food it is well worth it! I ordered Strawberries, Kiwi Crepe with Vanilla IceCream and my best friend ordered Rocky road waffles with marshmallows. Both of them taste fantastic. Also before we ordered, the staff gave us a brief introduction about Japanese Crepes and gave us some recommendations for different items. They are also selling cream soda. How come I never knew there was such thing! I felt totally left out for the 2.5 years being in America ! Will surely return!",1
"I believe this restaurant is one of the best in the beach as far as fine dining establishments go. They understand food, wine and service. I've been on 4 occasions and have never been even slightly disappointed. I am the chef of a restaurant nearby and I take my hat off to Chef Fawzi for his understanding of flavours, textures, and his execution. I will be back when my newborn is not so new!",1
"I went not knowing what to expect as there isn't a lot of noise about the show, but the talent on stage and the energy that was coming from the crowd made my evening special!  This walk down memory lane (or for younger music lovers,  this in-person playlist of awesome songs you know built the music of today) is worth every penny.  To imagine that some in the ensemble sang with Ray Charles and the The Four Tops is all you need to know.  And Greg is crazy good; makes Chris Brown look uncoordinated!  These guys are great and deserve love, but not because they are a unique old school act and the Strip needs more of them, but because they have real talent (and lots of it).",1
"Angry American here...this is the real deal...Similar to NY, but cooler decor.   I think a lot of reviewers aren't really familiar with the Asian Noodle concept, but its REALLY tasty and a cool decor...strongly recommend.",1
"Love this place, every time I come here there's one lady that I love, she gives me good recommendations and always has a smile, not sure what her name is but she is great",1
"Excellent response time and communication, which is often rare to find. Professional and personable. Beautiful and efficient work, and affordable too.  Michael even found and repaired a leak in my sprinkler system while working on my lawn. Very pleased with his service all around. Highly recommend. Thank you!",1
"I have to admit that I wasn't a huge Beatles fan before seeing this show, but I enjoyed every second of it and the performance gave me a new found appreciation for their music.",1
"I have been here a bunch of times already and can't wait to go back again. They serve an incredible variety of dishes from all around the world juxtaposed against a funky graffiti decor  and tables named after Southside streets. Everytime I go I try to order something new, but on several occasions I just couldnt resist the roast pork broccoli rabe sandwich. It is honestly one of, if not the best sandwich I haver ever had. On top of the menu, which seems to get switched up every couple months, they have awesome cocktails. Everything is pretty inexpensive and the food portion sizes, especially the sandwiches, are crazy big for how little you pay.",1
Just opened! Clean and good customer service. The food is great and consistent with all the other branches. When I'm looking for good korean bbq with a little more this is the place to go! It's got not just the korean but a bit of everything!,1
"Love love LOVE this place. It's super chill, had some amazing food from the food truck and there are tons of board games. The mead is really good and surprisingly the flavors I enjoyed the most are the ones I didn't think I'd like such as the mango habanero. Will be back soon!",1
O'Neil House is the best! Owner Gail is a true gem! Our sleigh bed suite was beyond relaxing and the four course gourmet breakfast itself is 4 stars. It is a real treat to stay in the home that Gail saved demolition and restored it to its deserved grandeur. Definitely a MUST to experience in Akron.,1
"Pretty easy to pull into given how busy the intersection is. Cashiers are always really friendly. I always pay cash and they always remember to ask me for my rewards number. Consistently one of the cheapest prices in the neighborhood. Also, the window cleaner is always filled up and squeegees maintained.",1
This is a great addition to the area. I have been here a two times in the past few weeks.  The pollo cubano was so delicious I ordered it both times.  The restaurant has beec renovated and has a cool vibe.  The prices are reasonable with a wide variety of options.  I will continue to be a regular here!,1
"Very nice off the strip Las Vegas condo style accomodations.  The pool, rec room, and gym are very nice.  Customer service is always great and rooms are very well kept.  Highly recommended for families",1
Amazing everything.......food... 2 thumbs up!   Service from Tanya  was super!!,1
I had a complete rack and pinion replacement on my 2006 Acura TL. Chris (manager) was very courteous and helpful. Also allowed me to see the leakage when it was on the rack. Also included was a front end alignment. My Acura now rides like it's brand new. Highly recommend this shop.,1
"Had a wonderful hair cut with Lauren! I called in this morning got in right away with the help of a most kind receptionist. I've been trying to grow out my hair so I've avoided the salon for  very long time so I was a little nervous while waiting for my appointment. However, Lauren put me right to ease. She was so nice and as we talked about my haircut, she obviously knew so much about styling, care, etc. Much more than anyone else I've been to (Allure, Timothy Johns, and more). She does a great job with incorporating what you want while also being very honest about what will look best with your face shape. My hair looks so much more healthy now and she preserved the length so well! My bangs are also much more blended and my layers look beautiful! All feats considering that I have wavy coarse hair. Best 35 dollars I've spent in a while :)",1
Came home to find a flooded back yard with water flowing into the street. They were able to come out within the hour and fixed the issue at a reasonable price - would definitely use them again in the future,1
Great Phoenix place to enjoy coffee and pastries.,1
Amazing service and food. I dine there minimum 2 times a week. Excellent service all the time and the environment is very warm and welcoming. Their food is excellent.,1
"I have to give it 5 stars for what it is and what I ate. My guy server really didn't understand me and in turn, I have no idea what he was ranting about. Something about fried rice, which I had no interest in at the time, something about a prime rib buffet, Honestly, I do not know, but we got the right food and it was on point!  We originally were taking food to go. Our kind gentleman server informed us that the roasted duck was going to be another 20 minutes, my husband wanted that duck,  Bad! So we waited and ordered food to eat in, in the mean time. We ordered won ton soup with pork belly instead of duck, we also ordered pork ribs. and fish balls. Before the food got there, I realized we didn't not have enough cash for my husbands hunger and cravings. My husband orders food like he's on death row.  I proceeded to go to BOA , just down the road. (It's cash only) OK, so by the time I came back, my husband and my 6 year old daughter decided since they ate all the pork belly that they needed to order another one before I got there. They were raving about how great it was, my husband was in a pig heaven sort of a trance and my daughter was hoarding pork on her side of the table. Seriously, my husband was in awe of the pork belly. I have never seen him so excited and patiently waiting his duck. ""Ingrid, please come look at the pork with me??"" ""No. Andrew, I can see the pork from here."" Look at it, look at it, please!!""? ""It's OK, I can see it, Andrew."" That was our bbq banter. He finally gave up and decided to go stare at the glass of hanging meat and drool. If you cant tell, he really loved that pork belly!! And he was right to love it. It had a perfect crispy skin, tasty pork and not overly fatty.  The fish balls with curry sauce were good. We had to get 2 orders because my daughter did not want sauce. We ended taking most of them home. They were good, just not great. The soup was a super large portion and was pretty good, clean tasting and the noodles and won tons were not soggy and pretty perfect. My daughter wanted rice so we got a small side of rice and they brought out some kind of duck sauce. I absolutely loved that sauce and the rice was perfectly cooked. By the way, the lady who brought out the rice was so kind and polite. To go we ordered the 3 meat combo for 12.99, I believe.  Since my husband realized it did not come with rice, he ordered a duck and rice combo for 6.99. Needless to say, yes this is a pretty inexpensive place, but the fact that my husband has no self control when it comes to pork, our bill was about 49.00 dollars, 10 dollar tip, but we had so much food, enough for his late night munchies and lunch AND dinner the next day. It was an excellent value. We definitely will be back. It was yummy!!",1
"I have never stayed at this hotel before and boy have I been missing out.  First, when we walked into the lobby of the hotel I immediately noticed that it felt really clean.  This is because the lobby is not situated near the casino.  It is located on the first floor and the casino is on the second floor.  I will have to say that the individual who checked us is was not to nice or cheerful, I don't think he was enjoying his job that day!  When we got into our room we noticed that our room was decked out in movie memorabilia although I never heard of the movie (The boy who rode a dolphin) don't exactly remember the name!!!  oops  Anyways, I love the spaciousness of the room, we did not feel as if we had to stumble over eachother in order to walk around the room!!!  The first night we arrived we went down to the buffet cause we had a coupon!  I will tell you that this was the nicest buffet that I have been to.  The food was amazing and fresh!!  I would go back to this buffet in a heartbeat.The gambling at the hotel is pretty cool!  They have an area called the pleasure pit.  They have girls dancing on pools around the blackjack tables.  I know you might think that this is kind of sleazy but the girls that are dancing make sure to keep it ""PG,""  I did not find it to be offensive.  Overall, our experience at this hotel was quite enjoyable and I know that I will be going back, real soon!!!!",1
What a great find for lunch! I had the chicken nachos with a drink for $6.99! The nachos were fully loaded and so good! Great lunch special. I also tried the Pastor Taco ... bomb! I highly recommend you check them out. The staff was very friendly and we got our foo fast.,1
Awesome crew and always friendly. Subs are fresh and hot every time. Owner Vinney is a great guy also and very friendly. Keep doing what you are doing.,1
"As a vegetarian, it's hard to eat at burger places but  this place has a great salad and fries cooked separately. Very crispy amazing fries! The two people I was with loved their burgers. All-around good, quick meal.",1
This was the first apartment I ever moved into. We were looking for a nice apartment with good prices which is usually hard to find. This place is one of the nicest places for the price you pay to live here. Swimming pools and a gym and great staff! Shay and Tiffany are always so sweet to me every time I go down to the office and they are so helpful with any questions I have. Overall a great place to stay :)Rylee Watson,1
"Read online that this was a must go if you are there on a Wednesday. They post on social media a $5 chicken and waffle meal for that week. I assume any way that meal is prepared is a Win. So not only are they driving business by bringing in folks for a very reasonable price, but their food is really good. The original chicken is very good, a good fry with some heat to bring. Definitely recommend",1
"I'm giving ThirdSpace five stars even though I have never yet consumed food here. Never yet does not = never will. In fact, I have been to ThirdSpace a number of times in the past (first for coffee, once for a photo shoot, another time for drinks) and fully intend to continue visiting.ThirdSpace is truly unique in that it's a total community. A miniature community, but a community nonetheless. You've got your main hub (the bar) encircled by a bunch of cool little ""huts"", each one with its own featured attraction.One of the huts is a coffee shop. One of the huts is a tattoo parlor. One of the huts is a hair salon of some sort. It's just super diverse and the spirit is super cooperative. It's everything you'd expect from a Grand Ave. establishment.You've also got the added pleasure of regular events at the main bar. Plenty of interesting (live) music and DJs, plenty of seating indoors and out, and plenty of intriguing local art covering the interior walls.Service has always been great. Even my first visit, which featured a very confused barista who couldn't even seem to locate the coffee beans was a positive one by simple virtue of the girl's positive attitude and general state of kindness despite the confusion!(For the record, I've heard really good things about their coffee; I think I just managed to catch a poor newbie barista alone in the wild without appropriate supervision. I'll definitely be going back for a second attempt soon!)ThirdSpace does a wonderful job of incorporating all the most positive and powerful elements of the Grand Avenue experience within its little community ""walls"". If you haven't been by for a visit, you should definitely go.Choose a night where you're feeling unrushed, then go and relax for a while. You won't be disappointed. Very highly recommended.",1
This place is very misleading it looks small from the outside but it's huge they have a walk in the cigar section with a wide verity of cigars different price ranges it's pretty amazing,1
"Love, Love, Love ....House Seats! I have been a member for 3years and I can not say enough for the great staff!!! It's worth the cost of the membership. Being that I am a grad student, it is my source of entertainment. I attend concerts, plays or sport events  every week,  and without them I would not beable to attend these events!!! When you buy a membership..it is the gift to yourself..that keeps on giving..every time you push...The button.    So get a membership ... Push that button.... and just enjoy yourself!!!!!",1
"I needed to tow my truck because I got a flat tire. I called them early in the morning and by 11am they were ready to have them meet me. I spoke to Lauren, she gave me an amazing rate:) I like how prompted they were. Super fast service and at an affordable price. Thank you Lauren & Quik Pik I will definitely be recommending you or using u again for future service",1
My family has been going to Dr. Truman for three years now. The new office is in a great location and is very nice. I would recommend Dr. Truman to anyone in need of braces. My teeth are beautiful and Dr. Truman made my braces experience go by fast. The wait was worth it and my siblings will go to Truman as well in the future.,1
Nu Nails has the most beautiful tile and granite inside Thierry salon. That ladies are extremely nice ( if you are nice to them lol ) and the location it prim for everyone. I highly recommend this salon.,1
"When it comes to Mediterranean food, snacks and desserts, ADONIS is the go to place. The staff are friendly. They welcome you and assist you in what you are looking for. Baklava selection is widest. You can mix and match to suit your taste and preference. Great for big and small gatherings! They have a wide selection of cakes too!Want a huge selection of middle eastern breads of all kinds? You'll find it at Adonis!They have a sit down place for meals too just like at Whole Foods! Just like big supermarkets, they have everything from frozen, fresh, canned, bakery, fruits, meat, fish, grains... And it's all under one roof! They have a huge parking lot at the plaza too!",1
"Matt Rosen was a pleasure to work with.  We were looking to purchase an investment property in Phoenix and found Matt on Yelp.  He was everything you could ask for in a Real Estate agent.  He always answered our calls, he was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and had a great understanding of the area and what we were looking for.  I would 100% recommend Matt.",1
"I love this place.  Been eating here for 8 years and has always been consistently good.  It is my go to Thai in Charlotte.  Some complain about wait time...it is take out, call ahead and they tell you estimated time.  I just always show up about 10 more minutes to be safe and food is always hot.",1
"I see Nicole and get cuts and color, always perfect wth lots of compliments from people!   The slaon ins clean and friendly, the stylists appear to be very talented.   Highly recommend!",1
This place was amazing! They were able to help me find a perfect tuxedo for a last-minute gala that I was invited to by my girlfriend. Rosa & George were great and they quite possibly saved me from having an upset girlfriend for weeks. Rosa also provided us with a shop that could provide my girlfriend with a dress for the event that we purchased.,1
Literally the best ice cream I've ever had! The location is great for me and the owner goes out of the way to may your ice cream experience perfect. They have really good coffee too. I love going here!,1
"I can't say enough good things about Adams! The entire process from sales to installation was customer-focused and top notch service! I'm a first-time home buyer and the HVAC was my first investment in a repair/upgrade. My unit was failing six months after buying the house and the service technicians mandated by the home warranty were lacking in customer service and unable to solve the problem. When it was finally determined that my system needed to be replaced with a bigger unit, I left the home warranty service provider and started my own research. I compared quotes from four different companies. The sales consultant I worked with from Adams, Marco Ferreira, was so knowledgeable about my technical issue and beyond helpful when it came to choosing a complete new system. I had a lot of questions with this being my first home and first HVAC experience. Marco never tired of answering my questions and did a great job educating me on brand reputation and models for my options.  His communication was professional and prompt - something I valued greatly after weeks of unsuccessful service technicians before Adams. He was conscious of my budget and very thorough when we discussed price, not only of the system, but the whole process. I was pleasantly surprised when he stopped by my home to check in on the install (even though he's not a service guy) - that's great customer care! The service team assigned to my project was led by Juan and I'm so thankful! He was polite, friendly, and always stopped to answer my questions when I was observing the work! He ran into messier ductwork than expected while working on my home and never hesitated - he simply tackled the project with the same focus on quality and timeline for completion! His team cleaned up nicely when they were finished and I feel confident the install was performed with excellent care because Juan is very knowledgeable about HVAC systems! Even after the install, Marco checked in to help me learn about my new thermostat and talk to me about energy efficiency and regular maintenance. His knowledge and friendly, professional attitude made this horrible experience as smooth as it possibly could've been! Highly recommend!",1
I have taken my pets to another banfield for years. The service level and friendliness of the staff between the two are totally different. I was ready to give up on banfield until I gave this location (which is a longer drive for me) a shot. I would definitely recommend this office.,1
These folks talked to CRA for me at no charge.  Nice!,1
I have been coming here for years. The French dip is great and so are their frys. The owner is very friendly and the staff is as well.,1
Excellent service at the bar from double D.  Probably the best drink I've had in ages.,1
Recently moved to Las Vegas area and looked for a good gun shop. Used Yelp to find Spartan Arms and I'm really glad I did. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. I wanted to buy my first Glock and Joey helped me with the background check and sale. Great salesman with great personality who actually made spending a few hundred dollars kind of fun. Will be going here for all my purchases and would recommend Spartan Arms to anyone !,1
"I've been meaning to try this bar out for a while now, but never really had a chance. My boyfriend and I stopped by two weeks ago and we were definitely surprised. It's really nice decorated. They're a lot of locals which makes it fun. The bartenders definitely know their alcohol which was refreshing to say the least. The manager/owner approached us and made sure to update us on upcoming events, which was a nice gesture. We will definitely be back!",1
"Generous portions, excellent prices, and delicious food! If you're looking for a quick place to grab a bite, this hole in the wall offers an insightful vision into the heart of Mexican cuisine. The staff is super friendly and welcoming to all.",1
"I have been following the GM of this location since he was at Firestone.  He moved to another Sun Auto before opening this location.  It was clear on the other side of town so I made the mistake of getting something fixed by someone else and regret it to this day.   I'm still dealing with issues.  Cameron, Jimmy & the rest of the team are not your typical auto shop staff.  They excel is customer service and don't unnecessarily charge you for things you don't need.  Everyone knows the story about charging women who don't know any better about cars.  You won't have to worry about that with this team.  They are honest to their core.  They are fair and know the foundation of what customer service is all about.  I won't make the mistake of going to anyone else again & will drive all the way across town to come here for it's worth the service I get!! I recommend to anyone and everyone to take their car here. You won't be disappointed.",1
"My girlfriends and I really enjoy this place! It's a nice play to go if you're wanting to relax & not dress up, or if you are wanting something a lil' fancier, so it's good for both! They have a great happy hour menu for drinks & food. There bruschetta's are delicious & I love that they keep them changing! We've always tried something new when we went whether it's an appetizer, entree, or dessert & it never disappoints! It's always so yummy! I would highly recommend this place!",1
"My absolute favourite restaurant I've ever been too. Friendly owners and staff, delicious food, comfortable environment. I love how you can come as you are and enjoy the best food around.",1
"Honor, Integrity, Knowledgeable, Professional, Friendly--all found at Spyder. I don't have to think about who to call next time; just call Spyder.We needed a new water heater and ended up with a new Rinnai tankless. They had a great deal. I can't say enough about how they kept their word on the work, price, schedule--everything. They were good about setting my expectations of inspections and helping us through the process of permits (so glad they took care of all that!). They are all good. I hope I don't need them any time soon, but if/when I need any of their services, I know they'll come through for me. Thank you.",1
"I absolutely love the Paris hotel.  I was very impressed with the marbled bathrooms, cozy beds and overall decor.  Throughout the hotel the decor makes you feel like you are literally in Paris.  We purchased one of their signature Air Balloon Glass jar's since my last one broke.  You can purchase them at one of their signature bars and they will put a drink inside, or you can purchase one from their gift shop.",1
"Just got back from Frost Bites Shavery....WWWWWOOOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!It's 108 outside, I was in need of a light treat. I was working hard at work (or hardly working?) when I came across the perfect scoring on Yelp. I  talked my co-worker into leaving work early and going to Frost Bites Shavery with me (yolo!). I am glad I did! So delicious! I got the green tea with mochi on top. I was a little scared to add the condensed milk on it, but I will try next time when I am feeling adventurous.I am so happy this is in the area that I live, I will be coming back often when I need a sweet treat. Its a little hard to spot, but its near the Del Taco in the parking lot of Smiths.It's light and refreshing and it does not melt fast. The owner mentioned its like ""cotton candy of  ice-cream/shaved ice"" and that's exactly what it is.You have to try it for yourself, it really is one of a kind!",1
"North of Brooklyn has brought the pizza of BK to TO perfectly. I tried the white pizza and the margarita, both were phenomenal. Our group got two full pies, well priced at $22 each. The margarita was all you can ask for, thin & perfectly crispy crust, fresh ingredients. Classic and delicious. Not usually a fan of white pizza, but it seriously blew me away. For real, the first time I've ever gone for a second slice of sauceless pizza. It was so good. Try it, you white pie haters.  Toronto, you've been blessed with some amazing za. Check it out.",1
"My husband and I are in slight disagreement. I say five stars and he'd likely give it a 4. I got the St. Louis ribs and they were absolutely awesome. A little heat l, smoke and a richness in flavor matched the perfectly tender meat. The fried green tomatoes were also super Delish. There is pimento cheese on them- the real deal- not the stuff in the jar and you get a nice fat juicy slice of pork belly on top. My husband felt the infamous fried chicken was perfectly moist inside and crispy on the outside, but sadly lacked some seasoning it seemed tonight. Though our bacon salted fries were cold, the manager promptly brought us hot fries and took care of it. The service was stellar and the ambiance was cool. Expect it to be a little noisy, because it's popular, folks sit close together and it has a great bar. Total bill for one appetizer, two cocktails, two entrees and one side was 118 dollars and in the land of good food in Vegas that's an average price. I'd very much enjoy checking this out again!",1
"Love, love, love this place! I'm a huge fan of Bad Owl in Henderson, and I can honestly say this place stole my 1st place spot for coffee, boba, and ice cream!",1
"HILTON INVESTORS CONFERENCE at the Hilton Grand Vacations on the Las Vegas StripSunday, Aug 4, 2019 @ 2:30pm - 4:30pmTalking about the royal treatment! From Trump Int Hotel to the Hilton Grand Vacations Resort Las Vegas Strip is only a mile stretch; yet, I am chauffeur in a Mercedes party van equipped with flatscreen & leather lounger. At destination, more pampering with coffee, danish, juice, snacks, etc. I am now fully re-hydrated, sober and alert!Next, a get to know one on one chat with one of Hilton representatives - who felt more like a newfound friend than a sales rep - follow by a well-polished key presentation on timeshare from one of Hilton's CEO/ former television host.  A dynamic speaker!  She gets to the crust of human endeavor!  Not boring at all.  I receive a tour of HILTON Grand Vacations' 2-3 bedroom penthouse.  Impressive!  I am surprised to learn that the Hilton consortium own half of Vegas.The $500 per night Mandarin Oriental Hotel (Las Vegas Strip, Aria campus) now transformed into the affordable $250 per night HILTON Waldorf Astoria.  Trump International Hotel also own by Hilton Grand Vacations.  THEY MADE ME AN OFFER I CANNOT REFUSE: Free 5 nights stay at their HILTON CONRAD MALDIVES UNDERWATER HOTEL:  The Muraka! World's first!  A $15 million dollar project, 16.4ft below the surface of the Indian Ocean. My parents skirmish and refuse the investment opportunity; I will have to go on my own at the next presentation.",1
Mexican food lovers rejoice! La Tamalera is an awesome place to grab an authentic bite without breaking the bank. Fish Tacos were cooked to perfection and all the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor. Barbacoa came in a very generous portion and was absolutely delicious. Will happily go back to try the Tamales!,1
"I'm mainly impressed by the cactus garden. I love that it's unique to the area for tourists and it is very well maintained. I think it's a cool give back to the community that Ethel M puts so much effort into the gardens. The Christmas lights are really well done and the closest kids here will ever get to a Zoo Lights experience that other cities do. It doesn't hurt that after walking the gardens that there is delicious chocolate inside. The chocolate is quite pricey, but I just grab a piece or two and it isn't too bad.",1
"CALLING ALL CACTOMANICS: This is the best place in the valley to see such a diverse landscape of cacti, succulents, and desert wildflowers!!! There's also plenty of wildlife also enjoying the garden so don't be surprised to see butterflies, squirrels, birds, and other desert dwellers hanging around. Events here are always spectacular, especially ones with live music, it can cool off a bit in the evenings during nonSummer months though so pack an extra layer. Visit or join the garden as a member and get extra perks like members only hours and events. We love bringing nonlocals and locals alike to explore what beauty our desert offers~",1
"I really don't understand what another reviewer meant by the potato tacos being bad, they were excellent! Had a friend try one of them and she loved it as well. They were cooked perfectly and the sauce in the tacos had a good flavour and really complimented the tacos.   Also not sure why the other reviewer complained about using store-bought tortillas. This isn't some crazy authentic mexican place in the barrio that has homemade everything...not surprised by the tortillas at all. Also had the homemade lemonade and it had a really good flavour and nice tartness. Will totally be going again to try more things. Highly recommended!",1
"I have been using Darren Walters as my chyropractor for about 4 years now. He is the best chyropractor around. He always takes the time to help me out, even on unscheduled visits when I'm really hurting. He takes the time to help me get back in line, so I can continue with my day. He's really helped me and my business out by doing so.",1
"3rd time in and it's still delicious! Maybe I ought to try a different menu option, but the sweet potato fries and chzburger are my go to.",1
"I had my system installed a few weeks ago, and I decided to wait and see what the monitoring service was like before I gave a review. First, Jim arrived on time to show us the system he offers and to walk our home and give us security tips. His demeanor was friendly and sincere. He showed us all of our options and we decided to have the system installed within the next two days. The installer himself was punctual and he trained me how to use the alarm panel. Shortly after the system was installed, the monitoring station called to introduce themselves, and get information and do a small survey as to how the installation went. I know up to this point this sounds generic, but this is where I was impressed... I accidently set off the alarm, and within 5 seconds the monitoring center called me. I KID YOU NOT 5 SECONDS! Having been robbed before, I can tell you I really appreciated this. This whole transaction with Jim at JPG has been the easiest and smoothest ever. Additionally, I noticed that there is another review that admonishes the use of a third party monitoring service, but I do not mind it - especially since they contacted me so quickly after I set off my alarm.Now I truly get a good nights sleep :)",1
"Excellent food and service! Jalapeño grits are amazing! Had the meatloaf another visit and LOVED it! Good bloody Mary's too! Their menu features different than the regular "" bar food menu"" and it is a well hidden secret in Grafton. However, I drive by daily on my way home from work and the place is usually very busy, so maybe not so much a secret. I think I'll go back tomorrow",1
Great food and service. Super family friendly and quick. We are there once a week and the food is always good. My kids love the mango lasses. The naan is very traditional. Definitely recommend this restaurant for families.,1
"I go to AZ Bread Company almost weekly with my mom for brunch. The food and service are always great. We love the family atmosphere-- all of the employees know all of the regulars, and it's really friendly. It's just an all-around great breakfast and lunch place. I also really like that they have a punch card where you can earn a free meal.",1
"My husband and I started seeing Dr. Couvaras in 2016, and it was one of the best decisions that we have ever made. The office and staff make you feel so welcomed and they end up becoming like family.  We had been trying for a baby for over five years, and while it's definitely not an overnight process, you get to the root of infertility and underlying problems with Dr. C. If you put in the hard work it will be so worth it! We are now expecting our twins that are due in August :)",1
"I was skeptical.  Had been looking for a ""true"" Italian coffee shoppe but came across this.  The SF vanilla powder is yummy.  Nice view.  Friendly service.",1
"What a great experience. I was on a business trip and wanted to get my brows done. I noticed Luxe with great reviews and decided that I can also get a much needed haircut as well since it was a salon. When I got there, the brows option was out the door since the esthetician was already gone for the day. Eduardo greeted me and told me that Niloo was fantastic and for me to come back however he was able to work on my hair. Eduardo was amazing and genuine to talk to. He asked about my hair, how I normally maintain it and determine how he was going to cut it based on my habits. I loved that he personalized it for me. He made suggestions on colors and I was sold. So at the last minute, I decided at add on colors which again he accommodated and helped me with selecting the best colors to fit me.  I've been to many salons and have never had anyone make me feel so cared for. I wish I can bring him back to Kauai with me.",1
"Amazing experiences!We used to go to the Subway closest to us on Windmill and Las Vegas Blvd and then it closed suddenly and then we went to the one on Blue Diamond, see my other Subway review for that mess of an experience so I Googled and we found this one.First experience was great, they have a new Mozz there and its super tasty.The restaurant itself is clean, comfortable and the people making the sandwiches are super friendly...but...our 2nd and 3rd experience here (so it took me some time to find the right Subway on Yelp) was the best, Richard was our sandwich maker, he is friendly and engaging and just a true delight!    He makes sure that you really get what you want and doesnt get upset if you want extra sauce or what not like the guy from our last Subway used to...This is our new sandwich place to go, also we heard that the owner wanted to thank us for making the switch!   wow.We eat at Subway 2-3 times a week  :)      Thanks!",1
Stopped by here on a night out. The prices are good and not outrageous like typical strip pricing. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had as well. Friendly staff that even came out and dropped the food off our order as we grabbed a seat away from the restaurant. I would recommend this place to anyone going out to the t mobile arena or around there.,1
I cannot more highly recommend Quality Granite! From the sales to the installation a top notch business that takes care of their customers. They exceeded my expectations at every turn. Thank you so much Quality Granite!,1
This place is awesome! I had the drunken noodles with chicken and it was so good and I had plenty for leftovers for the next day which I was excited about! My fiance had the noodles with chicken and he was happy with his choice as well. The service was great and and the restaurant was clean. I'll definitely be returning soon!,1
"Great Thai food! Not a lot of seating inside, mostly takeout. There is a small patio.  Loved the red curry dish!",1
We ended up here by accident & were pleasantly surprised. It was a busy night but the server was excellent & the food was delicious. My favorites were the lasagna & the flourless torte...soooo good. The Freshly made pasta was so worth it.,1
My husband and I eat here every Sunday after church. The food is always DELICIOUS and the staff is equally great! The servers are always professional and courteous but the highlight for us is seeing Kiarra's beautiful smile greeting us when we walk in. Her personality is infectious!!! Keep up the good work!Sheila & Troy,1
Food was really great but service was a little slow. Everyone was super nice but it took quite a long time to get the food.,1
These guys are awesome fast and even opened early for me!  I feel like I have a new phone.  Don't go anywhere else !,1
Best Thai food around. Pineapple curry is my life. I work in station square and order it probably once a week!,1
I got a mooyah burger and sweet potatoes fries .  Both delish and I enjoyed strawberry banana shake. The only problem is that the workers r too overly enthusiastic repeatedly and kinda have to wait long for food which shouldn't considering fact it's a fast food restaurant. I hope it's because workers are still learning,1
"I almost never give five stars.  This review is based on one visit.  I got a couple of items to go.  My wife, who has spent time in Paris, said they were just like what you get in Paris.  I am something of a foodie and the pastry was spot on.  In fact about a half-hour after I had finished it the wonderful flavor was still gently on my palate.  What a great finish to a meal.  I plan to go back and try some other Items.  It is a bit hard to find.  I you go past Bricktops restaurant and turn right it is a few steps and on the left.",1
"I used to think photography was simple, until I met true professionals.  Tim and Rose take the time to get to know you and more specifically what feeling you want to capture before they get to a location. We have used this team for headshots and family photos and were delighted with the results.  Furthermore, other family members have used them for their big day events.  What impressed me is their ability to scout fun locations, as well as putting in time to get to know a recommended site. And funny! Rose is wonderful at herding large groups of people and keeping everyone amused.  I've also attended fundraiser events where they have volunteered their services. It's fun to watch them work! I highly recommend them.",1
Dr Rosenstein is the BEST!! My doctor of 15 years died so i have been on the search for a new one. Dr Rosenstein actually listens to your concerns. He is very intelligent but doesn't act like hes smarter than everyone else lol.  I have severe back pain for about a year now and every doctor blew me off but not him. He did x-rays that same day in his office and ordered an MRI. He also had me do blood work in his office as well which was nice. Dr Rosenstein actually has a conversation with you as if you guys know eachother rather than treating u like just a number. For me it is important for a doctor to have a good bedside manner and Dr Rosenstein definitely has that! He also gave me my sleeping meds with refills so u dont have to come back every single month. He made me feel very comfortable and i feel fully confident that he will find a solution to my pain! He is literally one of the best doctors i have ever been to. I would give him more than 5 stars if i could.  The office staff is very friendly as well!,1
Trimmed and skinned palms.  Great job!   Was able to be there at the time I requested. Left the yard cleaner than when they arrived.  Thankyou so much!,1
"Fantastic food!  Both the hot dogs and the burgers are to die for, as are the fresh cut fries!!  Excellent service, great variety and creativity in the menu, and great price!  One of our favorite local haunts.  Very inventive menu and the service is fantastic.",1
"We recently took my son here for his birthday since he is a bbq fanatic! It was our first time and our server let us know a little about the place and the food which was nice. The corn bread was great and unlimited although we only needed one basket with our q rolls and meals. We ordered the pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad and mac n cheese on the side and my son had the ribs. I have to say I would probably get the ribs next time as well, the sandwich was ok but the sides we couldn't get enough of! By the end my son could barely fit his complimentary birthday dessert! Our server was absolutely wonderful and while we felt the food was pretty good the service we received was truly amazing and the best we've ever had. We will be coming here for many more special occasions :)",1
"The bouquets are always gorgeous no matter what is ordered. When I call in to place an order, Juliet or Diane always ask about the person who is to receive the delivery and what they like and if there is anything specific I want. I will usually ask for a specific flower or color and let them use their imagination. They think outside the box so that your gift is really something special and not just the Teleflora standard round arrangement. Most importantly, the flowers are always fresh and last a really long time. This is the only florist I use.",1
"Dozens of people pour through town and tell me, ""We just got married. Elvis did it."" Still not used to hearing the stories, but recently, my college friends came into town for a bachelor party. The groom dressed as Elvis the entire Saturday evening we went out. This wasn't my idea, but theirs. Elvis still lives in Las Vegas. Thanks to the Graceland Wedding Chapel for keeping his memory alive and well.",1
"I have seen a lot of Vegas shows (O, Mystere, etc) and this one takes the top prize!!!We were jokingly going to take in Thunder Down Under to get our fill of hot guys, but never fear!  Le Reve does not disappoint! There are about 50 hunks with amazing muscles to gawk over here!Graceful theatrics and a beautiful, intimate feeling sitting in the circular theatre. I was blown away by the scenery, the lighting, the music and of course, the dancing in the water. What a thrill to experience this show. Literally everyone around us left saying ""this was the BEST show we have ever seen!!!"" GO SEE IT! What are you waiting for!?!",1
"Absolutely amazing! We spend 4 hours here and racked up quite a bill but it was a great evening with amazing food and amazing service. The seasonal menu offers lots of interesting options. The homemade bread is wonderful and the cheese board is delicious. Also delicious is the cold corn soup, the eel which is one of their signature dishes and the duck which is large enough on it's own as a meal. Most other plates are good for sharing as they are small so you can try lots of different things. The desserts were delicious and very interesting. We had the blueberry which has candied mushrooms, it actually works together well and the buckwheat chocolate dessert which was so amazing and interesting. We also had a few cocktails which were delicious as well. The service was truly amazing and the staff was so nice explaining the foods and giving us recommendations and always made sure we had water. Superb experience!",1
The Chile Colorado burrito is bomb. Get it! The enchiladas look amazing. Never tried them though. Building is super cool.,1
"This place was outstanding.  Went on a Friday night for dinner. Ambiance was great and nice live music.  The menu is unique and adds excellent diversity to the AZ dining scene.  Every dish we had was a hit, app through desert.  Cocktail was fresh and tasty.  The front of the house and wait staff were very pleasant. We will definitely return.",1
"Cabela's is THE go-to place for everything outdoorsy. The store is clean, well stocked, and it's easy to find someone to help you.",1
"I can't say enough about David and his service. My mom took her Yukon in for a smog check. It initially didn't pass but David totally helped her and explained in detail what needed to be done. He was honest in his suggestions, didn't try to go for the most expensive fix only the one that was needed. You can tell he is very honest. I recommend this shop for your car problems. If he can convince my mom that he's honest and have her believe his advice.... trust me he's honest.. DAVID is the man... thanks guys..",1
We get the pork belly table BBQ every time! The value is really good and good portion for 2. The side dishes are good and they refill them if you ask. The soup that came with the combo is really nice and I recommend to choose the tofu soup.,1
"This humble spot has THE BEST PHO in the Valley...The price is perfect, portions perfect and the I eat here 4 out of 5 days in my workweek when I'm in town.I'm always super impressed with this operation - you would drive by it otherwise.",1
"I only went to one bakery to taste for my wedding cake - my new hubs actually is not a cake fan so I knew I had to be selective as I really wanted him to come and I knew he wouldn't make it to more then one tasting so I had to nail it! I selected Honeymoon Sweets because I knew that Whole Foods offered their desserts, and Whole Foods and I are good friends and I trust his opinion. There are some poor reviews out there, but we decided to roll the dice and wow was I glad that we did. We had nothing but great service from them - the phone service was a little sketchy like they were multi-tasking while talking to me, but really I can't fault them because I do the very same thing at work. What matters is that they nailed our cake. I actually came in with a sketch of how I wanted my cake to look, which is I think kind of a risky proposition versus going with a tried and true design. The sales lady checked with the cake designer and they said they could do my design, and best of all, with just buttercream frosting to support the design, which is great because fondant is nasty and $$$. So we tasted all the flavors and decided on lemon cake with raspberry mousse (yum) and chocolate cake with coconut cream (double yum). I actually changed the chocolate flavor to red velvet a few weeks before the wedding because unbeknownst to me a lot of people don't like coconut, and the red velvet was a total hit. So how did the design turn out??? ( I will post a photo). AMAZING. I was so nervous as I arrived at the venue and we were taking pictures my thoughts kept drifting over to the cake. I was a little freaked out thinking how it would look, again, only because of the few negative reviews, not because of anything I experienced. So finally I grew some cajones and went to look at the cake. Holy cow it was awesome. It was better then I imagined. After a few friends posted pics on facebook tons of people commented on how cool the cake was. So huge high five to Honey Moon Sweets. We did not have a cake with our package so we had a choice, and we are glad we chose you. The cake vendor is one you don't get to see or thank at your wedding, so I want to thank your staff and your cake designer for knocking this one out of the park!",1
"Poolman just remodeled our Community pool, deck and spa.  Working with Tricia Booker and Matt Kwasny was a wonderful experience.  The project was on time, the work was top quality and the pricing competitive. We highly recommend Poolman for your remodel!",1
Highly recommended ! Excellent service!I've showed Bobby a picture and he knew exactly what I wanted and even better than I was expected! Bobby took his time to cut my hair and at the end he dried and styled it so beautifully. I am a very picky person about my hair and Bobby is the one who I trust .Thank you,1
"This place is awesome!!!I went here with two of my friends and between the three of us, we tried a bunch of dishes. The food is excellent! And the owners are pretty cool, too. They came out of the kitchen to check on us (no waiter service) and talk a bit. The woman told us that it takes her two days to make the fresh hummus from scratch, because she does everything, down to soaking and grinding the beans. I hadn't had falafel in a long time, and the ones served here were awesome! They tasted just like I remember them. Mmmmm!The prices are decent, too. My falafel meal was under $5, though you can also get other items, more food for more.This is my new favorite greek place to eat. :)",1
This is my second massage with Lily. I can't say enough good things about her technique. I wanted to relax and that is exactly what she did for me. I'm ruined!!! I love the long sweeping movements over large muscle groups. When she found an area that needed attention she would work it for a minute then sweep the large area again. It was pure heaven. I can't wait to come back.,1
Postnet came thru for my wife who is an educator with CCSD. They had a real issue with printing curriculum that was desperately needed for a program they needed at their school when other resources were not available. They delivered as a printing specialist and the final product was amazing! Don't think Postnet is all about a mailbox or shipping as their real specialty is custom printing whatever you need. Thanks Team!,1
"Breakfast sandwich was fantastic.  Cappuccino, too. I passed on the free hotel breakfast to find a real one and am so glad I did!I happened to find the Marigold Kitchen using Yelp.  It was a perfect breakfast at 7:00 AM to begin my drive to Minneapolis.  I'm leaving with an Americano for the road.",1
"Went on vacation and ran into some car troubles. You wouldn't expect that from a 2017 Q60 however it happened. From the moment I drove up, I was well taken care of. My service advisor was knowledgeable and friendly. Totally erased the stigma I have against service departments. He wrote my car up and I was off to the waiting area.And what a area. It's full of comfortable leather chairs, delicious bite size snacks and a fridge full of a mix of water a pop. Just what I need to enjoy my favorite shows on the flat screen tv while I await the verdict of my car.Once my vehicle was ready, I received a convenient message since I was roaming the dealer at that time. My advisor outlined exactly what my car needed, pricing and even walked me out to the car so I could see first hand. Talk about service. I even received a follow up call a few days later asking how my experience was and if my car was running properly.If I'm in the area and need servicing, without a doubt ill be back again.",1
"Fabulously smart and GREAT bedside manner. He listens and appreciates knowledge levels of your own self healthcare. Adds to it and explains everything. We were very pleased that he is a straight shooter, not fancy and did not create ""white coat"" blood pressure spike.  We felt at was with his investigative approach to overall heath issues rather than the symptoms.",1
The BEST massage I've ever had!! Thank you Lily I walked in today with a massive amount of shoulder & next pain of which I no longer have. Front office staff was very nice & welcoming as well.,1
"Michelle was absolutely fantastic, the food was great and wonderful atmosphere.   Will definitely come back when back in Phoenix.",1
"Even with being the last a$$hole customer of the day, I still received excellent customer service!!  Great quality pedicure and didn't feel rushed out of there. Thanks to the staff for taking care of their customers. Haven't been in here in quite some years and happy to see the same owner. Place is very clean and staff is very nice.  Great salon to go to especially since there is so many to choose from.",1
"So friendly! Driving from Charlotte to Atlanta and discovered I might have a problem tire. They got me in without an appointment and thoroughly examined the problem, found nothing wrong, then sent me on my way without charging me. Awesome!",1
"This is the best, most affordable nail salon I have been to in AZ! No appointment necessary, they ALWAYS get you right in no matter how busy they are. I have never had to wait here. Ben is the best nail technician. He takes his time and is very gentle. I usually went to Ben for a gel manicure and my manicure would last 3 or more weeks which was amazing. My nails never chipped or cracked when Ben did my nails. I have not found a better place than 7 day! I highly highly highly recommend 7 day to anyone and everyone in the Tempe area!",1
If you haven't tried this place you are crazy ! !!! Great food ! Great service!!! Absolutely love it!!!!,1
Went in for dessert with a friend after a dinner party down the street and was not disappointed. We split the chocolate ganache and chocolate terrine--no such thing as too much chocolate. The ganache was white chocolate with a hint of lemon--my fav of the two. Will definitely be returning for dinner!,1
"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I have been here over 7 times with my husband and we try something new each time and everything is delicious. The service is great each time and the food comes quickly. If you want to catch a game, this place has televisions and everywhere so you don't have to miss any game. It does get busy on big game days or fight nights so reserve a table. If you come here and you won't regret it and you'll turn into a regular.",1
"If you are new in Charlotte check this place out! Everything is local and very yummy. It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for... definitely top 3 restaurants I have been to in Charlotte, nc",1
Great first time in! Few weeks ago we celebrated a friends birthday party at Gusto for drinks and apps/meals. We had a large party and all staff was kind and accommodating! Food and drinks were delicious!,1
"With all the negatives reviews, it sure put a questions if this was a good choice.  You pay for what you get and it's not bad. Very pleasant stay. The only things is the Buffett was just ok.",1
"If you claim to be a fan of the cinematic masterpiece that is the film ""A Christmas Story"" you HAVE to visit the house.  It is the exact location for all the exterior shots from the movie.  The interior has been gutted and restored to match the film.  Across the street is a wonderfully appointed gift shop and museum.  A visit is itself a ""Major Award""",1
This is my favorite place to eat!  We've been to 3 different Oreganos and the ambiance is the same at all 3 locations which makes it an appealing place to go.  We will be back for sure!,1
"Bought a Springfield pistol here, price was great and the owner was helpful and knowledgeable. They showed me how to clean it and the buying process was super easy. I'd recommend this shop for sure.",1
"I love their version of the elote corn aka. mexican corn with mayo, butter, that mexican cheese and some spice. It's delicious, it's near the house, and when I crave it I can get it. Unfortunately, it does take a whole lot of time waiting for the food because this place is always packed. It's worth the wait though.",1
"Fun little ice cream stop. What could beat 3 desserts in one? House-made and Toasted marshmallow (to your perfect degree of liking) + a macaron (not to be confused with the coconutty macaroon) + two scoops of your favorite house-made ice cream. Yum!! The ice cream is quite smooth and creamy while still light on the palate. So many great flavors to choose from including passion fruit sweet cream, cookies 'n cream, coffee and many more. I really enjoyed this place and can't wait to go back!",1
"I was a regular at the blaze pizza across the street from this place for a couple years before I finally decided to try this place. This will definitely be my new go to place for pizza. Sorry blaze pizza. The crust was crispy, they add a lot of toppings, and the pizza was delicious. The staff was nice and the place was clean too. Will definitely come back here.",1
Haven't even used them yet and I love them just called to get their hours (it's 5:23am) and gal answered and I said oh I just wanted to see when you open. She said we aren't actually open but go ahead and come by if you need to drop something off!!!  great customer service!,1
Best tapas is town. The seviche is the best. Prices are not bad. Great service and location.,1
My 3 children and I had the pleasure of taking this tour with Tim and a great Aussie family.This otherwise long 4 hour ride was fun and entertaining. Tim kept us interested by providing us with tons of facts about AZ and joking with us the whole way.  We stopped for lunch at the Indian Reservation and did some light shopping.  The Grand Canyon was spectacular and Tim was so accommodating taking our pictures along the way.  Tim was the highlight of the trip.  He provided the visiting Australian family with tips on visiting Sedona and showed us some great things along the way.  He had a supply of water he kept encouraging us to drink. My daughter left our camera in the car and he graciously returned it that very night.  Thanks Tim and SouthWest for providing us with a great experience.,1
What a great place to take your pet! Wishing Dr. Driggers could be our family doc! We took our bearded dragon in for a check up before boarding while on vacation. Dr. Drigger and his assistant were very professional and knowledgeable and presented us with a print out of suggestions and proper habits for our beardie. Two thumbs up!,1
"Love this place. It's always busy, but I've never had to wait too long for my table. The quality of the meat is always good, and the service is prompt. Unless you just want to go crazy eating yourself to death at an AYCE place, the amount of food served here is adequate for any normal human being. I usually get the beef combos -- it's plenty food and includes steamed egg and tofu stew.",1
"Very satisfying! Burger was tasty and juicy! Loved it! The worker Enzo was very friendly, courteous, and provided recommendations that helped us choose the right burger. Definitely worth coming here",1
"You simply HAVE TO do this! Sign up on website to receive weekly menus on Wednesdays, place your order online Weds-Sat, & pick up your order on Mon. It's essentially healthy, organic, & vegetarian meal prep that's done for you. When you pick up your order, they send you off with your food labeled in mason jars inside insulated bag. I'm so excited I found Ingrid & Community Cuisine! I will def continue to be a weekly customer. Thanks for keeping the community healthy & giving this vegetarian some healthy, creative, & homemade meals!",1
"Amazing! Jake stayed late to fit us in, did an amazing job and was super fun and friendly! He definitely made the situation calm and enjoyable. Had a great time and the tattoo looks awesome! Thank you!",1
"This place deserves 5 stars for what they do. I have a mini golden doodle and was able to get a spot for their promotion - puppy (under 6 months) program. This means that all in, the surgery was going to cost $20 + tax!Prices aside, I have great confidence in THS as my mini poodle was neutered here. For those who worry about the mandatory green tattoo, it is barely visible after it heals. In terms of their facilities, it is basic but what you need. The doctors don't try to up sell you and have more experience with neuters and spays compared to a neighborhood vet.I would most definitely recommend the THS for their services (booster shots too!)",1
"Bit skeptical at first but once we were inside it was an amazing experience. We decided to sit at the bar for the view of the kitchen. We had three people so we shared two appetizers ( melt in your mouth scallops, the ahi), two light dishes (gnocchi, the squash linguini) and one entree (duck and omg the carrot purée) and everything was incredible and I can't pick a favorite. We were full before we started desserts but we got one each of the desserts anyway and they were all amazing, perfect consistency like your grandmothers baking with the exception of the lemon semifreddo which was nothing like anything I've had before. Everything we had was full of flavor and you could taste every ingredient he used. In addition to the food the team atmosphere there was what really made the experience over the top. Peaceful and comforting and exotic all at the same time.",1
"My husband and I went to this place once a few months ago and had our first avocado toast. It was amazing, well-priced, and had me wanting more. Yesterday evening, I went in after craving this toast for a few days and the worker was locking up just as I was walking up. She asked if I was coming there and I told her yes. She said it had been slow and they were closing early, but she would happily serve me. I was shocked because most places would have never done that! Not only that, she made me my avocado toast at 630P even though it's only served from 8A-11A! It hit just the right spot before we headed down to the strip and I'm going back for more today! TOP NOTCH SERVICE AND DELICIOUS FOOD. My husband has had the smoothies and enjoys them as well. Great local spot to support!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1
"I am only rating this a 5 based on the pizza served at Vina Pizza. I have not tried any other items on the menu.... But the pizza ...... OH the pizza is amazing!! It is made in the same vein as the Greek- owned pizza places in Calgary.... But I don't know if the owners are Greek or not.  I am not comparing it to Punchinella types of pizza this is good old pepperoni, hawaiian, house special kind of place. The crust is perfection, the toppings ample and the cheese golden. And what makes this place really good is the PRICE of the pizza. You could go a few blocks up the road to Nicks on Crowchild, and pay a significant amount more for a substandard pizza. Vina is a small cozy little place, clean and unpretentious. Make a reservation if you want to dine in. The place is always packed at dinner time.",1
"Super fun atmosphere, really good drinks, and suchhh good food. Definitely have a return costumer from me",1
"Thai Hut went under new management within the past year. The food is excellent. I would like to warn the general public, the spice level is high. The lady there felt bad for me because I was defintely phased by it. She brought out some Thai iced tea that really helped. She was such a pleasure to speak with. My brethren has stated that Thai Kitchen down the street has lost its glory and touch. This is true since their management has changed and their quality slipped. A lot of folks jumped on the Thai Kitchen bandwagon lately. I urge you to try Thai Hut. The food is great. The service is perfect and it just a nice quaint place to grab some dinner. I came here with my brother and father and we all enjoyed ourselves. I have some leftovers for dinner tonight and cannot wait to get home and eat them.",1
"Found out about this place from some of the guys at my jiu jitsu school.  Thought it would be a bunch of meat heads, but it's actually a really cool place for healthy food or a quick smoothie or protein shake on the go.  I'd say I like this better than protein house and will definitely be coming back.  Healthy food and fast",1
"Benefit Brow Bar @ South park is wonderful! I've been a Benebabe for a while now but never went to Brow Bar. Katie waxed & tinted my brows. Great atmosphere & licensed estheticians make sure you're taken care of. Very clean, no double dipping in the wax. If you get tint they do allergic spot test on you before even thinking about putting it on your brows. Definitely worth every penny! Don't forget to book you're appointment with Katie!",1
"Hash House a Go Go is an experience similar to a Las Vegas Show. Tourists have to go inside, but locals love their meals 24 hours a day at Hash House as well. Down the street from City Hall, many of the celebrities that live in Las Vegas can be found eating breakfast with press agents and talent managers inside the Plaza Casino's Hash House. Mayor Oscar Goodman's restaurant serving steak is directly above Hash House a Go Go. Today dozens followed us inside from the MLK Day Parade. Hundreds of hungry breakfast folks gathered at the Martin Luther King Jr. Day Parade the ended at Fremont Street near the Plaza Casino on Main Street. The plates are giant. The dishes are creative with the perfect taste.",1
"Fresh fish and delicate sushi at an AYCE? Fast and efficient service and pleasant servers.  Maybe not a ""five star"" restaurant but for a reasonable priced joint, 5 out of 5 stars.  Clients are mostly tables of 20 something's with a few families in the mix. It's a stat holiday today (Good Friday) and the place was packed with a lot of people waiting. Arrived at noon and was told a 1/2 hour wait for our table of 5. That was just about right. The food arrived promptly in random order. The salmon was thinly sliced and deliciously fresh. The kalbi ribs were perfectly done - tasty but not dripping in sauce. Lots of options for non-sushi types. Individual portions of noodles, soups and chicken teriyaki. Definitely will return.",1
"I was so pleased with the customer service at Bride Studio. This was one of the best experiences ever. The girls were so patient and helpful. I didn't feel pressured or rushed. They knew exactly what I was looking for and I was able to say YES to the dress. The boutique was nice and clean, large mirrors, beautiful designs on the walls, creative quotes ""You are beautiful just the way you are."" The vibe and the mood is everything a Bride To Be is looking for. They take pictures of you, offer lemonade and water, they make you feel special. It was very welcoming. I am so excited that I was able to leave there feeling accomplished. I was there for a few hours, trying on the same gowns multiple times, torn between two, they gave me all the time I needed. The gowns are affordable and unique. My wedding is in June of this year  yes a few months away and we were able to find the perfect gown, rush order it and guarantee that it would be here in a timely manner. What more could you ask for. I have been to several bridal boutiques and I've never been in love with a dress after trying it on but this place was meant to be. The gown that I wanted  was available in my size and could be rush ordered. I can't wait until it arrives... thank you so much Bride Studio, I am truly thankful.UPDATE!!! My gown arrived in less than two weeks as promised. I love it and I couldn't be more happier. Thank you Bride Studio for keeping your promise. I can't wait to wear my beautiful gown on my wedding day. Selene is the best, she knows her stuff. Thanks again for easing my stress after a horrible experience with Pearl Bridal. If I could give this boutique a million stars, I would. Can't wait to show off my pictures.",1
What a refreshing experience! I have never felt so confident at an auto mechanic in my life. There is no stress involved in taking your car to be repaired at My Honest Mechanic. They really do live up to the name. DeeDee was as friendly as could be and sweet as pie. She kept me informed about everything from beginning to end. I really felt like she shopped around for the best prices on parts and they charged a fair amount for labor. I am so happy to have found this shop. All of our vehicles will be serviced at My Honest Mechanic and I have already referred my friends.,1
April is amazing ! I went in for a hiker's massage and came out with every muscle relaxed. She was able to find a bunch of knots that I didn't even know existed until she pressed on them. She was firm and her experienced hands kneaded away at  my muscles until she was satisfied with the results. She's awesome and I'll be sure to come stop by again if I'm in Scottsdale.,1
If you're looking to pay for a veterinarian that just gives your dog hot dogs just  to like them or act like they care about your dog you can go to be VCA... Mind you there was like a 20 minute wait list when you go there ever since I've adopted both my dogs I've been going to this clinic he's reliable and always has been honest with me he tells me what should be done but let me make the decision I want to be done... They have discounts off on Fridays and Saturdays 4 shots.. They may be just a few dollars more than the Animal Foundation but its well worth it when it comes to time Animal Foundation two hours Animal House 20 minutes or less I would have to say less each time I visit has been less than 15 minutes recently my dog was sick and he was able to offer me everything at this facility...  the veterinarian is a different culture so i dont always  understand  him.. But what I do understand is that he is knowledgeable when it comes to your pet and is going to always offer his opinion when it comes to upselling for your dog's care remember this is a business this is not non-profit organisation that being said you have a right to say yes or no to the extra services.. And he doesn't make you feel guilty for it like my experience with the VCA had.... These are my furbabies I get to choose a treatment for them and choose who they go to I would choose knowledge and cost over how friendly somebody is to my dog... I continue to take my dogs here in fact I'm on my way there right now to get my dog updated on his shots...,1
Love the Coffee Pub. A great place for locals to hang out and we'll let the tourists stop by as well. Always great service and great food.,1
great service. the food was amazing. got complimentary pancakes from the manager. would definitely recommend and come again!!,1
"I think I found one of the only other places in the city to find a decent bagel outside of Bialy's. My friend and I were driving around Solon for lunch and he recommended D & R Bagels. I saw Boars Head deli meats in the case. The menu is expansive and very cheap. I had a turkey sandwich on multi-grain with muenster cheese. It was delicious. The meat was shaved and piled high. I prefer this arrangement because the texture of the meat is way better than Subway style frisbee-ish cold cuts. My friend had the pastrami and corned beef. He said it was good. I decided to only eat half the sandwich and try a bagel. This was one of the best ideas I have had in a while. The half a sandwich served as dinner tonight. The bagel was delicious. It is prepared the proper way bagels should be done. They boil them then finish them off in the oven. Nothing like a Panera Bread ""bagel"" that people always buy for work functions. Panera bagels are just big ass pieces of bread. I am pretty pumped to find this place!",1
"Simple snack outside of Merry Anns! Good for when you are out late in downtown Champaign. I tried the chicken taco! It's pulled chicken which I am not fond of, but the taste is good! The salsas are also tasty, which is super important for when I am eating Mexican cuisine. Friendly staff working the truck as well. Definitely a better choice when it comes to a late night snack!",1
"Place is small and cozy. Old school jars are used for lemonades and tea. The menu was my favorite. Everything is done exactly as the menu says it ""old school"". Nothing in their menu is fried. We started with the Gio salad which was served on top of sourdough bread. Very different and very tasty. We ordered chicken wings. 1 order has two large wings. They are stuffed with sausage. These were delicious. I would definitely order more next time. Last but not least the pizza was to die for. We created our own however they have a selection of specialty pizzas. Definitely worth the price!!",1
Michelle is awesome!!!!! She is a true professional. She makes our time so relaxing and productive.  Mireji had transformed my face! Thanks so much!!! Karen,1
Ballin'.  This place is really good for Mexican.  The homemade chips and salsa they give you as soon as you sit down are fantastic.  Everything is very well priced and delicious.  This is a great place.  Just don't start beef with any Steelers players that dine here (I'm looking over at your way Cedric Wilson).,1
"These guys ROCK!  When you enter this store and see the overwhelming beauty of all the jewels displayed before you, you immediately assume pretense, but there isn't any.  This is a group of guys who love great, quality stuff, and are eager to help.They have GORGEOUS jewelry for women.  And they carry some very unusual lines, like NightRider...very manly...for men.  Actually, once you get to know them, you know that all of them are manly men.  So there is this incredible irony that I just love!I attended a Girls Night Out event last night, and it was amazing!  I highly recommend the upcoming Fast Times, Fast Cars event for men!",1
"Fast delivery, great service, hot pizza! Better than pizza hut and dominos for sure.",1
"Maybe the best dinner we ever had?? Lol. Came here for a nice date. If you enjoy French food, this is probably the best in the city.Escargots in puff pastry: 11 out of 10. It's that good. The pastry, the sauce, just everything is out of this world. French onion soup: 9 out of 10. Wonderful taste, made to perfection. Best I've ever had and I've had a lot. Bone marrow: It was fine. I won't rate it because I'm not qualified to rate a delicacy such as this and it was my first time trying it.Duck confit: 8.5 out of 10 - delicious, fatty, crispy.8oz peppercorn filet: 8 out of 10 - I'm not a fan of ""saucy"" steaks but the cut and preparation was phenomenal. Gateau chocolat (chocolate cake): 11 out of 10. The best cake either of us have ever had in our lives. Tastes more like a moist brownie or pudding. Incredible. Service was good (not extraordinary).I have a feeling you can do no wrong at this restaurant.",1
"For me, this is a no-brainer because I've grown up with the Cleveland Museum of Art in my city and I have to say it is, without a doubt, one of the most wonderful experiences I've had.As you walk through the museum, you experience the world through the eyes of artists through the ages and you can see history pass before your eyes. From ancient Egypt, to Asia, past the Renaissance and all the way to Modern Art, you see the ages pass in all their colorful glory. In addition, recent renovations (such as the new Atrium where you could land a full Zeppelin,) as well as some of the new display areas make it just a treat to the eye. They also have a new restaurant, Provenance, as well as a retooled gift shop and monthly special displays from all over the world. It's amazing. Now, the special displays usually do cost (to pay for the collections being able to travel there from across the world,) but the rest of the museums collections are free.So, to enlighten the mind, pep up the soul, and learn about the wonders of art, please, check out the Cleveland Museum of Art, you'll be glad you did; it'll be HISTORIC!",1
"I love this place, and I go all the time! The staff is gorgeous, friendly, and attentive! The game selection is amazing, and the games are all in great condition. Anytime a game has broken down or malfunctioned, the management are quick to fix the machine and provide extra tokens to compensate. On the weekends, this is the place to be! Beautiful women, fantastic drinks, amazing music, and the best atmosphere around!",1
I love this store. I've been there 3 times and I have had the most pleasant and courteous experience. The people that work there are happy and are easy to talk to. They are so helpful and knowledgeable about all of their products. I have found my new favorite store.,1
"CN Tower is amazing way to see Toronto. It's a gimmicky type thing but I love it none the less. Every tourist and resident should go to the top to see the beauty of Toronto, water, city, land. It's a shame that I only got to go in the winter as I'm sure it's much more beautiful in the 3 other seasons! Go to the Aquarium too if you're here. Even though it's Ripley's attraction, it's truly beautiful, well thought out, and inspiring.",1
"Ras, tres bien, le restaurant authentique japonais, on est transporté !A real Japanese atmosphere, the decor is amazing; wooden combined with rock elements like the table, I love that ! The meal was good, enough warm, and the prices are fair, I don't hesitate for a good tip, it was a very good experience !!",1
"Several of our friends told us to go to the Canal Club.  We found this restaurant/bar to have great food and drinks and excellent service.  We went twice and Amy was our server both times and she went above and beyond to take care of us.  Thanks so much, Amy!!!",1
The flaming beef sandwich is AMAZING!!! I am attaching the menu because I couldn't find one online and my husband wanted something different.,1
Highly recommend the Loquito Sandwich.  Full of flavor bread soft and perfect.  Best sandwich I have had in years.,1
"I have ordered here plenty of times, and never have I been let down. In fact, when they were closed for filming I was not mad, I was hurt that I couldn't get my TGP fix. Lol. Their wings are always delicious and fresh, love their Thai peanut sauce and honey wasabi. But you really couldn't go wrong with any of the flavors they offer. So far I have tried a majority of their pies, all white sauces and WOW. Not to mention anything that comes out of their fryer is also always amazing.They truly outshine any other delivery services around here. They have kind people working there, delivery is always on time and food is always hot and fresh. I just ordered a BBQ chicken pie, fried mushrooms (YUM), and wings and am super excited!",1
"I don't review often, so I don't know if this will be recommended or not, but we just left BRGR after what could only be our 700th visit, and we were once again super satisfied. We are a fam of picky eaters, and this is the one place where everyone can find something!Thomas, our waiter tonight, was fantastic. He was so upbeat and nice, but not overbearing! Timed our to-go milkshakes perfectly so they weren't melted when we got home! He also managed to concoct an orange creamsicle milkshake, even though it wasn't on the menu, and honest to god knock me out, that thing was FIRE. I've never been so stoked for a milkshake in my entire dang life.We got wings n'at, which was perfect 420 food, and then 2 burgers, the shroom burger and the bison bbq burger. If you like mushrooms, get that shroom burger. So good.It was really a perfect night.",1
"Oregano's has huge salads, pasta and great pizzas.  They have amazing customer service on par with any high end restaurant.  I can recommend any of their salads, pasta or their Italian Gold wings are super moist and tasty. One of my favorite pizzas in the valley is their Clark Street meat pizza!  It is a little pricey but really good,",1
"It's a shame this place has terrible review because the service and food I have received from this Pizza Hut have always been to the highest of my expectations.I order on my iPhone for carrry-out and it is ready in 15 mins! Love that.Food is good too. Pizza Hut beats all chain pizza restaurants, in my opinion. And, this restaurant does a good job.",1
I have never been but my coworker was telling me about her great experience. Going to check them out.,1
Fresh sushi and sashimi. Delicious Korean dishes. Good customer service. Nice location with plenty of parking space available.,1
"Great Jamaican Food! Great Italian/Jamaican fusion. Jerk chicken meal, goat dinner and lasagna all bomb dinners!! I make sure i visit whenever I'm in Kensington Market.",1
"Bbq salmon bowl, gyoza, and shrimp tempura is worth every penny.  They also have Thai iced tea, Hawaiian and Chinese food items to choose from.  One of the best teriyaki bowls I've had in Vegas.",1
"I recently moved to the greater Phoenix area from the Chicago area, the Genoa Lakes staff has made my transition fantastic, There was a mixup with the apartment numbers , but it was resolved well before my arrival. The community is nice, the people in the complex have been very respectful and fairly quiet, great for a student like myself. The location is wonderful as well, the ability to do something or pick something up quickly is a rare find in most larger cities in America. Between the palm trees and the beautiful Arizonian sunsets, Genoa Lakes leaves little to be desired. I would genuinely like to thank the leasing, maintenance, and management, for a great experience thus far.",1
"Cordell consistently provides great service, he's incredibly knowledgeable, and VDN has amazing prices!!!! You could never have too much of a great thing. Congrats guys on the new location!!",1
"Just purchased our new Kia Optima on Tuesday.  We met Al Burke a few weeks ago on a Saturday evening when he should have been headed home for the night.  My husband and I had only stopped to walk around the lot, as we knew the dealership was closed.  But....much to our surprise, Al was on his way home, but he took the time to answer questions, and took us into the showroom and let us look at the inside of the car.  We went back to purchase our car from Al, received exemplary service and they worked with us to get the deal that we needed.  We would not hesitate to recommend that you purchase your next car from Horne and Al Burke.",1
Their Fish Tacos are F(AAA+)bulouso ! Amazing presentation that won't disappoint.  . . the flavors and textures of how they uniquely create these tacos will dance on your tongue.  Best Fish Tacos in Phoenix. Nice staff. Pleasant fun setting.,1
"This was a great place to dine. Very affordable, especially for the area. Family style servings are large with plenty of food. And the quality is exceptional.The menus are on the wall. So bring your camera. Take a picture. Then, go back to your table and make your selection. Easy.",1
"Recently had Johnny Delmonico's cater a business dinner. The service was fantastic, set-up smooth and the food was outrageously good. I took a risk and ordered salmon and it was the preferred choice over the steak. Everything was cooked perfectly, even after sitting for an hour prior to being eaten. I will recommend them to anyone needing an upscale dinner catered.",1
I love these donuts I've been coming here ever since I was a little boy the staff are excellent the people there are really nice I also love it because they give free coffee in general this place is the right to get your donuts !,1
"I was a regular patient of Dr Pappert's from 2004-2016 when I moved away. I've had a lot of dental issues all my life (40+ fillings, 2 crowns, braces, gum disease) and she's the best dentist I've ever had. Funny, kind, thoughtful, and so knowledgeable. Recently, I had a dental issue while on a business trip in Charlotte, and even though it had been 2.5 years since I left, they remembered me (the staff is so nice!), got me in right away, and her and Dr Kirk were so incredibly helpful. I came in in tears, but left on the mend. While I like my new dentist, I wish I could keep going to Dr a Pappert, as impractical as that would be.",1
Best bar in Charlotte. The staff is friendly and you can get quarters at the bar. Drinks are cheap and the atmosphear is very diverse and open.,1
"Well deserved 5 STAR rating ! I stopped by today, 10/12/18 to pick up few items for my family and as usually...I was ""in & out"", but have to say, it was a truly wonderful, shopping experience. Great, professional service from store Manager, Whitney...with Joy ( Sales Associate ) being friendly and very patient...who also offered a very beautiful gift wrap and what's even nicer...the price was right as well ! True value...I will definitely come back to this particular Bath & Body Works store ( 9827 S Eastern Ave, Las Vegas, NV  89183 ) and highly recommend it to everyone! Great job !",1
"dave - thanks for helping w/ my parent's fridge.  they are very appreciative of your help.  thanks for scheduling them right away and being prompt, professional and courtious.  i always appreciate talking with the owner who is the actual person who comes out and fixes the problem.  definitely highly recommended!  thank you again dave!",1
Being new to the area we gave this place a whril and fortunately we loved it. The sweet & sour chicken was tasty and the wong ton soup was delicious.  They didn't skimp on won tons - we got 10! We'll definitely be returning.,1
Friendly customer service and food is always amazing!!!  Love it here!!!  The muscle burger and swole man are go to all the time!!!,1
"Great place to start our Wing Crawl. The Angry Mustard wings were awesome. The staff was also very friendly. Great service. Our only complaint is that the size on the wings were a little small. They had great flavor, just wish there were more on the bone.",1
"We enjoyed wonderful service from Eric, especially considering our group of 15+ guests. The octopus was perfect and the zuppa fagiole was the perfect soul food. I will definitely be back!",1
Seriously love this place! Moved to North Scottsdale over a year ago and this was my 4th visit  though I had checked out a few other places in between trying to find a place similar in feel/price to where I've gone for years in the west valley. I wasn't happy at any of the other salons here in ScottsdaleBut I've been in love with every service at Plush! This is a perfect example of why...Nikki (I believe that's her name of who I see) remembers my autistic son likes to suggest colors for me before I go and is fond of lavender. This visit she wanted to add the chrome powder over the OPI gel. Loved it. The pic on the steering wheel was 3/17/18. I've had a crazy few months and didn't get to get in to get them redone again as quickly as I had planned but when I saw they were not chipping at the tips even I had to see if left alone how long it would last and it wasn't until my visit yesterday when the others were taken on 5/29/18!!! I did attempt to remove the polish from a few fingers at home on my right hand (why two fingers look worse than others) but got the steps backwards. Normally I would be horrified to have such overgrown color but I've NEVER had anything last over TWO MONTHS!!! I count myself lucky if I can get more than 2-3 weeks before the tips start chipping but honestly this has been my experience here since coming last 8/17.,1
Great food! Nice and clean. Friendly waiter. This is a fairly new restaurant  (3 months). I had the pan fried noodle combo and it was delicious. The crab puffs were great too. Price is moderate.,1
"Amazing food and cool vibe. I love coming here with my family both for the politics and the food. It is an oasis for us. A place to be visible, seen, and surrounded by love and acceptance. Plus, the food rocks!",1
"This review is for Bivian the lovely nail tech who I see religiously! She is fairly priced, very artistic and super sweet! I always get gel nail polish and am never disappointed. See Bivian for whatever your nail imagination desires. :)",1
"Honest and fast service.  My engine was suddenly making loud, unhappy noises when we had family visiting and needed both of our SUVs available.  Capitol was recommended by a few friends, though I had never heard of them.  They squeezed me in with no notice, even though they were booked, and then they drove me back to my house after I dropped off my car.  Called me back quickly and on time.  Turns out to have to been a minor, inexpensive repair.  I'm very pleased and glad to have found a trustworthy mechanic in Madison.  (Extra pluses: They have a very professional, large facility that is extremely clean and a friendly dog at the front desk.)",1
You won't be disappointed. Great food!! Great service. We found this place by accident. It's now our go to place. We bring All out of town family & friends. It's a great place!,1
"Delicious noodle soup.  Be aware that there is only a small eating area inside and a large patio for outside eating. The patio is nice, but some parts of the year it's just too hot to eat outside.   This is a great place for an inexpensive bowl of noodles for lunch, or a nice place for a drink and sushi on the patio at night.",1
Amazing!  She was so good at what she does and really took pride in making my wedding dress perfect!,1
Quick and easy with fees that were reasonable.  If you do not want to wait in the DMV line try this business.  Fees seem to average about $20.,1
Had the BBQ chicken bowl for dinner.. delish! Service was friendly and the price was fair.,1
"After meeting with Nathan and his wife we knew this was our DJ. Nathan is extremely talented and also offered to Emcee our wedding to ensure the flow of events never waivered. He brings plenty of extras to your event that include uplights, video, and stage lighting. Our guests didn't want the dance party to end! Nathan and his wife were a pleasure to work with and made themselves fully available to answer questions we had at anytime. They made our day perfect!",1
This place is the definition of what a street taco should be...they check all the boxes when it comes to a great taco. #tacofix,1
My garage door keep getting stuck every time we're closing.  Call this company today at 5:15pm.  He told me someone will be here between 7pm and 9pm.  I have 2 technician show up right on time.  They listen to what I have to said.  Then begin checking everything and explain the reasons and the solutions to fix the issues.  Works were done very efficiently and professionally.    Within 30min the work is complete and my garage door is now running smoothly.  They also help setup my garage door keypad that another garage door company told me was not functioning and have to be replace 3 years ago when I move in.  I'm so glad I do my research and yelped this time around.  Great company would recommend and call again.,1
- The restaurant is very authentic and beautifully decorated. - The okonomyaki is excellent and a big portion. Price is reasonable.- The other appetizer we had was very delicious (an egg dish).,1
Great cellar beers! We got a few bottles to go! Thanks for celebrating my mother in law's birthday!,1
"One of the best doctors I've been to, it is so hard to fine a good doctor that knows what they are doing. He has always been timely in getting me referrals and has always been thorough when I've had medical problems arise instead of brushing me off like doctors often can do. The rare times where he isn't sure what else to do or if something needs specialized attention he will refer me to a specialist. I'm not sure what all happened when he previously worked at Fit, and really I don't care, he has been a great doctor for me and knows his stuff. I trust him and he has never broken that trust with me, he cares and that is what matters most in a doctor. When we move up north to Washington State I will definitely miss him and his staff. I hope I am able to find someone half as good!",1
Fairfax with avocado and bacon and fresh squeezed oj. 20 bucks but well worth the price and the 45 minute wait. This place is a must....,1
"I am a Lyft driver, at 6:53pm this lady vomited in the back of my van. I had to drive 20 minutes to get to him, but he was done by 8:20pm maybe sooner. If I could give him more stars I would.",1
"Really tasty and cheap Venezuelan arepas. I had #8, with chorizo and onions for $7. Comes with refreshing salsa on the side. Very friendly staff.",1
"Wife and I stopped by after car shopping tonight. We tried some amazing dishes tonight. If you get a chance order this. It's not on the menu but it soooo yummy. Aki the Sushi Chef calls it ""The Flying Nun"" It's Bacon wrapped around a nugget size of chicken breast with cream cheese and get this Mash Potatoes and deep fried and rested on a bed of greens in Mustard sauce. I usually don't like cream cheese only on my bagel or cheese cake bu when its combined with mash potatoes it's a perfect combination with the bacon and chicken. Ok here's the other one that was a highlight of the meal ""Baked Mussels"" you get 4 on a plate. It's baked with a dynamite sauce (I think the ingredients are spicy hot sauce, mayo, and ketchup). When talking to the waitress Chieko, she told me one of the most popular appetizers was ""Creamy Mermaid"" - it is shrimp w/cream cheese stuffed in wonton skin and fried. My kids like Combo 1 which is chicken teriyaki, Tempura, Kara age. It's really good. Toshi is the kitchen chef and makes the best chicken. He does not over cook the chicken and he does not under cook it. It's perfect. Tender, not tough it is soft and juicy still. This is very hard to do if you ever tried to cook chicken with different thickness. The Tigers Eye sushi is really cool. It's not on the menu just ask for it. If your feeling really adventurous behind Aki is this small white board with some specials of the day. If you ever want to check out skill of a sushi chef order the Tamago. It's basically egg but the thing is it requires great skill to make it. Also the taste sweet but not too sweet. order it try it. Thats a pretty good thing to order and check out the skills of the chef. Ask Aki how he makes the egg.",1
I love staying at GVR. The hotel is absolutely stunning. It is clear that the designers really put the time in to make this place feel like a top notch resort. Every time I stay here I make sure to request a room with a pool view because it makes the experience so much more wonderful.,1
"Compelled to share a brief review after two visits - very accommodating to our family and in particular to children (which prompted our second visit, and surely future ones). Staff had a great attitude! Good food and fun atmosphere!",1
Love this place! Best rice plates ever- teriyaki beef or chicken! Service is always wonderful & fast. Highly recommend this sushi place to all sushi lovers!!,1
Still remains as one of the valley's most creative and high production value escape rooms. Maybe only a handful meet their level in AZ!,1
"Great cigar bar! Exclusively Fuente brands with several select cigars that are exclusively available only at Casa Fuente (i.e. Opus Angel Share, Casa Fuente brand, certain God of Fire cigars). Nice selection of cocktails. They are known for their Mojitos (Classic and Tangerine) and Sangria's (red and white). They also have a nice selection of malts, cognacs, whiskey and bourbon that pairs well with cigars.",1
"Rich is a class act, and his classy shop has every kind of hat you could possibly hope for, from casual knockabouts to museum-quality Stetsons. Rich will carefully listen to your needs, then steer you gently in the right direction without hovering or badgering. If you can't find it here, it doesn't belong on your head.",1
"Always a classic, you can not go wrong here if poutine is your goals. This is not  a fancy shmancy she trip. Service was actually really good.",1
"It may just look like an ordinary restaurant in Casino Center but Brasa Roja LV is the best and most affordable Columbian cuisine in Las Vegas. When you wander in you'll be immediately greeted by the friendly staff and incredible aroma of their chicken.I've ordered numerous dishes and everything down to the crazy priced $4.95 specials are nothing short or well thought out delicious masterpieces. The chicken is like little bombs of goodness, and the beef is robust but not overpowering. Whenever my order has arrived my expectations have continued to be exceeded.Don't let appearances fool you--the decor may be casual , but the food coupled with truly delightful service is fantastic. The entire staff and manager really seem to care and make you feel like family. This place is perfect for groups or a casual date night.",1
Surprisingly a good selection of products and clothes. Everyone was friendly and I will definitely be back!,1
"Although the wait can be a little long, it's definitely worth it. The staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. The portions are large. You won't be disappointed.",1
"My absolute favorite restaurant!! My husband and I come here a few times a month for date night. We always get the Arizona Roll and Gila Monster Nachos, but this past time we also split the Baja Burger... so delicious. The whole meal was simply amazing! Thank you Pomegranate Cafe!!",1
Amazing dog! Had to go with the elote dog and elote fries and skip the dirty chili dog which sounded delicious as well. .....the elote dog and fries did not disappoint! Great vibe inside with walls painted and 2 Pac on the speakers. Cant wait to come back and try the dirty chili!!,1
Totally awesome! Got the Banh Mi Dipped and ribeye pho to go. Heated it up when I got home and yumma dum dum.  Hostess was nice and the packaging for ToGo food was excellent. Coming back for sure.,1
"Jim did a tremendous job guiding me through the diminished value claim process. I dealt with an insurance company who was unwilling to even speak to me about a diminished claim.  I simply followed all the steps he provided, submitted the appropriate documentation, followed up as necessary and received a great settlement. It was worth every penny to have Jim on my team.",1
"I thought this might just be a novelty, but it is delicious! I had vanilla with fresh bananas and Carmel. It was great and so smooth. I think the liquid nitrogen makes it so there is no ice crystals. Very enjoyable.",1
Very favorite place for breakfast. I love the Parisian atmosphere. My only wish is that they would put those beautiful old French books in a safe location instead of using them as holders for tickets.,1
I've lived literally within walking distance of this restaurant and for some reason never visited.  HUGE MISTAKE- all that wasted time!  My husband treated me to dinner for my birthday and I chose the go to White Oaks.  Honestly I initially wanted to go to Ruth's Chris but after a disastrous lunch and really bad service I changed my mind.  So glad I did.  The service was excellent from the valet to the cost check and all the way to the very attentive busser.  I have a pretty specific way I like my steak cooked - between rare and medium rare and normally most restaurants just never get it quite right.  I generally get it almost medium.  My steak was PERFECT!  I made sure to pass it on to the chef.  The whole experience was wonderful!  No more high priced chain nonsense for us!  The rustic atmosphere was cozy and beautiful!  We will definitely be going back!  Thank you for the lovely birthday!,1
Probably the best class I have taken so far I have been a provider for 12 years. The facility was very clean and organized equipment in perfect condition. The instructor Brandon was entertaining and knowledgeable. He also managed the the class well and with respect although some people seemed to do whatever they want and not return that same courtesy. One suggestion would be is maybe have some of the SIMS on tables or maybe all of the. As adults it's tough for us to sit in the floor for long periods of time. (He did offer tables). I would highly recommend this place!,1
"Came with with a friend for girls dinner. We were seated promptly and told how the conveyor and hot pot works from the most helpful waiter. I even dropped my chopstick at one point and he saw it and promptly swooped in with a fresh set before I could pick mine up! Food was fresh and delicious and the sauce bar is fully equipped with many tasty sauces and condiments. They even gave us Java ice cream at the end which was a perfect sweet ending. Exceptional customer service and overall experience, start to finish. I will absolutely be returning.",1
I love this place! And I just found out that they deliver! Oooh yeeeaaahhh buddy! Lol I love the corn egg flower soup. :),1
Absolutely amazing I love this community already. My Fiancé and I had to find a place to live for a year and I'm glad we ran into Danial! He showed us various different floor plans and he was very patient with our decision. Once we did decide he still had great communication on our move in date and what was going on with the floor plan that we wanted. All in all we love it here and we loved our experience.,1
"I love Camelback Mazda! Bought our first new car there six years ago - a 2008 CX-9, then traded it in yesterday for a 2014 CX-9. Nice, friendly people - easy to work with sales department - and a great service department! Thanks to manager Richard Lucciano, sales consultant Charles Nunez, sales professional Lenny Di Russo, sales consultant Don L, and service manager Iain Woolley. :)",1
"Dr Harlan Sparer is the best chiropractor I've ever had. His practice is unique by utilizing Directional Non-Force Technique. This means he is working with your spine in all directions to align you. There is no pain involved, no cracking, no rolling pins, etc. Only relief after he's found the problem. I honestly think he can fix anything related to or connected to the spine.Dr Sparer's goal is to heal you, not to bleed your wallet. Once you're feeling better (3 - 6 visits typically) he doesn't need to see you again until you do something to hurt yourself. No other chiropractor in the business will encourage you to stop returning for more treatments. That's the beauty of what Dr Sparer does. It may be his business, but it's also his passion. Every year he continues his education, learning from his colleagues the current best practices in his profession. This means you're always in good hands with current knowledge.When I was first treated by Dr Sparer, I had come to terms with lifelong back pain. But three visits later I was pain free for the first time ever as an adult. It felt like a miracle, but it was just proven science. In the three years since of being a patient, I've had numerous surgeries which are tough on the body. Yet I've only needed 3 total adjustments meaning the results last... Long term relief is possible and Dr Sparer has the ability to give you the pain relief you deserve.",1
"We can't speak for the negative reviews because I find them very hard to believe. We interviewed and received quotes from 4 different pool contractors in Phoenix and by far this company was the easiest to work with, with the least amount of ""car salesmanship"", the best price and the most open communication. Our pool was completed at the beginning of July and we've enjoyed it ever since. The temperature now is a bit cool but the kids still love it. I'm sure there are multiple salesman at the company and money does play an important part of completing a project of this size. Our salesman was truly professional and we knew the price and the timelines going into the project. I suggest if you plan on completing a project like this in your house - do your homework and don't fall for the salesman tactics and be wise to what you will actually utilize when swimming 3-4 mos of the year in AZ.  We highly recommend Dolphin Pools.",1
"The best customer service I've experienced so far in the US! Becky, our waitress, was so amazing. She was so friendly, bubbly, welcoming, smooth, and awesome. She gave out great vibes at every table. She gave me a soju on her because it was my 21st birthday. The food was great, especially for only $17 and the quantity and quality. Thanks Becky for making our day! Definitely will be back (with more people haha).",1
The food here is amazing! I've been three times and I'm also recommending it to my friends! The sandwiches are filling and delicious and the fries and so light and tasty. The atmosphere is quaint and relaxing ....I was lucky to meet the owners and they are very friendly and passionate about their cuisine.,1
"Lotus is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas. The food here is reasonably priced and never disappoints!  I highly recommend the garlic prawn if you want to win people over. Lotus is also famous for their curries which I can't get enough of! I love that they'll do special orders- I take that to mean all the food is cooked fresh in their kitchen. For dessert, I love their coconut ice cream with sticky rice.The service is good despite being overwhelmed with customers on most evenings. Make a reservation for weekend nights (which you have to do 24 hours in advance).Meeting some panhandlers during the walk in is just a part of the Lotus experience now. So is the cafeteria-style seating and the slighlty strange decor.That being said, the awards that this restaurant has gotten are well deserved. For my friends who visit town, I always consider Lotus a must-do stop. The only thing I could ask for is that this place would open for lunch on the weekends!",1
"This place is fantastic. I was afraid that the taste might be off or have a bit of freezer burn considering how thin it's spread out and rolled but nope - completely delicious.The staff if very friendly and kind - they're excited to explain the process to you and let you know which flavors they recommend if you're like me and wanted everything off of the menu. The basics are you pick an ice cream (some of which comes with things added in like strawberries or just by itself) and then you have a choice of 3 toppings - all in a regular cup or a waffle bowl. I opted for a normal cup. The price is $5.50 or $6.50 depending on the size plus another $1 if you get the waffle bowl. Considering how unique this place is and the choice of flavors and toppings, not a bad price. I got the smaller size and I thought the portion size was perfect.In the end I got the Matcha ice cream with strawberries and condensed milk mixed inside topped with a strawberry and red beans. A friend got the Thai Tea ice cream with whip cream, chocolate chips and coconut. The atmosphere is lively and boisterous. There's a few places you can sit but the place looks rather popular so depending on when you come in, there may not be seating inside. Not to worry though, wondering Coventry as you eat is always an option!I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area!",1
"I did my homework and searched relentlessly for the most affordable quote for top and bottom braces for my 12 year old son. Finally, I found a winner with Affordable Braces. After 4 quotes Dr. Heinrich not only was $2,000 cheaper, but the staff all around was more authentic, caring, & accommodating. The receptionist, Pricilla has superior customer service. I could defiantly tell a difference between Orthodontists because Dr. Heinrich takes great pride in his work and really takes the time to listen, answer questions, and/or any concerns. I would definitely recommend Affordable braces to anyone. My son left with a huge smile & it's all thanks to Dr. Heinrich & his amazing staff!!!!! JAM",1
"Probablement un des meilleurs cafés en ville. Simple, agréable, heures d'ouverture intéressantes pour Villeray.",1
"The crepes are delicious! We come here for breakfast or for lunch. For lunch, we always order a salad in addition to the crepes. We enjoy both the sweet and the savory crepes. This is also a good place to meet friends for coffee. They have a good selection of coffees and teas. The service is great. I'm happy to have this restaurant here in Ahwatukee.",1
"Burgushi ! What a concept !!! But this place is always crazy busy :( hated the long wait out in the cold. Next time I'm getting a reservation. Wednesday's they also have 1/2 off bottles, so make it date night you won't regret it :)",1
"The club at night was so fun! They had the best band playing old Rock en Español music. The bartender & wait staff were so friendly. It was pretty dead earlier for dinner. But, when we went back to dance around 10 p.m., it was packed and a perfect little dance club scene.",1
"Excellent pizza and pasta! The Barbarino pizza is awesome! Love bands on Friday, nice cozy casual Italian atmosphere. Great staff! I have been 3x since I moved to the area last month and plan to continue to come back.",1
"Went back today for a 3 week refill..Shen is oficially my lash fairy  I was running late because of the snow so I texted her ahead of time and she accommodated me and even fed me some granola bars when I arrived because I skipped lunch haha then I just fell asleep while she worked her magic..woke up to beautiful lush lashes. Her lash isolation is on point and she is so gentle, lash retention is also good.At the end she recommended I wait a bit and give my lashes a break to grow out as its the start of my lash cycle again and advised me to book for 4 weeks after next time. I appreciate that she actually cares about my lashes rather then tell me to book ASAP after 2 weeks like many other lash techs. Thank you again Shen!PS she is doing a prize draw for all December bookings. I was lucky and won a lash serum!",1
"Undeniably the best Pho I've had in Phoenix since moving 5 years ago from Seattle.  The broth is outstanding,  an explosion of flavor and tender perfectly cooked shrimp and veggies, can't wait 2 to try the beef too. The other dish we tried was grilled chicken  with rice and just as delicious. The chef cooked for another restaurant for 20 years and finally opened this place 3 years ago. We'll be back soon. Every other Pho restaurant in the area cannot compare,  other broths taste like water.Great food Pho VN. Thanks",1
"I love everything about South Hills Vet! This location is extremely close to my house so it only made sense to bring my new puppy here when I got him. I have been back several times for the rest of his shots and his neuter. The staff is always amazing, caring, and super helpful. Being a new dog mom, I did have a lot of questions and I have called in a few times with some worries. Each time the staff has answered my questions and reassured me everything was okay! Dr.Mullings is so great at what she does and I'm happy my Rex has her as his vet!",1
Late last night with the munchies and the wife and i settled for the carne asada fries ... Wow Amazing .... Then our drive thru guy Kenny was just an absolute pleasure to deal with . Thank you Fili B's and Kenny for a great late meal,1
Omg is all I can say! Ate here yesterday and it was AMAZING!!!! The baked beans are so good as well as the mac and cheese! All the meat is seasoned so good I didn't even need bbq sauce! I will definitely be coming back here again when I'm out this way!,1
"I have been looking for a good nail place ever since I moved here 6 months ago, and I finally found it!!! Nick took great care of me.  My nails and toes look fantastic!!!  Definitely going to continue coming here!!",1
"Food was delicious. Vincent, our server, treated us so well and accommodated our requests for veggie options. Service was great. Will definitely be back!",1
"This is the best place to get tacos in Vegas!I've tried lengua, tripa, adobada, asada, and suadero. Never disappointed.However, the star of the menu is the Campechana fries. For less than $5 you can get an order of fries topped with both asada and adobada and all the fixings!Yummmmmm",1
"Stayed here for a quick trip to Cleveland and I'd definitely stay here again (if I were again able to use the Marriott Friends/Family discount). The hotel IS pretty pricey but it's very nice. THE GOOD: The glass of champagne upon check is a nice touch. My King room was clean and comfortable. Electrical plugs and dimming light switches are well placed, the Samsung SmartTV is amazing, lighted magnifying mirror in bathroom is great. The bed was good, firm if that's what you're into. The in-room wifi signal is super strong. Never had an issue connecting or staying connected. I love the shower in the room...though it did take a minute for the water to get hot and the pressure leaves something to be desired...it's super spacious and very sexy. (Speaking of sexy, this isn't a room that you'd share with someone you're uncomfortable with. The bathroom as a whole is NOT a separate entity and though the shower has wavy glass, you can still totally see silhouettes through it.)I don't believe there's a way that anyone who is not staying at the hotel is able to get onto any floor outside of the lobby and basement. You need a room key to operate the elevators. I think this is great for security reasons. There's a Heinen's grocery store attached and although you have to walk outside to get to its entrance, it's well-stocked and the employees were very helpful. The hotel is very close to major downtown attractions. Location is perfect. THE MEH: I tried to use the extra blanket they have stocked in the cabinet one night. It smelled clean but it left fuzzies all over the bed. Took it off and turned the heat up instead. There are very nice quality drinking glasses in the room but nobody should ever drink out of those. Germ city!  I get wanting to keep things fancy but the hotel should seriously consider providing wrapped plastic cups. Maybe put them in the very fancy ice bucket so they're not in plain view?  There is no desk in the room. This was a bit surprising. This could be sucky for business travelers or people who want to eat their room service on something other than their laps. I was awakened early (like 2am) this morning by housekeeping knocking on my door. When I didn't answer they called my room. They thought I had requested a dental kit. Wrong room. Grrrrrrr. Then I was awakened again at about 4am but someone pounding on the walls in the hallway. I know that every guest isn't a good guest but it was super annoying. Not the hotel's fault and I know you risk things like this when there is a bar and nightclub on site. I stayed in room 1116. The view was abysmal. I just kept the curtains closed. Valet parking is expensive as hell. If you drive around a bit, you are sometimes able to find street parking within walking distance. Good luck!Did not experience so cannot comment on: Adega, room service, bar, nightclub, rooftop, dog park, gym.",1
"Overdue review had breakfast with family. Excellent food and service came back for more the next two days. Menu continues to change with seasons, gives the chef the opportunity to allows keep ingredients fresh. The ladies in our group liked the small stands for their hand bags.",1
"Really fresh and delicious. This was my first time here and it lives up to it's reputation of quality. All the workers were very happy, the food took a little longer than McDonald's, and the restaurant was very clean. A well run fast food joint.",1
"Delicious, good service and great presentation. We were shocked and didn't expect that. Fresh sashimi and oysters!",1
"wow! i meant to say wow. best noodles and soup i've ever had. can't say enough if i could give them 6 stars i would. so with that said ""wow""",1
"If you are looking for a great restaurant in Charlotte, do be sure to visit Dressler's for dinner....and if you're lucky enough to have Clark K. as your waiter, then you'll dub him Superman as we did!  My hubby and I (from NYC) were visiting my best friend and her hubby and celebrating her birthday...so expectations were high.  We dine out in NY almost 3x/week and have had varied experiences, some frustrating and some amazing,  and we wrongly thought that Dressler's could even compete.  We willingly gave it a try on Saturday night and were thoroughly impressed.  I will state without reservation that the food was wonderfully presented and quite delicious; but for me, the make or break for any restaurant is its front-line staff ,which is equally as important as the chef's skill.  I tend to regard the waitperson's role as ambassador for the restaurant.Clark is the consummate professional -- he was friendly, showed great attention to the details, big and small, and offered us superior service.  One key thing was that he didn't badger us with information the moment we sat down, he allowed us the time to enjoy our cocktails and our friends.  He read our table perfectly and approached at the right time throughout the entire evening.  How many times have waiters/waitresses rudely interrupted your conversation with specials or to ask if you're enjoying your meal, while you are trying to chew or rushing you out because they are at the end of their shift?  Clark, not only did not employ any of the above but he shared his wonderful personality with each of us individually and as a group.  I've never felt better attended to or respected as a diner as I did with him.Our simple Wedgie Salads were fresh, nicely presented and tasty.  The Thai calamari was a great twist on an old favorite.  Our entrees which included flounder, seared tuna and two types of steak were enjoyed and consumed happily.We will definitely return to Dressler's when we visit again and will keep our fingers crossed for another wonderful experience with our Superman!",1
"The restaurant is small and crowd sometimes, but the food is great. Sashimi is refreshing, heard that all food ingredients aired straight from tokyo, and it offers THE best toro I ever had. The grilled eel took long time to be served but it was incredible tender, worth the wait!!!",1
"Love this place! Further north than the congestion of Korea Restaurants at Yonge and Finch, Song Cook's can be found tucked away behind the Galleria Supermarket at Yonge and Steeles. Don't be deceived by it's hidden view - this place is huge inside! But don't take that for granted - it can get quite busy on weekends so best to make a reservation if you can. They have regular seating and traditional floor seating which is great, but can be hard for people with knee or back problems.Food to get: Their Jajangmyeon is probably the best in the area, their sweet and spicy fried chicken is amazing (may seem pricey but HUGE portion), their Dukboki is spicy and saucy, and their kamjatang and soon tofu can stand up to the competition. I have yet to have a dish I don't like there :)Marginally more expensive than some korean joints, but worth it as the food quality is much much better (less fast-food like).Would I return? - AbsolutelyParking? - Yes, a lotValue for $? - GoodSpace? - Large inside/good sized waiting areaVentilation? - GoodService? - Great",1
"love coming here! i've been coming here for around 3-4 years now. every time is super great! tonight we ate with MICHELLE as our server. she was very timely and upbeat. very knowledgeable in giving us really good suggestions and giving us some rest time in between meals so we don't get too stuffed. definitely ask for her if she's available however, all the servers i've had have been just as good as well.",1
"Visit Shortbread By Gryphon for the best shortbread. Period.  Double Period..Peggy has been baking shortbread and crafting a multitude of other delicacies in her Monkland storefront since the early 2000's.  Pass by and she'll always greet you with a smile (and usually a sample of her latest confectionery creation!).Let me give you a rundown of some of my favourite options from Gryphon:Shortbread - this one's in the title, delicious, crumbly, with just the right balance of sweet and salty/buttery flavour.Scones - available as fresh individual scones, or in a traditional farl of 8 wedges, frozen so you can bake them at home.Irish flapjacks - imagine a granola bar held together by butter and brown sugar, OK go to Gryphon and you won't have to imagine.Millionaire bars - small shortbread rectangles with a layer of English Toffee on top, covered in Belgian Chocolate sprinkled with edible gold dust.Millionaire sandwiches - small shortbread cookies (my favourites are the smaller ones :D ) with a layer of English Toffee sandwiched between them, and the whole thing covered in Belgian Chocolate sprinkled with edible gold dust!If you appreciate the true Irish and Scottish heritage of shortbread and scones, this is the place to go.I dare you to stop at just one!",1
"I really can not say enough about Mesa Grill.  I wish I could eat here all the time.  I am so glad that I don't live in Vegas because I would go broke.  Not from gambling but from going to the Mesa Grill and eating everything on the menu multiple times.  We have heard good things about the restaurant so I took my husband here for his birthday.  The staff was amazing!  Our waiter was the best ever, he was nice and helpful and knowledgeable.  My husband had the Lamb Chops, they were very good.  I however ordered the most fabulous thing on the menu, the Pork Tenderloin.  It was spicy and the sauces were perfect, the meat juicy and cooked just right.  The tamale that came with my dish was a sweet potato.  I don't like sweet potato so they gave me a jalapeno one instead, and this was also great.  For dessert we shared a banana cream pie.  It was delicious as well, sweet but not too sweet.  The restaurant itself is large and you can somewhat watch the kitchen.  The grilling area is right out front for people to watch and as we left we heard the cooks asking someone watching them if they had any questions.  I thought that was great that they encouraged people to ask about what they were doing.  This entire experience was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  The pork tenderloin was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Not kidding.",1
"I've been ordering take-out from this place for a few years. I remember the first time I ordered the alfredo and had shrimp and mushrooms added to it. I was very surprised to see 6 JUMBO shrimp in the alfredo and they didn't even charge me for the mushrooms. The sauce is thick and creamy and the noodles are always al dente. You get a free side of garlic bread and it's my favorite kind, which is a small loaf of bread. I continue to order this same shrimp alfredo and it's always been delicious and they have never charged me for the mushrooms. The delivery staff is always very friendly. Love this place!",1
It is my favorite place to be. I love it. The interior design is magnificent. I love the indoor boat ride!. love everything about it. im in love with venetian.,1
love love love caras - a great neighborhood gem.  the staff was so helpful and i was able to find great holiday gifts and something for myself too! the selection of alex and ani is amazing and liz knew what i wanted before i did!  i always find different and fun items at caras - thanks for being there!,1
"I love attempting to convince myself of living a healthier lifestyle! I came here & spent nearly $60 for juice! I then went to Yoshinoya & Krispy Kreme. Who am I fooling!?!? Ok let's move on because there's no helping me. This place really has it going on. It's very clean, very cute & the juice presentations are awesome. It definitely inspires one to get healthy even if that lasts for only an hour. I walked in & was immediately greeted by the nicest kid who is eager to sample me up & we had a lot of fun trying nearly everything. Sampling is the smartest thing ever because it really gets us in the mood to spend more money & I instantly knew what I could attempt to drink and what I absolutely couldn't. I love that he tried getting me in on the healthiest ones which I had a hard time swallowing. Grass isn't my favorite flavor. Some of these juices were way too hard core for me however I was pleasantly surprised that some of them tasted really good! So I went for it & splurged! They have so many great fresh ingredients such as apples, cucumbers, celery, lemons, kale, beets, Brazilian nuts, vanilla & so much more! My plan is to skip lunch & juice it up at work. We shall see how long I last before someone forces me to eat something because I'm extra mean when hangry. This stuff is all natural & organic & I'm excited! Hopefully I have some will power before my mom gets back in town & I find myself dying in Zion again :)Hi mom :) Love you! (My mom loves reading my reviews) lol",1
"I had stayed here for my 21st birthday a few years back. My friend gave me a trip to vegas for my birthday. My dear friend got us a suite in the north tower. I didnt have a view..but I didnt care. I loved my room. It had a huge tub in the middle of the room. and his and hers closets and vanity area. Also had a mini living room area. I loved my room, the hubby and I enjoyed it to the max. if you know what I mean. haha..Im not sure about the price since I didnt pay for the room. The location is awesome since its in the middle of the strip. Its connected with Paris hotel and right in front of the Bellagio and ceasars palace...LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION....THIS IS THE BEST!",1
"Simply the best.  My wife needed some cosmetic removal of some blemishes and sun spots.  Thoughtful and caring, Dr. Garcia and his staff were incredible, exceeding our expectations.  We have referred others to Dr. Garcia for regenerative medicine related to anti-aging and joint repair and all have echoed the same sentiments.",1
This S&F has the best staff. Everyone is very courteous. The exterior/interior is clean. Their products are fairly priced as well.,1
"Oh yum. Had the best dinner at Rehab! We had the Beijing Beefstro salad to start. Firstly, it is GIGANTIC. And it is so delicious. It has an awesome Serrano dressing that has quite a lot of kick. It also has sliced fresh jalapeños, but i took those off. The beef on top is sliced thin and kind of what you would expect to see on a cheesesteak sandwich. It's warm on top of the salad too which is nice. It also comes with crispy onions and wonton strips. It was so good. Then we split a spicy Mac and cheese burger with sweet potato tots. The burger is definitely a knife and fork kind of burger. The Mac and cheese was pretty good. Had a pretty good flavor. As you can tell from my description the salad was my clear favorite, but the burger was still really great too. We would go back!",1
"After the Wynn, this is the next best buffet in Vegas. A variety of unique dishes. A dessert bar that has something for everyone. Especially loved the chocolate covered strawberry station. Crab legs and lobster tail to your hearts content. A little pricey but I'd prefer spending that $20 or $30 more to eat here rather than the buffets at the other casinos.",1
"Was desperately seeking a new dentist after my tooth suddenly broke in my mouth. Yikes! What is a bloke to do? Yelp, of course. Precision Dental was closest to my digs, looked respectable, and had good reviews. No brainer. Since my situation was somewhat dire, reception staff (thanks Jackie, Beth, Elaine) got me in right away to check out my chops. They scheduled me to see Dr. Marquez, who was personable and professional, thus I knew I was in good hands from the get-go. I was afraid I might lose the tooth entirely, but Dr. Marquez saved it by building a magnificent crown in its place. I also had a few old silver filings that had decay, thus Dr. Marquez swapped 'em out for white-ceramic fillings. Now, the inside of my mouth doesn't look like a rust bucket anymore. Ha! I initially came to have dental work done, and left with not only a new dentist but a new family!",1
Everything is great about this place.  The art work is worth the stop alone.  My weakness is a fruity pepple shake.,1
So happy that we hired Scott and his team to help us move! We had several delays caused by our buyers timeline and they worked with us to find a solution that worked with us both. I was amazed by how polite and thoughtful every employee was during the process. This was by far the best spend of money during this move process. I highly recommend Scott Halvin's team from Avondale. His email is Scott.Harvin@chhj.com.,1
"Now this is what a downtown LV bar should be. Nothing pretentious. Nothing spectacular. Just comfortable seating. Friendly and knowledgable bar staff. Excellent craft beer selection on draft.Granted, our visit on a Sunday night during Memorial Day weekend may have been unusual. We were previously down on Fremont East and the area wasn't busy at all. But I enjoyed having an available parking space seconds away from the entrance. I liked not having to show ID to a door person. I even appreciated the fact that they have no servers roaming the seating areas. To order a drink, you go to the bar and they bring it out to you.The only thing that disappointed me is that (I think) there used to be some awesome street art on the side wall of the building. I can understand the removal, but it's still a shame. You can see what I mean here:http://paolodlr.com/2011/05/may-10-prephotowalk-photowalk.htmlI could be wrong. Perhaps the street art is on another similarly looking building and is alive and well.",1
"Great new cafe! Great dessert!Amazing shaved ice with delicious toppings.And the also have awesome Gelatos!Love the new decor & cozy environment.The staff was great & very nice.Whether it's a first date or a hang out spot, this is the perfect place to go for dessert!",1
"Dinner last night was incredible! And so reasonably priced.We started off with a small piece of filet and artichoke, compliments of the chef. There was a white sauce with a hint of horseradish on top and the meat was delicious. Then the bread was brought out. It came with whipped butter and a pesto dip which was so yummy. There was several different breads: a pepperoni roll, a wheat, and a slice with what I think were sundried tomatoes. The pepperoni roll was incredible and I am not normally a fan of pepperoni...For appetizers we ordered the bacon-wrapped dates ($8) and the calamari ($7). The calamari was nice and crispy and the lemon pepper tartar sauce had a little kick to it. However, the clear winner of this round was the dates. They are stuffed with chorizo and a water chestnut, then wrapped in bacon and served with an amazing hoisin dipping sauce. The water chestnut added just the right amount of crunch and the dipping sauce was fantastic. These are a must-order!Next, the bowl of seafood bisque ($7) I ordered came out. The manager warned me that it was a big bowl of soup but the size still surprised me! It was probably the best seafood bisque I have ever tasted, loaded with chunks of shrimp, scallop and crab that I could actually identify, unlike some that I have ordered in the past. At only $7 it's a steal! I had to box at least half of it up t leave room for my entree.Next came a mini martini glass with a small scoop of orange sherbet to cleanse our palettes. I am normally more of an ice cream fan, but this was some of the best sherbet ever! I found myself wishing the scoop was just a little big bigger :)The entrees were brought next. I ordered the filet with prawns ($26) and my friend got the lamb ($22). My filet was cooked perfectly rare and the bearnaise on top was to die for. The prawns sat on some tomato lime coulis which was great. My friend let  me try a piece of lamb and it too was cooked perfectly to medium rare. It had just the right amount of fat in the cut of meat. Our sides included broccolini (also cooked perfectly), au gratin potatoes (yummy), creamed spinach (not as creamy as I am used to but the crunchy topping really elevated it), and lobster mashed potatoes (with chunks of delicious lobster in nearly every bite, $7 upcharge). At this point I was too stuffed to eat anymore, but my friend ordered the dessert special, a baklava cheesecake ($7). The round cheesecake had the sweet honey glaze on it and crunchy filo and nuts piled on top. I only managed one bite but the contrast of the cheesecake with the crunchy filo was amazing!Finally, we were brought two small chocolate espresso cubes to finish up. I ate a bit of one and it was creamy and delicious. All the food we were served was soo delicious and the best part was the price: Just over $100 WITH TIP.  I mean, we basically had an eight course meal for two people, so that is an incredible deal. Plus I was so impressed with the quality of the food. The filet was one of the best I have ever had, the seafood bisque was absolutely loaded with seafood, and I will dream about those dates until I can go back. This is a great gem of a restaurant.",1
Such great guys they have saved myself more times than I can count :) yes I'm a mess lol,1
I try never to miss at least going once a weekend.  Best breakfast in the 'Burgh.,1
"I was out yesterday to buy new filters and aquatic plants and headed to the local PetSmart to see what I could find; their entire fish section looked dilapidated and no employee was there to help me; I decided to head over to Petco and check out their fish; by contrast, Petco's selection of fish and all of their displays looked well maintained and vibrant; Robert is the guy to ask for for all things fish; he was very attentive to all of my needs and questions and has extensive knowledge about fish, -he helped me diagnose a fin rot problem, pick affordable aquatic plants, and helped educate me on which fish I could put together and so on; Petco for fish: highly recommended!",1
"I came to low book sales after doing some research online. The employees at this location surpassed all of my expectations. Not only were they knowlegable and had great customer service, but they went out the of their way to find me a car. They even welcomed my 2 crazy young kids. I was originally denied the car I had my eyes on. They then came back to me and pulled up this beautiful car I never thought I would get approved  for, EVER! my heart sank when I saw it and after I got to test drive it I got my hopes up. Next thing i know im signing papers! I recommend this dealership to anybody and everybody! They have the skills that ever car dealership should model after!",1
"IF YOU ARE TIRED OF STARBUCKS bitter taste, and overpriced limited selection of possibilities AND BEING RIPPED OFF...this is the place for you! It doesn't get better than this. Top notch customer service, cozy little place to hide, phenomenal quality of coffee and tea. This little place makes Starbucks look and taste so ghetto! I absolutely love their selection of milk teas, coffee, espresso, smoothies and hand crafted blends. Not to mention the desserts! Everyone I take there with me, ends up going back! Such a wonderful place...",1
I love this place! This place takes me back to the east coast by far the best thin NY style pizza I've had in Surprise. The owners are great people and always welcoming.,1
The best kept secret in Pittsburgh!   Don't tell anybody.......but the food here is fantastic!!!  No charge for opening bottle!,1
"Forgot the name of the spot i got this at. Not sure if this is the name or location.Can't believe I didn't get the name down.But if this is the spot, this was the best meal of my life!",1
"Very relaxing salon. Everyone that works there is extremely nice. Their selection for pedicures is amazing! They use a paraffin wax that makes your feet feel soft for weeks! I always go to Jenny for my nails, and she always does an excellent job. Definitely would recommend this shop to everyone!!",1
as good as it gets!  the best ice cream in town.  affordable too with lunch options,1
"Singh farms is just a fun place to enjoy nature and soak in the the beautiful air around. Everyone you meet is very friendly, even the owner comes around to chat with the guests. The produce is the best.",1
"This is so far one of the best coffee shops I've visited since i moved to Vegas 3 months ago. I also had one of their breakfast burritos which was very good. The price for both came down to around $11 which wasn't too bad. I had an orange latte that tasted very good, and not like other places where you can immediately tell they used artificially flavored syrups. Will definitely come back for more!",1
"This is our first summer since having our house sealed last year. In previous years we saw about 10-12 scorpions in the house each summer. In the spring we saw 2 scorpions in upstairs bedrooms. Seal Out Scorpions had mentioned that a few more might be seen when the weather warmed up and would be coming out of hibernation from attic spaces, etc. We were assured that this summer would be much different than prior years. Boy, were they right!!!! We have not seen any scorpions since spring! The only ones we have seen have been outside and dead! What a relief!!!! I feel like I can finally relax in my house again!",1
"By far the best pizzas I have ever had. Such creative flavours!! I've tried Butter Jan Jam, MF Prashoots and the Kung-fungi and they were all so delicious and memorable in their own way. Especially the Butter Jam Jam - who knew those ingredients would taste so amazing together! Also, the staff are so friendly and welcoming!! You have to come here. I can't believe I've lived here all my life and have not gone until now!",1
"I love the homey feeling of this place- the burgers are great and have real flavor to them. I'm not a fan of the sweet potato fries simply because I don't like sweet potatoes, but I hear they are the best. I am a fan of the baked potato fries however- complete with bacon, sour cream and chives. SO awesome. Breakfast is also a treat there- tastiest eggs in Arizona!",1
Recently bought my tickets to go back to LV and having another go at Wicked Spoon may have been the biggest influence :). I have no idea where the negative reviews are coming from. I am darn picky and have worked in a fine hotel kitchen in my younger days and LOVE Wicked Spoon. The details in the presentation and flavor are outstanding and so memorable. Can't wait for round #2!,1
"We came here looking for a nice hot meal on a cold day and were very impressed. My boyfriend and I both had the lunch special (only $6.25!), orange chicken and pork with spicy garlic sauce. They both come with soup and your choice of steamed or fried rice, noodles, or a combo of either. I did a combo of fried rice and noodles with my orange chicken. The food comes out steaming hot right out of the wok. The chef is visible right behind the counter cooking the food at very high heat. The orange chicken was flavorful and delicate, unlike some orange chicken that can be a little overbearing. The pork with garlic sauce had a good combination of flavors to compliment the garlic flavor. Portions are large so come hungry and you will leave happy. We also had a taste of the chicken wings appetizer which was really good as well. We had a good amount of leftovers to bring home and enjoy later. The service is very warm and inviting also!!",1
"Best Chinese food I've had in the valley so far! I've been reading reviews on Phx New Times and searching for good Chinese food. I'm  so tired of the really greasy warmed over weird meat overly salty Chinese food I've had in the valley. Chou's had really good reviews so we went to the one in Tempe. There were a lot of Chinese families eating there so I took that as a Good sign the food will be pretty darn delicious and authentic. We were seated promptly and ordered the beef pies, pork xiao long bao, won ton noodle soup, and beef chow mein. The beef pies are to die for! Savory, juicy, piping hot, and crispy yet soft! Wow these were good! The won ton noodle soup was really yummy. You can tell they used a bone broth in the soup which adds more flavor overall. The pork xiao long bao came out hot, I waited for it to cool down and took a bite of these little pieces of heaven. They had a wonderful little meatball inside with delicious juice that explodes with flavor in your mouth! I had 8 of them before I had to call it quits. There's 10 total. The beef chow mein was also really great! The noodles were perfectly al dente, the perfect amount of oil and sauce, and so much flavor! I'm already craving more. Don't hesitate to eat here!",1
"The most seamless car rental experience ever.  The agents were super friendly and helpful, and it was really easy getting the car, dropping off, etc.  Recommend.",1
I've been a member at this location for years.  Always great service and RMs at this location.  Its clean and friendly. Only recommendation is i've been to 4 other locations and realised that the only location that has the maternity pillow available was in Oakville.  I hope they invest in one at this location as that would just top the whole experience.,1
This was a great place to spend an afternoon on the patio after sharing a sampler of the brews. Decided on the Hop Knot and the Hefeweizen as our favorites of the day.The wait staff was knowledgeable about the brew selections.  Thank you! We shared a platter of walleye that was very good also.Definitely a must try if you find yourself in the area and want a dose of off campus life.,1
"Halloween complete! Everything from dollar tree in these photos except the blacklights and red light. All skeletons, mummies, glow sticks witches and big ghosts! All dollar tree! Made our work 60 foot hallway awesome!",1
Used to be an unknown gem. Not much anymore. Got nails done Saturday and nail polish peeled by Sunday. Went back for a touch up and now Tuesday morning 4 nails are losing polish.Guess regular polish is cheap and you'll have to get gel for it to last not worth 55.00 mani-pedi. Will be going elsewhere today to get a new polish job.,1
"My Pie has become my ""go to"" place for pizza.  The pizza is delicious and the perfect size for one person.  I usually get it to go as I'm stopping by on my way home from work and want to get into my pjs as soon as possible.    The staff is so friendly.  I like that they recognize me as a regular.  I use to order the same pizza all the time but they have encouraged me to try new ones and even got me hooked on their salads.",1
"My wife said it best, ""That was so amazing I wish I could throw it all up just so I could eat it all again."" Seriously though, the meal I just had here was amazing. I've lived in Phoenix off and on for about 7-8 years, first time I'd ever been to Fuego, and it is, by faaaaaar, what I consider one of, if not the, best restaurant in town. I can't wait to try there again just to really see if they put out incredible food like I had this evening each and every night. If they do, I'll be eating here on a weekly basis. Awesome food. Our waiter (tall skinny guy) was awesome, patio is really nicely done, live music could've been better, but all in all 5 out of 5 stars here. Great little restaurant!",1
This was one of the most satisfying meals I have ever had and I cannot wait to go back! The Chicken & Waffles were incredible.,1
Came to crab corner today for lunch andtried the crab cakes and the bacon wrapped scallops! They were absolutely delicious! Crab cakes were all meat and no filler and broiled to perfection! Jeremy and AJ were on top of refills and anything else we needed. Overall excellent service and fantastic crab cakes and scallops. Will definitely be back!,1
"Tried the Mongolian beef and the juicy pork dumplings.. so so good. Great service. Quiet at 7pm on a Sunday night, perfect spot, just wish there was one in west phoenix. Easily best Chinese food I've had in AZ.. and I'm a food loving local. Will be back for more of those mouth watering pork dumplings!",1
"Great customer service, great ambiance, great food! Would recommended any day of the week!!! And their delivery service is top notch.",1
"Sure, you're skeptical because you are about to dine at a restaurant attached to a men of a certain age retail outfit. Put aside your fears because the drinks will knock your socks off. The Aloha Hour daily between 4-6pm is the only way to go. My favorite drink is the Mai Tai followed by the Crazy Cuban. The fish tacos are my absolute favorite but there are a number of other food selections for Aloha Hour like the hummus trio.The staff are some of the best in the area. So much that the manager came out and talked with each table and worked alongside the waitstaff to ensure success.",1
Please do not support southwest autism research center. They would rather have me pick up my phone rather than possibly getting kidnapped and there might also be a possible chance of being used for human trafficking. That's why I wasn't answering the phone to Southwest autism research staff. They would rather not let you have an escape route of being kidnapped from your room  at midnight tonight which is total bullshit. I am also pissed because one of the staff here bribed me in paying for another students transportation and I am down 900 bucks which the girl with black hair said l would be reimbursed by the other person but never was. Yes I am also autistic.,1
"My husband and I went here for restaurant week.  This restaurant was amazing.  I am a picky eater and send back food regularly, making my husband want to hide under the table.  This place was AMAZING.  You will not find this food anywhere. Unique recipes, inspired and delicious. My appetizer was a scallop with pickeled jalapeno with thinly sliced orange.  The spicey jalapeño mixed with the tangy orange was a delicious heat coupled with the cool orange was just a delicious flavor profile. The presentation of every dish was so pretty too!  I had the crispy duck for the main course, a nice size portion of crispy and juicy duck with this amazing cherry chipotle sauce! The roasted creamy parsnips was coated in a crusted breading that was just happiness on my tastebuds.  For dessert I had the chipotle chili brownie with avocado ice cream.  The chili brownie was crisper on the outside and soft with a nice chewy inside. Avocado ice cream sounded weird, but surprisingly it was pleasantly yummy! The place has a nice casual unique ambiance, friendly staff. Hands down my new favorite restaurant.  They switch up their menu seasonally. Seriously try this place. The food is YUMMY!!!!!! If I could pick more than five stars I would.",1
"Excellent authentic Greek food. Service is always charming. Try the veal chops, the rapini, the pikilia or anything else that strikes your fancy. Browse the glass counter and choose your fish and meat.",1
Danny at Devious Designs was amazing. My car looks great and was fixed for a decent price.  Thank you for everything!,1
"AMAZING!  They have a functioning Tandoor (clay oven of Pakistani and Indian origin) which they make fresh Naan (flat bread), and I recommend highly the garlic naan with cilantro.  Mix that with a curry of your choice (the goat and chicken tikka are particularly good) and you're in as authentic a Pakistani restaurant as you're going to find in the Valley.  You are going here for the food not so much the ambiance.  Although it has a really good halaal (kosher) butcher shop and international food market attached to it, it is really authentic.  That's what makes this a diamond in the rough.  The owners know the meaning and true essence of hospitality.  Something lacking in most restaurants.  I send EVERYONE and their mom here who likes ""Indian"" food and has never had Pakistani food.  Which is better, and includes beef dishes.  Northern Indian cuisine is similar.Check it out, and save the travel expenses and stamps on your passport :)",1
"We hosted a Mother's Day lunch here. Since everyone flew in for graduation on Mother's Day weekend, we wanted to make it extra special. Met Chef Giovanni 2 days before event to plan the menu. We felt like family right away, everyone welcomed us. It was like walking into his home kitchen and dining room. He was lighthearted and jovial. Promised us a spectacular lunch and did he ever followed through. We started out with arugula salad with burrata with arugula, carpaccio, bresaola, deep fried calamari and grilled calamari and porchetta which was a meal in itself. Then came the main entree of grilled New York steak perfectly med. rare with sides of roasted potatoes/veggies, amazing clam spaghetti olive white wine and fusilli calamari red sauce ( bread to wipe up all the sauce). Giovanni gave us a taste of Italian sashimi which he only serve Saturdays( I don't think it's on the menu). OMG ,fresh halibut, ahi tuna and calamari with creamy garlicky hot sauce. Polish it off with cappuccino, cannolis, pistachio cake, tiramisu ,coconut cake and dark chocolate almond bark. Wish we had enough room to try more desserts. What a way to end a beautiful graduation and Mother's Day weekend. Thanks Giovanni and staff for making our event extra special.",1
Just walked up upon this little gem. Felt like I was eating at a friends house. The owner was walking around having us taste different pasta dishes. The staff was friendly and attentive. The bread was hot and amazing and everything we chose was so fresh and nummy. We had a salad that we shared and we still didn't eat it all. The same happened with our pasta entree we shared and didn't finish. After we were all done they brought us fresh fruit . We loved it and we would  make this a weekly destination if we lived in Cleveland.,1
Craig was able to help immediately. The Simon Law Group was fantastic to work with and filled with the utmost professionals who are not going to give you the runaround. I highly recommend giving them a call!,1
"Came here with my friends after a fun time down the road at Meepleville after one of their recommendations for their fried rice! I ordered the shrimp fried rice (0 spice, because I personally can't handle it, but the rest got medium spice for their noodles or fried rice) and wasn't disappointed. Good portion sizes, didn't wait long, and they kindly split the check for our party. Be back again!",1
"This is a new branch location for Brush Dental on the exterior ground level of the new build of 66 Isabella. With all the positive Google reviews I made an appointment for a cleaning and received helpful navigation for my husband's very poor treatment from our previous dentist. Two days before my appointment I thankfully received a reminder call. At my first appointment Dr. Brian answered every question and provided advice for my home routine with a clear, everyday language. All the diagnostic tools and instruments are advanced beyond every dental office I've been and I believe assisted in the discovery and treatment of missed issues by my previous dentist I had visited only a month prior. The hygienist provided the best cleaning I've ever had, the assistant helped in every way like anticipating a tissue need after rinsing and the cheerful receptionist explained billing and appointment follow-up before leaving. Thank you, Brush Dental, for making my smile and experience AMAZING!",1
I love this place! I always sit at the bar and order from Kim. She's gangster and never gets my order wrong. I can call ahead of time and she always saves a spot for me. Chips and Guacamole is bangin and the vegan menu is pretty decent. Love you guys you are my official local spot for life!!! Keep up the good work!,1
"Loved it Loved it Loved it!!!!!  While it was pricey at a little over 200 hundred for two people and only lasted about 15 minutes, it was worth every penny, and I'd do it again in a heart beat.  My husband and I did the city lights tour and it was amazing.  So beautiful.  Our pilot was really cool and funny as well.  I think he could tell I was nervous.  I don't normally like to fly (in airplanes that is) or heights in general, but he put us all at ease and the flight was smooth and steady.  As long as all flights are like the one we took, I think I've officially feel in love with flying in helicopters.",1
"My favorite place to go whenever I'm in Vegas. Best place to get AYCE sushi!!! Fish to rice portion is very good. All the sushi tastes yummy too. I tried to keep note what I ordered, but I lost track in the end. Everything is yummy.",1
One of the best pies in town. If your looking for New York style look no further.  The staff does a great job and turn around time is extremely quick.,1
"Yummy food, great beer choice, fast service, friendly wait staff! This place was a true find! The cobbler was delicious and HUGE serving!",1
"Visiting from Pittsburgh and decided to try based on location and the Yelp reviews. And absolutely satisfied. A very nice, non-flashy, well decorated seating area, very polite and smiling staff... and great food. I had the Garlic Tofu as I eat vegetarian, and my friend ordered the Basil Chicken, at spice levels 7 and 8 respectfully. Food arrived quickly, and hot...both temperature and at the spicyness levels we'd requested. So for some excellent Thai food in an environment that lets your mind focus on the taste, I highly recommend.",1
"My first appt with the office was everything I would want in a dental office. The staff was friendly and kind, Dr. Marra, was patient, knowledgeable and listen to all of my concerns and the therapy dogs!!!!! Best part of my day - totally helped with my dental anxiety. I would highly recommend Foothills Family Dental!!!",1
"The restaurant is beautiful inside and has a cozy atmosphere.  Service was great and included a talk about the different cuts of meat available which was very informative. Extensive wine list. We had the scallops which were amazing - perfectly cooked and flavorful, followed by the butcher's block cut (market price) and ahi tuna with truffle mac and cheese, bacon scalloped potatoes, and beets. The meat was fantastic and melt in your mouth (according to boyfriend). I had the tuna, which I didn't have huge expectations for at a steakhouse, but it was delicious as well. The beets and truffle mac and cheese were yummy and satisfying, but would skip the bacon scalloped potatoes next time. No live music when we went (which I'm grateful for) and overall was worth the bigger price.",1
"I think I have tried most of their menu by now, and I love it. French toast, Huevos Rancheros special, the Beny's Special breakfast sandwich or one of their Paninis are some my favorites with a Cappuccino. Great food and great place.",1
"Thank you Tiabi, I had such a great time with my friends and I. The ice coffee was awesome. The waffle was awesome. I got the breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage and added avpcado and it was delicious. I'm definitely coming back here again and I recommend people trying this place. It's not too expensive like other breakfast cars. The pricing is very fair.",1
"Reading some of the reviews I am a bit surprised of some of the comments regarding owners, lack of electrical supplies from folks who seem to have only one review on this site.  This location and staff are warm, and friendly. They consistently remember our order and go out of their way to please. The food is fresh and amazing, such as the lentil soup (pictured), whiskey peacan tarts and giant cups or awesome cappuccino (took the decaf option), and sugar free option cookies. Even a rainy Family Day like today, at night, the joint is jumping! In the heart of the plaza, you can enjoy the awesome light 'ball' and other activities throughout the season. So before looking at low reviews because of a light socket, please keep in mind that there needs to be a degree of turnover for a business to be successfull. If you want to loiter for a few hours there is the awesome Toronto Public Library a few doors down on Lawrence and Don Mills.",1
"It was an awesome experience. Food, house cava and the cocktails were all very good. Warm pumpkin and walnut salad is a must try. We were literally blown away, specially given the fact that I am not a big fan of pumpkin. Foie Gras was expensive but was extremely good and so were the rest of the food. I would recommend this place.",1
"First off, Le Reve is not a Cirque Du Soleil show, nor did Steve Wynn buy the rights FROM Franco Dragone. He hired Dragone himself to work for Wynn and create this show along with his production team. That already says alot. Second, this review will completely disregard prices as I got these tickets for free for working for a ticketing agency.This show is by far my absolute favorite Las Vegas show. There is no bad seat in the house and it makes you feel like you're in this aquatic dream world. The production and design is amazing, the dancing is flawlessly executed, and so are the acrobatic stunts. I choose this show over any other show I've ever seen in Las Vegas... and there's a ton of em. I know I said got the tickets free but I would pay for this show multiple times, idc.",1
"Firefly is the type of place that fills my heart with warm fuzzies when I think about it. Each time I've visited Vegas, I've dined here, and it has always -- always -- been worth it.On my most recent visit, we made a reservation through Open Table, which worked out perfectly.  Even on a Tuesday evening, the place was hopping.  We were seated immediately and attended to by friendly staff.  We split the red sangria and ordered an assortment of small plates, including the following: Firefly fries, mushroom tart, manchego mac 'n' cheese, fried calamari, and lamb chops.  Per usual, everything was fantastic, especially the mushroom tart.We rounded out our meal with caramel flan and banana-Nutella sandwiches. If you try nothing else here, order. the. banana. nutella. sandwiches. So perfect. And entirely worth it.Overall, I would sing Firefly's praises to the highest heavens.  If you're in Vegas, make sure to include it on your must-see list.",1
This place has great food. The service was exceptional as well. They gave us some samples and it worked!  We got to try a couple things we may not have ordered otherwise and they were very good. We will definitely be going back!,1
"I came here on a Sunday at 6.  Totally dead which is sad because the food and service were so good.  Maybe it picked up after I left?The bread was excellent and I usually don't like bread at Italian restaurants.  They had a focaccia, ciabiata, standard loaf, and crazy one with meat in it.  As a vegetarian I had the first 3.  In addition there were 3 dips - an amazing butter, a eggplant option, and citrus infused EVOO.I began with the white artichoke soup.  Great presentation.  Mushrooms and croutons with a nice foam and greens, then came the creamy artichoke soup.  Cleaned the bowl.Then the famed spaghetti.  The $24 spaghetti that apparently is amazing.  I had to find out for myself.  I hadn't ordered spaghetti from an Italian restaurant in a decade (in high school I'd order it on dates to save money).  It was honestly - ok.  I found mine to be too al dente, but perhaps this is personal taste and preference.  Still good pasta - but don't feel like you have to get the spaghetti.The service was great.  The waiter was quick, knowledgable, and professional.  The manager came over and chatted with me for 15 minutes which was great.They sat me at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains - can't complain about that.Go here.  So you can say you ate at Scott's place and because it's delicious.",1
"Definitely one of the best falafel bowls I've had in a while, I like the fact that you can pick what you want in it. Also the baklava is super yummy and if you get a chance try their cucumber chiller it's very refreshing and delicious not to mention healthy, this is coming from someone who's not a fan of cucumbers. The location is very easy to find and I thought it was cool that they had F*R*I*E*N*D*S playing on the tv.",1
"We were very pleased with their services and glad that someone else posted a review to help make up our mind. Our 75"" TV looks great on the family room wall. I can now enjoy viewing it from my kitchen as well, due to my deteriorating eyesight. No more squinting to see the football scores either. I ordered my bracket through Amazon. The only thing that was delayed was me posting this review. My TV has been hanging up since Jan 2015, and I've been happy about it ever since.",1
The food is always good! Hot sauce is great!!The Al pastor burrito is one of the best things I've had!! I always look forward to Thursday and that burrito!,1
Outstanding pastrami and corned beef on freshly rolls. I was sceptical of the ratings when walker. Glad I was wrong. Very friendly people as well.,1
The freshest sushi I have ever had. I come here often love the cherry blossom roll and I've tried about every roll here.,1
"I was going to sit here and write a detailed review touching on a little of everything, but to sum it up...it's amazing and you're missing out if you haven't ever been. Service is seriously unmatched..everyone in the building has a job and they are on it! You will wait on nothing, but meat to be sliced off on your plate. Before you can finish one slice another is surely on it's way....If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse expect it to be busy and I assure you, you will return. It's an experience good for any occasion.I appreciate that I can come in my t-shirt and jeans and not feel out of place eating an upscale meal. You can dress up if you'd like but you don't HAVE to and I appreciate that! It's great for parties, families and business...I loveeee this place...but be advised your gonna spend some $$ here. Don't worry it's worth every penny..come hungry..verrry hungry!!!!",1
"First time eating here and got the High Maintenence which come with 3 scoop of yellowtail, 3 scoop of spicy tuna,guac,crispy wonton,and other condiments. The owner is Chef John Lee who also has another sushi restaurant SOHO. All I can say is both of his restaurant is very great. That right not very good but very Great!  Will be back to try other sushi burrito.",1
This company did an excellent job cleaning my carpet and my area rugs they look very good the men were quick professional and when they were running late they called immediately. I would consider using them again in the future for sure,1
Came here with my family for my daughters 8th birthday.  The service was exceptional.  The food was great the presentation of the dishes were very nice.  The staff is very friendly bilingual Chinese and English.  Overall great experience.,1
Excellent chopped salad and short ribs,1
I've gone to two different nail places before this one and nothing beats Nuvo Nails. I've been going here for about a year and a half now and love the services and colours they provide. I used to get the shellac nail polish but was recently suggested the dipping by one of the nail technicians. I'm so glad I made the change. My nails are stronger and the manicure lasts 3-4 weeks without chipping. Lucy does an amazing job and meticulously checks that all the nails are done well and of even shape and size. Make sure to book an appointment as they are busy later in the day.,1
"This place was awesome, very decent sushi surprisingly and a good variety too. Desserts were plentiful, make youre own salad bar and good food buffet also. Big so it wont keep you waiting and the lines move fast. Service for plate pickup was in a timely manner also. Ill definitely be returning here someday.",1
"We were looking for a good sandwich place when we moved to Las Vegas, and we found it!!! Great variety, delicious bread (Dutch Crunch is my fav ever), and friendly staff. Relaxed atmosphere, good music. So happy.",1
"One of the must try places in Vegas! Whether its Friday night at 4am after the club, or 12pm Saturday afternoon after a long night, Earl's tastes good at any hour of the day. It's the perfect meal for your empty stomach. My favorite is the Club and the Caprese. I usually get 1 and my friend gets the other, and we trade one side. The combination of the Club and Caprese is perfect! The Caprese runs a little heavy on the balsamic vinegar, while the Club has a lot more of a hearty taste. Too much of one thing ruins the entire meal. So the half/half idea is a good one.Chips + dessert. You're all set! Best deal in Vegas...",1
"This place is delicious! The bone marrow, charcuterie, and mackerel were fabulous. Share everything. Also, get there as soon as it opens as it gets crowded early...even on a Sunday night.  Its also the BEST service I have had in Toronto.",1
Awesome bagels! Super quick and friendly. Great variety of cream cheese flavors. Does not disappoint!,1
Such a great concept with food that actually tastes good! All of the options tasted amazing and although I'm not a vegetarian I ended up choosing that option for my meal. Really friendly environment and beautiful aesthetic.,1
My fiancé and I were engaged during our trip to Montreal. We visited Fieldstone at the suggestion of our Air BnB host. The food and service was exceptional without the snooty or pretentious vibe. I would definitely eat here again on my next visit--especially for the signature dessert.,1
"I recently moved to Vegas so I've been looking around for a nail place and new nail tech and I want to say Jasmine the Nail tech is amazing at her work, very kind, sweet, and her work speaks for itself. She's hands down the best nail tech I've had. The salon is very nice and comfortable, I give them 5 stars!",1
Yas! My roomie and I order from her at least two times a week. Fried catfish greens Mac and a red koolaid is all I want for Xmas. Or forever. Please do t pass this gem . Oh and the banana pudding is hella dank.,1
We have been coming since they opened day one. My seven year old and my brother have both gotten their hair done here twice a month. They always do a great job. Sometimes you can tell some of them don't want to be there but they are always great at what they do.,1
"I wanted to purchase some macarons for my dear friend in Kirtland, Ohio. After searching the web, I found Coquette Patisserie. I emailed Britt-Marie if she could mail the cookies to my friend if I paid for the shipping costs. Britt said for a small fee she would have them delivered to my friend's home. I live in Fort Worth, Texas and we just don't not have this kind of customer service at all. Britt has gone  above and beyond to make this experience special for me and my friend. I highly recommend this bakery for any of your needs. I can't wait to visit in person when I am in Cleveland.",1
"Came here for an event (Plant Nite) and Crab Corner was the perfect venue. Ashley, our server/bartender did a great job keeping track of all the orders that were coming at her (there were a lot of us!) and had such a great energy and sense of humor, she definitely added to our event experience!",1
"This was a great experience start to finish. We got a booth which is located 2 tables from the windows with the amazing view, it was really nice. I got a glass of wine and my boyfriend ordered a Manhattan. He said it was one of the best he has ever had. The bread was delicious and warm but the butter was seasoned and really good, I may have filled up too much on that. We ordered classic raw oysters and a crab cake to share for appetizers. They are known for their crab cakes and I can certainly see why. I would have definitely eaten that as my entree happily. A lot of the entrees have a couple different choices on how it can be prepared. I got the red snapper Mediterranean style, it was good. He got the sea bass and loved it. Then we couldn't decide on a dessert so we got the raspberry chocolate torte and then passionfruit icebox cake to go. And the service was phenomenal. I felt like I couldn't take a sip of water without someone filling it back up. It was such an attentive staff and enjoyable experience. The view was killer and we loved the incline ride over.",1
Always a winning selection when you need a bagel fix. I try to go on Saturday or Sunday when they make sweet and sour cabbage soup. Omg it's to die for !!! Chicken salad on a sesame seed bagel is another favorite. You can never go wrong with the food or the service here.,1
Keeping my son fresh for back to school!  Thanks Jae u can keep my extra $10  drinks is on u tho lol no wait this time and kept me entertained.. cool conversation and my boys look good so I'll let u keep the 5 star review!!,1
"Some of the other reviews got me pretty worried, but everything in the car rental process went SUPER smooth... the airport shuttle to/from the rental office, paperwork, getting my car, returning the car, etc. Great experience and FANTASTIC price!BTW, shuttle driver was SUPER nice and friendly. Only had to wait about 10 minutes for the shuttle to their office and got lucky that we didn't have to wait at all on the way back to the airport, even with our late-night flight.",1
"Do you lick your lips when eating spicey foods? Stop!  Unless you enjoy the burn, lol. Being a local, I've been a fan of Lotus of Siam for years since their original location off Eastern Avenue. This location is much more modern and upscale and the company who did the work did and amazing job! Now on to the food!  This visit I ordered the least amount of food of any visit, my daughter and I were dining and she eats like a bird!! Nomally, I come with 5 or more people and we try new things every time!  Everything is always wonderful but there's so much going on that I never get a chance to take pictures before someone digs in and changes the beautiful presentation! Next time just for the people who bother to read my review, I do solemnly swear to take great food pictures and present some incredible things you must try! Back to this review, no more tangents...We started with Thai tea and it tasted exactly the way it would taste in Thailand (yes. I've been) we also ordered the Pad Prik King with chicken, spice level 3 which was perfect for me but a bit much for my girl. Next, we orded the Green Curry with chicken which was delicious but a little spicy again for my girl but it had such a great flavor, she ate it anyway! I think the rice helped cut the spice a bit.  Lastly, for dessert,  we ordered the mango sticky rice, it's always on point here...I forgot to order coconut ice cream on the side as I love those flavors combined!  If you're not used to sweets, this can potentially be a sugar overload and might be better shared.  Finally, if you love Thai food, look no further and if you need suggestions ask the server or any staff, they are all great, lovely people and will take care of you!  My favorite staff whom I  always enjoy are Brittany, April, Mike and Supershai...thanks Everyone at Lotus for the great job you do!",1
"We had such a wonderful dinner at Nook Kitchen. We went on a Sunday evening and the hostess had informed us that they had been short staffed. We decided to stay and give this place a try and we are so glad we did! The atmosphere is great! We started off with some drinks from the bar, all of which were delicious! Our table ordered several starters and bruschetta instead of entrees. We enjoyed everything we ordered! The food was presented wonderfully and tasted even better. Not to mention, the staff was SO attentive!! We had never noticed that they were short staffed because they did a great job at making us feel like we were important to each person that came by our table. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Once they found out it was my daughters birthday they all made sure to say happy birthday to her also  We will definitely be returning to Nook Kitchen once we're back in town!!",1
"All I can Say is AWESOME. I am rating this a 5 star for flavor. Now my friends don't have to put up with my picky eating habits! Can you leave off the____, add some____ and some of ____ on the side? If you are a sauce person like me, ask for more than one scoop or you will miss the amazing taste. I have never seen such a small ladle! They are quite stingy on the sauce so I ask for 3 scoops :) A bigger ladle perhaps?Where else can you go to get whatever you want on your pizza and it is the perfect size for one person. Annnnnnnnnd has an awesome crust (not too thin) and FLAVOR!!! for $8.00? Certainly NOT Pizza Bianco!It does get really crowded after 5 with screaming kids and soccer moms so we usually go mid day or get it to go. The line does go fast though. We were ""gym shopping"" the day we went for lunch. Yes I know, the hypocrisy was just oozing that day. This is Noelle reporting from Chandler, AZYUM!P.S. The photos on here are considered to be food porn by most Stoners so they should only be viewed by mature adults who haven't been smoking anything. ;D",1
Great food! The lady owner is very kind and nice. I order their House Special Fried Rice once a week and it's the tastiest fried rice I ever had in my life. Other dishes are great too and very affordable price!!! Thank you New Chen Wok!,1
"Thank you so much Kim!!! They are beautiful. If I lived out in Arizona I would come back to her always. Unfortunately I live in California, but I know where I'll be coming when I visit grandma again!!  There was a little bit of a wait because we walked in on a Sunday morning.. but nothing crazy. I think the pricing for this set and gel manicure was 50 dollars which is a little pricey but it's very clean so I'll gladly pay to be comfortable.",1
"The first time I went on Saturday it was just average. The burger I had was ok but the fries were great. Everybody's meal was average. Got a gift card and decided to combine it with the $10 off $35 deal they have going on. I went back with my sister last night just to use the gift card. Initially I was only going to get the beignet since that's the one thing I did enjoy during my first visit, but I saw the pizza on the menu and decided I would give it a try. The pizza I had was greeeeaattt! I can't wait to go back I've been craving it ever since I left. My sister got the ahi poke and salad and she really liked her food this time as well.",1
"Always happy with the service! Techs are super friendly! Best to call ahead to make an appointment, they get busy fast!",1
"A huge shout-out to Lea Lana Gutierrez from Lea Lana's Bananas. The frozen bananas were the PERFECT July 4th treat  (actually, the perfect anytime treat). Plus she delivered them to me so I didn't have to leave the office to go pick up. If you are in Las Vegas do not waste another second... You will thank me later!",1
The best barber shop in Cave Creek. I'm never disappointed with my haircut. You can call ahead and reserve a spot with your favorite barber or walk in and be called in a timely manner.,1
"Two in Two, i went for Lunch twice in the same week! Yes! Its THAT good. The service is super friendly and really fast!  Yes there is always a lineup at the door, but do not worry about it too much, its never too long (for lunch) to get seated and the staff is very kind and understanding. The food (I've had Beef Rib & ramen) is delicious, well platted and very very tasty. The serving is perfect for a good eater like myself and the kitchen brigade is really good and fast on operation. you never wait for more than 10 mins for your food to arrive! I highly recommend you sit at the bar and interact with the brigades, its a lot of fun! I have yet to experience a ""dinner"" there, but its definitely on my list. I will be a frequent customer at this place! Main dish + beer + sweet for less than 30$ is very affordable for the experience. Finally a ""real"" japanese restaurant that serves (proudly) other things than sushi (for us westerners) and i'm told by friends who went to Japan that this is ""as close to the real deal"" as we're getting in MTL. Major High Five Kazu! I'm sold!",1
"This is the best restaurant I have tried in the past few months in Madison. It is authentic hot pot from what I can tell--(the only other place I've had hot pot is in inner Mongolia) and is a fun concept/date night. Very vegetarian friendly, I got the mixed vegetable (yu choy, 3 types of mushroom, 3 types tofu, napa cabbage)--it was enough for 2+ people. There are an assortment of broths to choose from. I tried the Szechuan, which was spicy, a bit oily, but delicious. Next time I would like to try the coconut. They have a noodle/sauce bar so you can amend your creation (ramen were the best noodle, but they have rice noodles as well). The restaurant is family owned and operated--they are very friendly and accommodating.They also have bubble tea. Try it!",1
"I love their stylish clothes. I often look for clothings that are more classic in design. I enjoyed browsing through the women's wear and found several blouses and dresses. Staff was really helpful and kind. When you walk in on the left side section is for ladies and on the right side for gentlemen. In the back near the cashiers are dresses on sale and handbags, jewelry and shoes. Will come back someday again. In total clean and organized.",1
"One of my favorite places in Charlotte for NY style pizza. I'm from NJ so every time I eat here I feel like I'm home. The crust and sauce are delicious and perfect. They have reasonably priced slices and the entrees are a bit overpriced but delicious. The chicken parm is nothing short of fantastic. I always order a large salad so I can get some of the bread and dip it in the house dressing, which is also great. They have a great variety of pizza slices available unlike many of the areas pizza places that usually only have plain and pepperoni on hand and everything else has to be made to order.Try the white pizza. They make it very well here!",1
The AAA folks at the PV office are always friendly and helpful.  They treat customers as friends and always offer to help with any other questions you might have about travel.  I have been a AAA member for close to twenty years and the service I experience has always been consistent.,1
"I love Bree and her staff. When ever I need something, they are always ready to help. Haven't had to go anywhere else for my insurance needs and that is a good thing. Plus, it's State Farm - win win situation. Thanks",1
I was excited when I saw Ding Tea in Las Vegas! I was in need for milk tea! I ordered the usual when I'm in OC.Hokkido Oolong Milk Tea was perfection. If you're long away from home/ milk tea. Stop by Ding Tea in LV.,1
"Tony was our server tonight and was amazing!!!! Food,prices,and service is awesome!!! Definitely a spot to check out if your in the chandler area.",1
"As a student from Sichuan, I have to say that Sichuan Gourmet is a reeeaaaally good Chinese restaurant that provides authentic and delicious Sichuan cuisine - the taste is just the same as it is in Sichuan. Strongly recommended for those who want to have a taste of Sichuan.",1
Amazing food and amazing service. The steak and the chicken taco was full of amazing flavor. The toppings offered are just as good. Be careful with the red hot sauce. It will hurt you. Can't wait to go back,1
"I bookmarked Bela Vista when I saw Jonathan's review, and walked over there with my Mom today. Fresh crispy Natas will get me out the door, guaranteed. And these were wildly worth the walk. We tried the maple, chocolate, nature, and coconut and they were all great. The classic ones are wonderful, but the coconut blew my mind. My new favourite thing, just the perfect medley of flavours. They are all fresh and crispy and just so good.I loved the space too, big and full of sunlight with a DJ playing records in the front and all these cool tough hipstery guys working here being just so lovely to my chatty mom. Can't wait to go back!",1
Great service and excellent job on our golf plaques. The plaques were ready before the promised date. The store has awards for every sport.,1
Great service! Everyone was very friendly and there was no wait. They were able to do my nails while I got my pedicure. Big time saver! It was a clean and relaxing environment. I will be back.,1
"I can't say enough good things about super star car wash! The best full service car wash around! My family has been visiting this location for over a year (since we moved to the area), and we absolutely love it! I'm a mom of 3, and they have a super comfy area to sit and watch tv. We also get our it changed there, and they throw in a free full service car wash. Also, they are always giving me coupons to make their low prices even cheaper.",1
"I went here a few weeks ago and arrived late. I didn't have to wait and all the staff were very friendly. Nick gave me an amazing pedicure and my only reason for not reviewing sooner is because I like to see how long the polish lasts and without gel it still lasted nearly 4 weeks without chipping! Great, relaxing environment and just round the corner from my house. I will be asking for Nick when I'm back in town.",1
"Menu variety awesome! Best to go at opening time as place is small and it gets really busy! Must try bulgogi nachos and the shake shake rice under appetizers. Hwaro premium steak meat, short ribs, and spicy pineapple beef steak was flavorful! Great place to eat, socialize, and listen to k-pop and other todays hits lol! Wait staff are on top of it, keeps grill clean. Dined in 3X and will always return. Small joints like this always great! =)",1
"Love Dynasty! If you're getting acrylics and deciding between here and Tiptoe, definitely choose here. Walk-in service is fast and the quality is excellent. Everyone who does nails also does acrylics, and they won't burn your cuticles off with the grindy thingy. (Which Tiptoe did!!) It's not exactly one of those places you go to get pampered and served champagne among dim lighting and quiet music - it's for when your polish is chipped and your acrylics are on their last legs and you need them fixed and looking great in a short amount of time for a reasonable price. Go here!!!",1
"Clean nail spa, professional employees that strive for perfection and they NAILed it. Marina is the best at pedicures and Lynn is the best at manicures. This is my new go to spot for manicures and pedicures. Thank you Herbal Nails & Spa for everything",1
"Super clean , professional shop. I have been tattooed by Charlie and have gotten my wife and her 2 friends tattooed since then. Always a great experience. Unlike the ""strip"" there's no attitude or over inflated prices.",1
"I had my first of many appointments here tonight and was blown away by the professionalism and attention to detail I received from Prince! I had a large and very difficult cover up that he completely conquered. I couldn't be happier and have already booked my next appointment. If you're looking for a tattoo artist with amazing skills and is not afraid of a challenge, look no further!!!",1
Amazing food especially if you are gluten free. Atmosphere is amazing and biggie the dog is a great addition all in all I love it will be back for sure.,1
"The try tip (Tuesday/Thursday) is out of this world. Very tender, very flavorful, and an experience onto itself.  Order ahead or expect a 45 minute wait. This place is popular.",1
"Food: Quality of the food is great, for a japanese restaurant the sushi's/ Sashimi's that we tried were really tasty and fresh we had the Golden Ocean Trout and the Tuna Sashimi and they were definitely GREAT!!!Ambiance: Homely atmosphere with great service from the staff. Great with kids.Overall: Definitely try this place if your going for Sashimis and Sushi although they are not EAT ALL YOU CAN, the a la Carte food  is definitely worth the money.",1
"Very clean and staff is very friendly. The manager sorry I forgot her name but I think she is from Hawaii gave very nice service to my family and I. We had the Chicken strips and fries, it was delicious and hot and fresh. I love the sauces it came with. The worker (her name is Kehau) was very attentive. It's our 1st time dining at a DQ and we will be returning to this one when we come back to Vegas. Next time we have to try there cakes, they have a large selection of them.",1
"This place was excellent. I emailed them to tell them I had seen a ring at a vendor who sold their pieces and wanted a consultation. I'm from the US and only had 2 days left in Toronto. Terry emailed me, was very responsive and came in on Sunday before I was due to leave for a consultation. He was kind, patient and very informative. He definitely knew his business. I am so in love with my selection and they made this purchase feel extra special. I would absolutely recommend anyone wanting to purchase jewelry (especially for wedding) to come here!",1
"Like other users have stated you can get Cheese Curds here. Delicious, unicorn-like freshly-made cheese curds! I've had Wisconsin cheese curds, which are basically ""young"" (see: not aged) cheddar. They are supposedly the world's greatest and these are right up there with them. They also sell some cheap milk and many other goodies, considering the dairy factory is right behind this place. I hope everyone in Tempe can visit this location, as some of what they have here are things that require loads of special equipment to make. Not every city has it's own specialty dairy store, you know.",1
"Sorauren Farmers' Market has been my hands-down favourite market in Toronto for the last few years. The site is beautiful, and *you can actually buy your week's groceries there* in a reality where your groceries are not artisanal soaps and tinctures!* Organized by the West End Food Co-op (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/west-end-food-co-op-toronto), I like to swan around in a warm ethical fuzz between lush veggies, formerly happy meats, and the delightful snack mavericks. I recommend showing up with plenty of cash, but only because you'll want to buy so much. Reasonable prices!5 stars for this, and the long tomato sampling table. You know what a woman wants.*You can get those there, though. If that's what you eat.",1
"This is a wonderful place for lunch, happy hour or for dinner with family.  1st the staff and owners are amazing.  They have a Meriachi band on Friday. Lots of drink and food specials manager is super sweet comes by my table every visit",1
"This guy Dave is awesome!! He has a way of exciting you about training your dog well. If you truly listen to what he has to offer! Make time for training every day and go to group classes. And even when you feel stuck, talk about it with Dave and he will surely help you out. He is very knowledgeable in the training feild and will tell you when you are sending your dog mix messages and when your handling your dog properly. Be pateint with yourself and your dog Key note: Dave & collar is most important tool I have ever worked with. My first experience was that I was scared of it and that I was going to hurt my dog after some time Dave could see that i was struggling with this and helped me out, I got over it real quick because I couldn't see results in my dog or myself I finally had to get a strong mind and realize I was not going to hurt my dog but I had to use the collar properly. My experience training with Dave has been amazing and I have surely seen the results in my dog Leo. I take great pride in training him and making him a better pet I am truly pleased with all our work that Dave has shared with us!I feel very confindent with my boy now and i have moved to off leash training. Proud mommy",1
"I've loved Pork On A Fork since the first day I met them at a farmers market.  Their pulled pork & brisket are by far THE BEST anywhere around, and I should know since I am from the midwest where we definitely know BBQ!  I've even got my mother in law hooked & she makes sure to stop by when she is out by their location to get us all some delicious food!",1
Pretty new but can feel chef's enthusiasm about the food. Great taste and decent portion.,1
Great place! The prices are amazing and Nick is fantastic! I buy all my silver and jewelry from Savvy!,1
"I read all of the reviews for this place, and decided to drive down from North Scottsdale and check it out. I am very glad I did.It's true that they have so many cute designs it will make your head spin. But I wanted to say a couple of things based on my experience today, as I felt a few reviews were misleading. First, this salon is very clean. And their inspection report is on the wall behind the register. Second, I had the 'deaf girl' (whose name is CINDY, by the way) for my pedicure today and received the utmost attention and care. Not only did we have no trouble communicating (using common and obvious gestures) but, as I would expect, her disability had no bearing on her skill level. I will be requesting Cindy again. Third, the girls here are shy, not stuck up. I get my nails done enough at resorts to know the difference. If you take the time to say hello, and not jump to conclusions or make assumptions, you will see they clearly are quiet because of the language barrier and are very sweet. Frankly, I find it refreshing. It's much better than the forced chit chat I usually endure at my nail place. Fourth, and most importantly, I received exactly the level of service and end result I would expect for what I paid. Best mani/pedi of my life? Not quite. Was it high quality and worth the money? Absolutely.I believe this place is a gem, and well worth the visit. At least it is for those of us looking for a great nail experience, at a good price, in a clean and pleasant establishment.  I will definitely be going back.  Check it out!",1
"I've been hearing some buzz about this place over the past few months and we decided to check it out.  It lived up to the hype!  The Summit Room is set in what looks like a big old house, and it shares space with this chicken salad place (???).  There is a really nice patio area out front and a big porch with rocking chairs where you can sit and enjoy a cocktail or three.  And you'll probably want three just so you can try as many of the interesting liquid concoctions as you can get down your gullet.  The Cucumber Collins is an excellent summer drink, a delicious twist on a Tom Collins.  Another nice option is the Chocolate Old Fashioned which is a cool take on the classic Bourbon drink. The dining room is small, loud, and happenin'.  If you are looking for an intimate or romantic setting, don't go here.  It's hip and loud and energetic all around.  There are various animal skulls on the walls and a deer head mounted over a doorway - not sure how I feel about all that jazz but whatever I can deal with it for the delicious eats.The grilled zucchini flatbread is money as an appetizer.  So is the now-famous BBQ shrimp appetizer that comes on a slab of corn pudding.  If you have all that PLUS the complementary cheese scones, you are already feeling pretty full.  But you have to hang in there for the main courses.  I had the duck which was really tasty - it came with blueberry grits and wilted spinach.  The wife got this huge piece of wild caught salmon.  Both were spot on.  We didn't have room for dessert after all that, but the desserts looked pretty tasty as well.Summit Room is a cool spot with creative twists on some down-home Southern dishes!",1
"The best pizza I've had in Madison (and several other cities). We got a pizza to-go after having dinner at a place nearby. Even though we'd just eaten dinner, we couldn't stay away from the pizza here. It was fantastic.The end.",1
I had two new suits needed alterations in 24-hours. I was elated by the quality and swift service. We needed a professional tailor and designer here in Laveen and grateful for Laveen Alterations!,1
"Donkey Kong, Tron, Mario, Pac Man? Classics. Good picks. Well done.Mario Kart 64 on comfy dorm furniture? Ooooohhh...""HE'S HEATING UP"". Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition Arcade Machine?

"Jonathan's service was phenomenal! He was beyond helpful, refilling drinks without asking & assisted us to no end. We were in Vegas from New York celebrating our friends 50th birthday. The food was delicious & the hospitality was unmatched. Thank you for a Great Evening Jonathan! You are !",1
"Tony is a great trainer.  He is very concerned with injury prevention and works with people of all ages and abilities.  From the warm up to the post workout stretching, Tony keeps you engaged and moving.  In addition to workouts, he is a great nutrition consultant organizes group activities such as bike rides, runs, batting cages etc.  If you're looking to get in shape, Tony and team forty-four is the way to to.",1
Dana was really helpful & nice friendly helped me pick out a few items & gave me her personal card for any questions,1
Great new place in downtown Chandler. Staff are awesome and the decor and design are spot on.  Now my wife and I are not smokers but we felt very comfortable and invited.  Also hear there will be a TN BBQ place downstairs. Can't wait for the rooftop and balcony areas open up when cooler out.,1
"I tried a number of high-rated, supposedly hip and creative salons in town, only to be disappointed again and again by stylists that just didn't get me or what I wanted.  I was sad and frustrated with hairstylists that either made me look like a soccer mom or tried too hard to make me look what they thought was ""rock and roll"".  I even thought about commuting back to my stylist in LA for haircuts!I've been going to Globe for probably 2-3 years now and am ever-so-thankful that I finally found them!  Samantha is amazing!  I like to change up my style every now and then (I get bored - must be my punk rock roots) and she's always ready to build on my ideas with suggestions that look great!  Creative and just a darn enjoyable person to chat with while getting a great cut - I can't recommend Sam enough.  She has really helped me redefine my personal style and keeps me looking cool as I get older.",1
I have been taking my two German Shepard dogs to candelores for a couple months now and they do such an awesome job on them. I am highly satisfied with how friendly and reasonably priced they are! I will never go anywhere else and I tell everyone I know to take their dogs to candelores!,1
This place is amazing. First I was kinda skeptical on how a thread could take of fine hairs on your face and other parts of your body. Threading for my two daughters and myself is a lot better than the pain of plucking and waxing. We'll definitely continue going there. The people that work there are very knowledgeable and efficient. And the place is very clean with retro decor.,1
Just took my miniature dachshund there this morning and had the best experience. The front desk staff was so nice and welcoming and the Dr. Matthew was amazing. I left feeling so much better and with a solution to my dogs itchiness.,1
"I needed a haircut and a shave. It is 5:50 on a Wed. Those lame chain barber wannabe's won't do it right. I found Buzz Boyz on google and made the drive. First thing I see is that this place is serious about what they do. Old School barber chairs, Wood all around, and TV's everywhere I look. Jonathan the Owner and Barber offers you a cold drink when you walk in (Amazing). The service is top notch. I got a hair cut.. a hot lather shave.. and walked out with my wallet not feeling like it was drained. This is my new barber.",1
"At the first hint that I was feeling better I decided to get some soup to help, but instead of Pho or Matzo Ball, I decided to go Japanese and ventured over to a relatively new place, Cafe Sanuki located at Decatur and Spring Mountain in the space that was formerly ""The End"" bar.WoW! What a TREASURE!You know it's good when there's Japanese people eating there, yet it's VERY ""American Friendly"" which is something that most Asian restaurants aren't.What I mean is that you'll feel very comfortable ordering food here even if you have no clue about Japanese food. When you walk in there's a huge glass display featuring replicas of their most popular products. There are also well crafted booklets available which show and explain each item. There's also video monitors that show the various offerings as well.You won't have to 'guess' what each item is. It's very well shown and explained.Their specialty is Udon, which is a soup featuring thick noodles. There are many varieties, mixed with different items such as veggies, eggs, and meat. Rice bowls are also a tempting offering, and there are sides including, but not limited to various tempura and seaweed wraps ('sushi'... sort of).It's served cafeteria style, meaning you line up with a tray and order. After paying you bring your food to a table.They also have an outstanding selection of soft drinks including an unusual one called Calipo. If you're adventurous but don't like the idea of ordering a drink that you don't know if you'll like, this is a great place to try it out because the drinks are bottomless and self serve. Free drink with Yelp check in, too!Fantastic, authentic Japanese food at a low, low price! (Kake Udon, 2 Tempuras, and a beverage for under $10)",1
"I am impressed with Cilantro Taqueria.The staff is incredibly friendly. They welcome you with a hearty hello, ask you if you have any questions about the menu, and smile throughout their time with you.The food is tasty. I've been twice now and have had different menu items each time. Their al pastor is delicious. It's well-seasoned, slightly sweet, and tender. I also like their carnitas, which is so unctuous, chorizo, which is spicy and salty (in a good way), and the lengua, which has nice flavor and is very tender.Their guacamole is fresh and flavorful. Their queso is creamy and rich. Both are served with a big bag of tortilla chips.Moreover, their price points are reasonable. You can have a nice meal between $10-$15.This is a great place to catch a quick bite to eat or have a casual meal. Cilantro Taqueria is an excellent addition to the east side and greater Cleveland food scene for sure. Eat here. Support local.",1
"My sister and I took out my Mom for her birthday.  My mom had the vegetarian special - a stuffed zucchini filled with cheeses, mushrooms, carrots which she loved which came with a vegetarian tamale, rice and smashed black beans.  She loved it!  My sister had a gorgeously plated green salad with large prawns and a chile relleno.  She gave me a bite - and it was breaded so lightly, very delicious.  I had their two item plate with a chicken tostada, I love it layered with refried beans at the base, cheeses and shredded plump chicken with a chicken enchilada, by the way I love their sauce. It has a bitterness to it, which reminds me of a mole which I almost opted for.My mom said this is one of those places that when you start to eat wonder why haven't come here more often!  The waitress remembered us which made us feel welcome.  And to me customer service is what brings me back and returning to a place I love over and over!Keep it up Frank n Fina's!",1
"Best food, cheap prices and the nicest people you could ask for.  The Spicy Eggplant is incredible, as is everything on their menu.  Highly recommended!",1
Great customer service and pricing. Highly recommended. Fixed all issues I had with my security cameras that were installed by a different company,1
"Every time I've gone to Vegas for trade shows(6) we have come to Sushi Goyemon, $25 a person for all you can eat is great pricing, the sushi is fresh and they sake selection is awesome. The service was great, food came out fast and establishment has alway been clean, I recommend this spot for big groups for sure!",1
"I was pleasantly surprised to be invited to The Rascal House's ""Tasting Party"" today, to sample their new ""Spicy Chicken Bleu Trio"" Menu items! I have always loved The Rascal House's Pizza (which I think is the best in the city of Cleveland) and their sandwich platters very delicious as well! Also, The Rascal House's food presentation is absolutely stunning! My favorite Spicy Chicken Bleu Trio item is the Sandwich Wrap! It isn't quite as spicy as the rest of the new menu items. Perhaps, the wonderful wrap bread cools the spice down just a bit. The flavors are wonderful, the wrap bread is delicious--and it is the perfect compliment to the spicy chicken and delectable Bleu Cheese!My second favorite food item is is the Spicy Chicken Bleu Cheese Sandwich. The crunch of the tasty chicken and the flavor of red onion adds a delicious flavor enhancement, which made my soul happy! Also, the red onion compliments the Bleu Cheese, and adds a wonderful zest.The Spicy Chicken Bleu Pizza is good, and the spice is over-the-top! Spicy food lovers will enjoy it.I love the ambience of this restaurant, because it takes me back to my college days--since it is located in the heart of downtown Cleveland--directly across the street from Cleveland State University's Campus, and steps away from the beautiful PlayHouse Square District.Additionally, I love the staff here! They are all so very friendly! Parking is free during the weekdays, for an hour, if you can find a parking spot on the street out front. And The Rascal House offers free WiFi to their guests.",1
"""I love you so matcha""My first visit to Maiko was in SF JPNTOWN at 10pm with my 4 year old and 7 year old (cool parent right here).  I've been dreaming about the soft serve matcha ever since.  2months later, by accident, I found one while visiting Las Vegas! Wahoo! And since we had a large group with us, we were able to try pretty much one of everything so by the time one opened by my house, I became a Cafe Maiko pro!- Maiko special (mixed)- matcha latte- matcha soft serve - Mixed matcha float - Uji Kintoki",1
"Skimos is such a breath of fresh air, it's a cozy and convenient shop with great tasting coffee.  The staff is accommodating, polite, professional, and prompt.  The diversity of the menu is more than appropriate, offering plenty of options for all types of coffee drinkers without overwhelming.  They have local art available for sale, and it is very modern feeling and impeccably maintained.",1
The vets are so helpful. When I had a problem on the weekend they saw us on Saturday and checked up on us by phone the next day. Would recommend these caring and experienced people to anyone.,1
"Now this is the best place for BBQ pork fried rice, the servers there remember our order every time and our soul prompt with filling up our drinks. Highly recommend this place if you want the best service the best food all around. No wonder they've been around so long their food is amazing",1
"Came to SkyBar for this New Year's celebration.  Hands down, it has THE best view of the Las Vegas strip.  Way up high on the 23rd floor, we could see the entire strip explode with scorching lights as the clock struck midnight. The NYE party was sponsored by Moet, so they had plenty of decorations, balloons, and projections on display inside.  Next to the dance floor, there was a backdrop where a white gloved hand would pop out and hand champagne glasses out to the guests. Our table server/hostess, Ashiana, was the best server we could ask for.  She was super nice, friendly, and helpful--definitely A++ service.   Will definitely be back on a regular night to enjoy the good food, drinks, and most importantly the view.",1
Awesome customer service and the bowl was super fresh and delicious! I will absolutely return when I'm back in town!,1
been here for a decade now. the Food is greasy and tasty just how I like it. if you want non-greasy Chinese food this is not the place for you.,1
"Found out about this company through reading Yelp reviews. We had a problem with our irrigation not turning on and asked them to come and see if they could come out and help figure out the problem, Ryan, the tech, came the very next day and said it would be a free consultation. He came out as promised on time and it ended up we just had an issue with our plug ins, he helped us get it up and running and he charged nothing for his time and effort A class act in my books! Thank you Ryan!!",1
"I'm new to the area, hadn't found a dr. yet, and picked this office because of its reviews-I'm so glad I did because they're wonderful!  PA David was kind and listened to my concerns while asking questions. The front staff and nurses were very nice and helpful! I highly recommend them!",1
We love this office so much! The staff is amazing! Dr. Hoban is so patient with my 3 kids and the best dentist we've ever been to. We drive from Henderson but it is so worth it!,1
"Perfect doneness of half boiled eggs. To-die-for miso ramen. It was almost better than santouka. Two different styles though. Tonkotsu ramen was great too, but I'm a huge fan of their miso ramen. If we go back to TO, we will definitely stop by again. Try thick noodle for the better texture.",1
"Not only dose this place have good pizza, fried mushrooms, wings etc. but they have such good customer service, for example they gave us 9 ranches instead of 4 like we asked (which we realized that we actually needed) I highly recommend going to this place.",1
"Holy Chihuahuas!I've been in Filet Mignon heaven. The service?  Impeccable.The sides? Everything was wonderful. Tender. Fresh. The bathroom?  Clean, fresh smelling and no water drops on the mirror!We had Filet Mignon, squash soup, asparagus, potatoes, lovely fresh salad.  To celebrate our special occasion we were given a chocolate rich cake concoction with vanilla ice cream.  We also ordered the creme brulee - nice and creamy,  no sandy texture or plastic aftertaste -- crisp on top - not soggy!  It was pricey  - but that was expected  -- and it was worth every penny!  Here is what gave the push to 5 stars from me.  Hardly anyone knows how to make a filet well done without giving  a disclaimer, then burning it to crisp, or keeping it pink/red inside.  It is a true and skillfull chef who is able to cook a filet well done without having to excuse it by adding a disclaimer or begging the patrons to have it be butterflied.Will go there again. And again. And again.* I just want to add that I was not allowed to each chocolate cake (I'm a dog, after all ) but those with me did - and they enjoyed!*",1
I have been there a couple of times and each time I have been there the food is superb. So delicious. I will definitely recommend this place.,1
So sad to see them gone. I was in shock when I stopped by this morning. My daughter and would stop by for some breakfast after dropping her brother at school. Now we need to find a new place :(,1
"On our most recent trip to Phoenix, we set of goal of eating at a new BBQ place every day.  We avoided our regular haunt (Rudy's) and selected the new places from the best of Yelp and recommendations of local friends.  We found some winners and some losers, but Texas BBQ was by far the best of the bunch.I had the Po' Boy special, which was a sausage topped with brisket and pulled pork, nearly a pound of meat.  All three meats were top notch, but the brisket was significantly better than most places.My wife decided to go with the turkey breast and the creamed corn.  The breast was very moist with a nice smoke ring.  She also really liked their sauces, but her favorite of all was the creamed corn.  They make it from scratch, and it has a bit of Jalapeno for flavor.  I've never had a creamed corn that quite matched it.The owner was very friendly and helpful, and allowed us to sample several other meats.  His young son was clearing tables, and was very polite and fun to chat with about the pit and the business.",1
"Had my first gel manicure done today by Vicky! Tons of colors to choose from!! Vicky was super sweet, fun to talk to, and did a wonderful job on my nails. I also received a pedicure and my feet feel fabulous! Already booked my next appointment!",1
"I'm glad that i stopped here and tried a different spin on chicken and waffles. I had the holy chicken sandwich with waffle fries and a strawberry lemonade. It was so good and left me full practically the entire day. I liked the mix of flavors between the maple glazed fried chicken, sriracha sauce, bacon, and egg. Dip it in some waffle syrup and you get this tasty sweet and salty mix with a little kick from the sriracha. I originally thought the waffle would be more fluffy and that the sandwich would break apart immediately as soon as I bit into it. It held together great and it's likely because of the waffle was a little crunchy on the outside and thinner than i'd expected. Overall the service was great, food was yummy, and you know it's not a bad choice when the line is out the door. Definitely a must eat if you're a fan of chicken and waffles.",1
"In my humble opinion, Smoke is one of the best places to get BBQ in Pittsburgh. It just happens that their delicious meat tends to come in tacos, but this is not a traditional taco place. Also, their new menu has a stronger focus on standard BBQ fare (ribs, etc.) while still offering 5 or so flagship tacos.My favorite tacos are the brisket (so, so good -- worth every penny of the price, in my opinion) and the pulled pork. I love that habanero sauce that they put on the pork taco.  It's a great sauce to ask for on the side if you get their mac and cheese, too. I tend not to love m&c because it tends to be bland, fatty, and uninspired feeling. Smoke makes one of the few m&c's in the city that I actually like -- it's super garlicky and flavorful (sharp cheeses) with just the right mixture of textures.On Tuesdays, they do not serve their normal menu; instead, they do burgers only!  I really think that they make the best (basic) burger I've had in Pittsburgh.  Good beef, nice and smoky flavor, and that BUN is to die for.  It comes out so warm, so soft, it's probably the best burger bun I've had in recent memory.The agua fresca is really great for summer, and it seems like you can get it with gin or tequila. The gin cucumber agua fresca is my new favorite drink for the hot months of summer. It is so refreshing!Be mindful that this place can get quite busy during peak hours, but its popularity is well deserved!!",1
"I found this place on yelp today and thought I'd give it a try. I was just looking to get a nice gel manicure. The staff was very friendly and the salon was very clean. They had a HUGE selection of gel colors to choose from. Also, they open a brand new package of nail utensils for each customer. I will definitely be back! I'm excited to start getting my nails done more often:)(PS-I wrote this review on my husband's acct)",1
I was so nervous.  Hannah was so incredible!  She was fun and made us feel comfortable.  We laughed and cheered each other on.  I walked away with a whole routine!  So fun.  Highly recommend!!,1
Great burgers here and atmosphere. Staff extremely friendly. Had to pay 9 dollars for parking at the Aria for 2 hours but in the end it was all worth it! My 14 year old boy was in heaven with his bacon cheeseburger with potato chips along with the fries and cookies and cream milkshake!!! We will be back to have more memorable eats as a family in the near future.,1
Amazing always! Ask for Christin she is always so sweet and keeps the drinks coming. Please try this place you won't be sorry. Make sure she waits on you and tip her well!,1
"The staff at Desert Dental are the consummate professionals. Having had my teeth cleaned yesterday, those I met today had to shield their eyes from the brightness of my smile. A warm thank you to all the staff for making the cleaning process easy and fast. Marleny, the Dental Hygienist, was just as gentle as she promised.",1
"I just got my hair done last night by B. I read a lot of reviews on the place before going so I had heard about average hair cuts, rude employees and whatever else. These reviews made me nervous, but I went in for my appointment and I was relieved when I left because I didn't have any issues with the facility or the employees. I was going in to cover all the regrowth I had from a botched bleaching with a solid all- over colour. When I first arrived, my boyfriend and I were offered drinks, and I had the option to put my belongings in a locker. I then had my consultation with B and we talked about what I wanted to do and she gave me the whole run down of the process I would get that day, as well as when I would most likely need to go back for touch ups. She also consulted the owner who came over and gave some quick tips and advice. Both individuals were very friendly. There was a bit of a wait to get started because the salon was busy, but I was offered drinks and magazines so I'm not bothered about that. B was pleasant to talk to. The other employees would offer to help every once in a while. It was a nice experience in terms of the contact I had with everyone in there. The facility is very modern, clean and comfortable as well. So for anyone who also read the negative reviews and is getting nervous.. Just know that I didn't see any of that and I'm very happy with the colour and cut I received.",1
"I'm always greeted with a smile and by my first name too! It's in the middle of skysong so the lunch rush is heavy but so worth the wait for their sandwiches!Try the ""Liberty Bell"" today then try the ""California Dream"" tomorrow, you won't be disappointed!",1
Get there early because when they run out they are done for the day.  Brisket was good as well as the turkey.  Real Texas style BBQ.  Sauces on the table are good but not really needed.  Sides were plentiful. We probably had a 25 minute wait on Saturday which wasnt too bad.,1
"I loved how everyone was so friendly and I found some really good deals that you cannot find most of the time on ebay, craigslist etc. If you come here with $50 you can potentially walk out with a lot of stuff! Giant print screen blankets for $19, nail polishes and hair accessories for $1, lots of beautiful jewelry and food.Bre's bakery makes a delicious red velvet cupcake! There are tons of cheap toys for your little one and let's not forget clothes and fireworks! Only open on FRI, SAT, and SUN 10am-6pm.",1
"We decided to dine at Bardo with a couple visiting from LA and were hoping to show our foodie friends  a culinary good time here in CLT.   Cocktails, wine, food, and service were all top of the chart.   I won't get into details of each dish (we shared 8, I think, and had to order more of the beef tartare and crudo), but each was exquisite.   Whatever the opposite of heavy handed, this food represents.  Crafted.  Delicate.  Precise.  Fresh.  Flavor bombs, each bite of everything.   And any complaints about portion sizes are silly...look at the prices.  This is a menu set up as your own personal tasting experience...order 5-6 dishes with your partner and you'll have had plenty to eat and have spent no more than at any other fine dining joint in town. Bravo, best food we've had in Charlotte in awhile...been eating in this town 20 years.",1
Always great! Now has a patio :-) special today is kangaroo stuffed cabbage served with sautéed vegetables and cucumber mint yogurt!,1
"Yes yes yes!!!! Newer place on state street that is inconspicuous without too many big flashy signs outside. Inside is not flashy or showy either, but I'm here for the food.You fill out a card and can choose between a sushi burrito or a poke bowl. The portions for poke are SO generous for the great price point. There is fresh fish and seafood and a bunch of different fresh toppings and sauces. So many great options and you can't really go wrong. Tried two medium bowls with brown and sushi rice (SO filling), salmon, ahi tuna, and white tuna as well as an abundance of up to seven toppings (!!) per bowl. Everything was incredibly fresh and delicious and the price point was great compared to the other businesses around that sell the same thing. I wish this business all the best and hope them the best. This will definitely be my go-to.",1
Decent gas prices and very friendly people working there. Employers and owner always go out of their way to be helpful and nice. That goes a long way with me.,1
This is the second time that I have used happy paws I have to say... Vera is always on time if not a little bit early which is perfect very affordable my dog looks amazing I would recommend her to anybody who is looking for mobile grooming it's awesome thank you for such great service and taking care of my dog..He looks amazing,1
"My first visit to this DD location. What a pleasant, happy, clean, relaxing place with the friendliest efficient staff. I only wish I lived or worked closer to this location. It beats all the others I have been to.  Thanks for starting my day with a SMILE. Delicious Donuts and coffee.",1
"My business used to be located within walking distance to Chiwas and not a day goes by that I don't miss them. My absolute favorite menu item is their award winning beans, which I believe has made this place a destination spot. Another must-try is the rajas gordita. No other description besides I'm sorry you haven't already tried it. Chiwas' Instagram account is always updated which is important for me as a customer. Service is genuine and kind and the owners are super cool. 5 stars isn't enough!",1
"So glad I followed Yelp. Took in my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 to get the screen repaired. Very satisfied with the quick care and great customer service. Quality work, I am very satisfied and will be back for sure.",1
"AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!!!I only found this treasure of a business because I was so angry at Lexus of Henderson and their Service Department this morning, that I searched the internet for a reputable Lexus / foreign service repair shop. I was super lucky to see the ""Yelp"" reviews and they all pointed to TRUSTED IMPORTS and spoke highly about this one guy named Andrew. The review of the person who drove from LA to go here is what really drove me to call. So this morning I called and to my surprise spoke with Andrew! Very polite, very confident and very knowledgeable and the last thing I can tell you is his prices BLEW the dealer pricing away, hands down!! I was hoping he could see me and of course he could....just call before you come he said. Well, I got there and like any fantastic business he was slammed and stated I should have called, I did call and left a message - He apologized and stated ""So busy that I couldn't check my messages"". After about 15 minutes of waiting, Andrew invited me in and brought me into his shop (Andrew is the owner) and showed me under the car and pointed out all the ""Fixes"" the dealer stated I needed per their paperwork and flat out told me to enjoy my car and bring it back in 5000 miles when my 2009 Lexus ES 350 turns 92,000 miles. Thank you, Andrew!!!! You just saved me $4,974.39 Andrew just gained a very loyal future customer. Now that's as honest as they come.",1
"Dr. Jenista is fantastic. He is clear and concise with his dental plans and a perfectionist with all of his work. More importantly, he has a wonderful support staff working with him. Kim, one of the hygienists, does everything she can to make you feel comfortable and at ease in the chair. For example, the other day when I was getting my teeth cleaned she noticed I was shivering. Instead of ignoring it, she brought over a soft blanket and covered me! It's little things like that that make a dreaded trip to the dentist that much more enjoyable. Other positive: I've never waited longer than 5 minutes in the waiting room. Big plus for a busy woman!",1
Rich is a great worker. He was serving us and did an excellent job. Very happy with his service.,1
"First rate!Our nephew, who lived in Chicago, was in town. He suggested Lou Malnati's.  We also had heard about Lou Malnati's deep dish from a midwestern friend, but he was SO enthusiastic about their deep dish pizza, we were skeptical.  We were wrong. Our nephew and friend were right: this is the real deal!  Four of us had a Malnati's Chicago Classic and a Malnati Salad (family size).  We had plenty of food -- even had one slice of pizza and some salad left over. Reheated the pizza and enjoyed that today. Skepticism gone.  Lou's really is as good as its reputation.  We'll be regulars from now on.",1
"This review is for the salon - specifically for the stylist, Chrystal.I cannot stress enough how happy I am with the cut she has given me. I first visited her in August, and went back in October for a trim and touch up. The medium length bob with layers cut  that Chrystal gave me has been very complimentary to my curls, yet also allows me to easily blow out into a smooth style. (Until now, I rarely wore my hear in it's natural curl style because it looked too wild and frizzy).Nearly every day for the past few months, someone compliments my hair - whether I let it air dry with my natural curl, or if I blow it smooth. This salon in Silverado Ranch is always friendly and accommodating, and it's worth the drive for me, even though I have another Ulta location closer to my home.",1
"This is the only theater I go to and everyone I bring loves it. I love the fact they sell alcohol and their supreme nachos with chicken are amazing! Their popcorn mix with Carmel,kettle, and cheese popcorn is heaven. I always find the staff super nice.",1
"I never wanted my burger to end. And I'm not even a huge burger fan. I had The Grind and Shine and the chips and egg combo was delicious.Went with a group and each had a different kind - another standout was the only vegetarian option on the menu, the Animal Feed burger. It's fast food, but not like any other. With fresh meat ground each day, the parties are juicy and flavourful. Perfect Friday lunch.",1
Came to this restaurant on May 23rd for dinner to celebrate a birthday with my partner and we were both greatly impressed with the quality and taste of all the dishes we ordered. I found it better than most of the Spanish restaurants I visited while in Spain a few years ago.What a treat!,1
"Absinthe was awesome. After seeing a billboard and looking into it, I swayed my family to buy tickets for that night's showing. Great idea.At times my side hurt from laughing so much and at times my jaw was dropping from the great performances. Adult humor. Intimate setting. Raunchy comedy. Great acrobats.Just go see it.",1
"I went in without an appointment and they were able to fit me in within 15 minutes. I forget now the name of my technician but she was super easy to talk with, it wasn't the awkward empty silence while she holds your hands type of thing. I got a gel manicure about a month ago and its still going strong. No chips or cracks. This is unlike any manicure I've ever had before. This is a super cool area as well so you could hang out after your manicure. Highly, HIGHLY recommend!",1
Monroe's has got to the be the best chicken in town. The customer service is amazing. The wait time is minimal even during lunch hour. The chicken is seasoned to perfection. I love spicy foods and the HOT is right!,1
I am really impressed by the lunch menu. The hibachi steak and scallop combo was delightful! I hate when hibachi places load the food with soy sauce and crappy fillers (like sugar carrots). This place had just the right amount of salt and even added fresh garlic when I asked. Great fries rice and delicious proteins. Great pricing on the sushi too!! Very nice. Definitely will come back.,1
"Jersey mikes is always a must try. From them slicing the meats and cheeses in front of you, to ordering it mikes way it is amazing. I love the Italian meats on the suber sub, and I actually order everything on my sandwich. I recommend eating there though, due to the oils/vinegar it gets very wet if you take it home. I love these subs, cheap and convenient",1
"Great decor, great service, GREAT FOOD. Best dining experience I've had in Vegas. Be warned though, dishes are served Tapas style, in threes... Can result in awkward glances when it's a dinner for two...",1
Melissa is hands down the best. She has a great attitude and doesnt mind explaining things if you have any questions. She makes you feel comfortable and doesn't rush! I will be going back soon,1
"Kung Fu Tea, welcome to Cleveland. Cleveland, welcome to legit boba. I'll be back...",1
"There are lots of places to get an ice cream fix around Cleveland, but Mitchell's is the next! This location is the mother ship, and where they make the frozen greatness. Don't let the line make you hesitate, it always moves quickly!",1
Great crust- Bakers pride oven- good cheese- just right- lunch specials by the slice- delicious! This may be my favorite yet!,1
"Roasted tomatillo enchilada chicken, with two different cheeses on there Wrapped in corn tortillas and baked to perfection, and of course it was so good I had it eat it with a spoon.My son approved this meal by giving me some resting baby face.This restaurant is 100% legit, the service is on point and very cordial. More than that the vibes were out of this world. If you're looking to change up the way you chow down on enchiladas then this is the place.Right hand on the Bible, left hand with a spoonful of enchiladas in my mouth this place is the truth.",1
The new McDonalds is much improved over the old one at the same site.  The drive thru now has two ordering lanes.  This really helps out during rush times.  The whole parking/traffic situation has been addressed and getting in and out is much easier.  This was an issue at the old location.,1
"I am a MGM MLIFE Gold member. Stayed at the Mirage many times, this is always a good , comfortable stay in a location that is second to none.Checked in at the MLIFE Priority Desk on 3-12-17 at about 7:15pm with a lady with short hair cut. First, she should not be handling Priority Check-in as she needs more training, the only thing she will do is turn loyal MLIFE Customer to ex-customers. She decided that there is no way she can get my wife and I a King Bed on a Sunday night. Not acceptable.Went to the room assigned with 2 queen Beds, called Front Desk and a manager name Ricky Reyes came on. He was super courteous, friendly and helpful. He apologized and told me he will do his best to find me something. He came back from a short hold and got us a room with a King Bed.Ricky's service is what I have expected from this excellent Hotel since we first stayed here when I opened in 1989!Please give this man a promotion asap! And take that lady off the Priority desk!",1
"Great story- all true!! I had been going to this AAMCO for a couple months for my Suburban and was as sure as I could be that they weren't taking advantage of me, but then when my Suburban started showing some new symptoms I took it back. They diagnosed it, told me $1000 will fix it then when they got into the problem further, they realized they were mistaken. I got a call from Michael saying to come get it and take it back to the last place I got that problem fixed (differential) and they will fix it for free. He was right!!! I never ever ever ever would have known the difference. I got it fixed for $0. I was really shocked and now am completely sure that Michael always has my best interest at heart. I'm a lifer now. Thanks for the peace of mind!!",1
"We loved this place! We went early on a Tuesday evening and were spoiled with attention (judging by our waiter's enthusiasm, I would guess he was an owner or manager). We started with two $5 happy hour appetizers (can't remember what they call the beef dumplings? And then the other app was the eggplant dip). Both were great, but I really enjoyed the eggplant dip. Beers (very large ones) also had great happy hour prices.Our waiter recommended two kabob platters for first timers to share - one with spinach rice and the ground chicken and ground beef kabobs (again, can't remember the official name), the other with kabuli rice and regular chicken and beef kabobs. Everything we tried was very flavorful and delicious, we will be back!.",1
I've been coming here since the new ownership took over and I am always 100% happy with their work! Julie and Ivy always take such good care of me! As long as they are here in Vegas I will always go to them! I'd recommend this place to anyone!,1
"I love Mike and Wendi. They are reliable, compassionate, and caring. They have taken extremely good care of my dog Lily for years. They tend to any needs your dog and your house might have and are always happy to help. They are familiar faces around the area who will always say hello and ask about your pet. Overtime, they have been not only awesome pet sitters, but also amazing friends.",1
"Patisserie with a twist! They have poke bowls- which are awesome, by the way! A pleasant surprise cuz that's something you wouldn't expect from a place called Paris Baguette. It's very Parisian with all their pastries and coffee but then they have a spread of poke bar on the side.. very good, I must say! And it's right at st marks square so you get that Venetian view at a Parisian patisserie eating a Japanese poke bowl. Lol",1
Been here about 4 times everything is excellent the cookies are to die for the Oreo chocolate chip cookie especially instead of chocolate chips they use Oreos inside. Cupcakes are excellent too. Staff is very friendly. And last Saturday I ordered my dad a cake for his bday it was ready and perfect prompt Monday morning price was very reasonable. You all should check it out you won't be disappointed.,1
Great prices on mattresses and sectionals - I was even given free delivery.  The salesperson was very patient and showed us many different options.,1
"I rarely submit yelp reviews. However, I feel that this company offers exceptional service, relatively reasonable prices, as well as good customer service. I was very satisfied with this company and RJ was a great help to me. I was very satisfied with my customer service experience. if you require your iPhone to be repaired, they offer included lifetime warranty on parts and services. Great business!",1
"I love coming here. The staff is friendly and the patio is nice in the summer. They accommodate dietary restrictions which is great. My favorite items on the menu are the avocado tofu wrap and the buenos dias wrap. They are so yummy, I cannot believe it. Very healthy too. They had a Morrocan stew as a special of the day. I just had to have it and I was glad I did. It was so tasty. I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you want something healthy and delicious.",1
"This was my second trip to the Canyon and with Awesome Anthony as our guide, it was even better than the first. Anthony, a lifelong resident of Las Vegas was entertaining and informative on the two hour trip, and kept a positive attitude despite the failure of a couple of the others in the group to arrive back to the bus at the specified time. He welcomed questions and happily answered them, including mine about good local restaurants (and he was right about all of them).Unlike the other company, Sweetours offered unlimited cold water and a bagged breakfast - it was simple but perfectly fine.",1
Great food for a great price! I would recommend the Vegas Roll. The workers were very kind and helpful.,1
Loved the Filet Mignon Nachos and Cadillac Margarita! Cool bartenders and fun atmosphere too.,1
OMG the best pace ever its Disneyland in my mouth can't wait for them to come to Atlanta,1
"A Solon Institution. As you open the door, you enter a time warp, taken back to the 1950's.  Best breakfast in town, with your order shouted to the chef right from your table.  Where the real business of Solon happens over coffee and eggs...",1
"We hadn't been to the Postino on Central in quite some time, so decided to pop in and take advantage of the amazing $5 happy hour wine...love both the rose and sparkling rose!  We also indulged in a bruschetta board - brie & apple with fig jam, proscuitto with figs and marscapone, sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese and salami with pesto...they were all delicious!  This place gets crazy busy, so pick your time to visit wisely.",1
"I was having a case of the Hump Day Blues....tired from Iruna and the Rusty Spur the night before and a long stressful day at work, all I wanted to do was go home... Until I saw it...a light brighter than no other coming from the Wednesday evening Phoenix Public Market. Usually it's Short Leash that shines with such intensity, but this evening it was TORCHED GOODNESS and their selection of Creme Brulee. My saving grace...AND they accept credit cards! [my cash-less a$$ be saved] *bells of heaven chiming in the distance* The selection seemed endless from vanilla, chocolate, peanut butter, lemon, lavender, maple....oh I can't remember them all.... I decided on 2 (yes 2 chastise me later for my indulgence) ...Lemon and Lavender....wishing I had gone for the maple topped with the optional caramelized bacon, which he said he only had 3 left of those. But I made no mistake with my choices. They both were very subtle but distinct in their individual flavors. The quality of the ingredients did shine through. I am going to have to start stalking them on twitter and facebook....",1
"Ok, these people are EXACTLY what you need at your next event.  They show up on time, they come prepared with two people to put the photo booth together and manage the prints.  Then when your event is finished they pack it all back up and are out the door.  Their images are so clear, they really give your event a cohesive feel.  Just perfect for our Halloween party!!  Thanks so much Marcus - we will definitely have you back!!",1
"Two nights ago I visited this hospital with my two beautiful babies. The time had come for them to cross the unavoidable rainbow bridge. Without the care, sympathy, and love of these living angels, I don't believe I could have gotten through it. Sophia is a gift that was sent to me that night. She cried with me, walked me through the steps, and held me as I sobbed. I could go on and on but I wanted to write this review, through the tears, for two reasons: for the public to know that this is an amazingly caring facility; and for the staff to know how much I truly appreciate what they do day in and day out. Thank you so much for allowing me to give my dogs the dignity and grace that all living beings deserve. You are a true blessing.Brenda Narveson Forever Mommy of Rusty & Riley",1
"This was such an amazing experience. I called last minute because my work called me out and they were nice enough to squeeze me in. I've been waxing for almost 6 years consistently and have tried every where from lunchbox, European wax center, to the salon down the street. This place, hands down, is the best. I could've taken a nap for gods sake. It was literally as close to painless as you can get for ripping your hair out by the roots. The girl I had was amazing as well. Super friendly and made it seem like I was having coffee with a friend and not getting my who-ha waxed. Nice, clean and friendly. Definitely coming back!!",1
"While in Vegas we did the usual stuff and things I like to do. My go-to places. Places I like to eat and places I like to visit. During our most recent stay we checked out The Mob Museum! During our visit (Thursday, March 01, 2018) to The Mob Museum we did the All Access Pass... which included the Crime Lab Experience... and the Use Of Force Training Experience. I pointed out the LEO in our group and told the role players to give him the more challenging scenarios... hahaA must-see while in Las Vegas!",1
"Came here for a beer... Found love with the zingers. Much like my marriage I thought I knew what I was getting into but a few years or beers later I found myself yearning for more chicken... Or something, idk. The place is good. The Cajun linguine was legit. #cheers",1
"We have used them to replace a couple of broken springs and then we had them fit 3 new garage doors. They give no-nonsense quotes over the phone. They are great value, they are prompt and they do a clean job. We would recommend them without any reservation.",1
Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant! The food was fabulous and the service was unbelievable. K D our server was a cutie! We loved every single thing about this restaurant and hated to leave! The medicine man pho was fantastic! The chicken was seasoned perfectly. We will definitely be back SOON!!! We will recommend this restaurant to our friends.,1
I come here all the time for the lunch special 2 slices and a drink for $3.99 this is the best pizza on my side of town.,1
"Most of these stars are weighted heavily on the best piece of meat I've ever had in my life, Nobu's A5 Wagyu on the rocks. I've always heard people rave about this place, even Drake, but I finally get it now. 1000% legit!Yes, you're paying for a lavish experience. It will be ridiculously expensive, but like I said, the steak is life-altering. Our bill for 2 was around $1000 with tip. That was for approximately 11 drinks (I know, excessive. lol), the jalapeño yellowtail, chicken skewers, hella rice, a couple sushi rolls, a wonderful tenderloin, 6oz. of A5 Wagyu, and the half coconut haupia. No leftovers to take home.To be completely honest, I was a little underwhelmed by the restaurant itself. Yes, it's a pretty space, but I'm sure there could be a little extra flair to look at while you dine for the price. A baby shark aquarium; something. lol We ended up being nestled between 2 couples in a very tight European style row of tables. A little more privacy woulda been great.Aside from that, service was good, and I'll be back when I can celebrate being rich enough to dine here regularly.",1
"I always come here for my Thai food. Food quality is consistent every time I order (Manchurian chicken chow mein) The pad sew was very good as well. I would give it a 4.5 star, because although the prices are on the moderate but modestly priced. The portions are very good. The service is always on par, friendly and prompt. Stars of Thai is a gem in the rough nestled off the ever popular highway 7 and woodbine.",1
"Adventure Pet Resort clearly cares about your pets. This place allows our German Shepherd to run around and interact with other dogs, while also having staff keep a close eye on her. They have monthly slumber parties that are a great deal and our dog always comes back happy and more importantly tired! We will always recommend this to other fur parents.",1
I love this place! Its best to come at lunch time to avoid the crazy dinner wait. Some times the wait for dinner can be as long as 2 hours but they are open untill 2am!!!Sushi is great and the rolls are awesome. My two favorites are OID and Yebisu.  This is always one of my first stops when I arrive in Las Vegas.,1
"I have been working with Level 9 Studios for about 5 years now. I met him at an event and really liked the work he did. His turn around time for his photography was amazing and his video clips were very well done. Event after event, Scott has been my go to person. He truly goes the extra mile to make sure his clients are satisfied.From video editing/production to various events including birthdays, bridal showers, baby showers, etc. he can do it all! He is the most humble person to work with and very easy to get along with. I definitely would recommend him, very honest, fast turn around time not to mention punctual!",1
"First time here! Met a friend for happy hour. Absolutely no complaints. I had a Jalapeño margarita and a passion fruit margarita. Both were delicious. I wish I would have been told they offered different salts for the rim. I didn't know until after I ordered and saw it in the menu. The waiter was very nice and available when we needed him. My friend and I spilt the guacamole as an appetizer. It's a very hearty portion for 2 people. We each ordered 3 tacos. I ordered the shrimp one, mushroom one, and carne asada one. The shrimp one hands down was the best to me. Since we were there at happy hour and taco Tuesday our final bill was very reasonable. I will definitely return!",1
GRAND SLAM!Another great place for this picky New YAWKER to go to for off the hook great AUTHENTIC Italian food.My ONLY complaint isYou're too far from us.BUT worth the drive.Best of luck!,1
"I go to this place specifically for Landon, who's been giving me amazing haircuts for several months now. Landon is awesome with fades/tapering, buzzer work, scissor work, and basic styling too. But most importantly, he is consistent--great cuts every single time! I've tried places all over Henderson and the Southern Vegas area in the past, and now I'll never get my haircut from anyone other than Landon. Seriously, he's that good! You can always walk in, but I find setting up an appointment is best to guarantee a good time slot.",1
"Great experience & super friendly/helpful staff!I chose this as a weekend activity mainly for the boys in our group, but it was actually fun for all!They let you bring in your own food, and have picnic style tables for you to relax & enjoy. Make sure to wear closed toed shoes--happy I had a pair in the car.Great activity, check it out!",1
It was our first time here. They did an excellent job on mine and my sisters pedis. They were so friendly and the shop was nice and clean. I will definitely go back to them.,1
"Have gone to BoSa ever since I was a kid, seems like every time it's gets better! 100% recommend to anyone looking for a consistent, cheap, delicious donut shop!",1
"Had a late lunch here this past week. Just down the street from the Pittsburgh Renaissance Hotel where I was staying.Got a table for one. Looked over the menu and decided on the wood fired meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy, and asparagus. Plus water.They serve your water in these cool little old fashioned style milk bottles (see attached pix). They pour some water for you into your glass and then leave you with extra water in the bottle - I loved this touch!The place was really hopping when I arrived - very busy! Took about 15 minutes for my food to come up.When the dish arrived (see attached pix), it was a very nice presentation of a basic meat and potatoes meal. I tasted the meatloaf first - it was absolutely delish and amazing! It had a wonderful richness and savory aspect to it - and yet was not heavy - in fact it had a lightness to it. In stark contrast to the really *heavy* dense meatloaf I had at the Landmark Diner in Atlanta earlier in the week.The gravy and mashed potatoes were also very good. The Asparagus tasted like it was lightly steamed.Service was good and I really like this restaurant. There is a second level upstairs which I did not see - and apparently a roof deck area that is some times open in the evenings for the enjoyment of beverages.",1
"Excellent food, modern (somewhat casual for a steakhouse) atmosphere, excellent service. They serve a trio of fries instead of bread when you first sit down. Two of them are good, but the truffle fries with truffle aioli is amazing. Wedge salad was good but nothing special. Beet and burratta salad was delicious (very soft, delicate mozzarella). Fillet was simple, but perfect. Mac and cheese with truffle oil is amazing, but very filling. Artichoke hearts with goat cheese is good, but nothing special compared to the mac and cheese. The asparagus was good, but falls in third place for the sides (behind the artichoke and goat cheese). Save room and get the beignets with creme brule to finish things off.",1
"My granddaughter was one of the first children enrolled in Kaleidoscope. I know my daughter was a bit nervous as was I since there was really no way other than gut instinct to know whether this would be a good fit or not. Well, come to find out, there is no way any school or any group of administrators could be better than the ones at this school. Kaylee started there at three years old and continued until she turned five and started kindergarten. Half way through the last year, her parents work schedule changed. Robin and Heather then began helping with transportation so that Kaylee didn't have to switch schools mid year. From day one, Kaylee was learning numbers, letters, simple math and spelling. And songs. I loved to hear her sing all the songs they learned. I loved the diversity of the children. I loved how much she loved going, even missing school during the holidays. My kids and granddaughter were always treated like family at Kaleidoscope, never just a number. Robin knew the parents of each child on a first name basis. The classrooms are small enough that every child gets lots of one on one time. Much of the learning is hands on. Most of all, though, you can't ""fake"" liking kids. It just shows. And the people at this school LOVE children. And they love teaching. My granddaughter could not have started at a better school with a more loving staff. Robin and Heather, you set the bar high enough, I don't know if any other learning experience for Kaylee will meet the standards you set. I thank you both from the bottom of my heart.",1
"Enjoyable atmosphere, great ice cream and other items.  Service was super fantastic!  Visited twice on my most recent trip to Scottsdale.",1
I am not much familiar with all terminals but Terminal 3 with pre clearance for US travels is still under renovation. But they have great seating with iPad for every seat. You can order food to be delivered at you seat @ Nobel burgers. It also has few fun games to earn some rewards and use for buying food..,1
"Definitely my favourite steakhouse in the city. Waiter was super knowledgable about the items and gave us amazing recommendations. Fantastic place to come for special events. However, it can get pricey depending on what you order.",1
Phenomenal service.  Sam is the best waiter ever!!!  First visit of many to come.  Perfect atmosphere for a romantic dinner and outstanding meal.  Cannot wait to return and share with friends.,1
"If you know me well, you know that I absolutely LOVE tacos (I mean...who doesn't?!) Joyride satisfies every facet of my love for tacos by serving up a variety of delicious gourmet tacos.I ended up at Joyride by the recommendation of my mom and we decided to go as a family for my birthday. I thoroughly enjoyed my birthday experience. First, of all the staff was so friendly and accommodating. We had multiple servers come through to make sure we had everything we needed throughout the night. I started the night off by ordering their Prickly Pear Margherita. It was pink and sweet with the right amount of tequila and adorned with a cute little umbrella. My boyfriend got the Pineapple Mojito which was equally tasty! Next I ordered the Mexican Street Corn appetizer. It comes on the cob with a knife to shed the kernels on your own. It was so creamy and the kernels burst with savory paprika flavor. I'm not quite sure what is in their sauce on the corn that they deem""white magic"" but it could possibly be pixie dust filled with rainbows that make your eyes sparkle once digested. For the main entree, I ordered the three tacos that come with your choice of a side. I went with the Carne Asada, Braised Beef, and Crispy Fish with a side of the Bomb Black Beans (great name, I love some alliteration). They all had multitudes of flavor, making each taco unique. However, my favorite was the Braised Beef. It has avocado which is always important but those gastrique onions really make the taco pop; they complemented the seasoned Braised Beef perfectly. The Bomb Black Beans speak for themselves with their name! My boyfriend also did the 3 tacos, my dad got a burrito, and my mom has two tacos. All plates were completely cleared by the end of the meal. At the end, because it was my birthday, they brought out their Better than Betty's dessert on the house (so nice!!). I love a brownie with some ice cream and carmel sauce!! YUM. The restaurant aesthetics are wonderful, great vibe, modern fun decor, and plenty of seating. Reservations are never a bad idea on the weekend as it gets very busy. Valet Parking is complimentary but it's always nice to leave a tip! Otherwise, the parking situation can be tough! I will be heading back soon to try more tacos!!",1
"Husband was at a conference and I needed lunch.  Surprisingly, one of the best for crab cakes!!  Staff extremely kind and helpful. Highly recommended!",1
Just used these guys for my oil change. They called before and showed up at my home on time. The service only took about 20 minutes. The mechanic was very professional and helpful. The price isn't bad either. I would definitely recommend them to anyone. I will be using them for all of my oil changes.,1
I love this place! Lermin is a wonderful host! The food is amazing and by far one of the best places to eat for breakfast and lunch in Las Vegas. A hidden gem. Try the Pork Chili Verde...incredible!,1
We were in from Florida and came to Planet 13 it was amazing!! Kelsey was extremely helpful and gave us some great recommendations! If you're in the area definitely come check it out.,1
"This place is AMAZING!It's brand new and clean, fantastic service, and most importantly... DELICIOUS!I can't wait to go back and try everything else they have to offer. So far, I can't get enough of the brownies and the cupcakes. If anything else is half as good as those, you're in for a treat!",1
"I want to take the time to recognize Jason Frazier from the service department. He is truly exceptional! I have recently purchased my FIRST vehicle from Carmax. Initially, I admittedly was hesitant to buy ANYTHING from Carmax. I always had the impression the quality of vehicles and service is not great. But I sure was wrong! I have owned and had service done from many high end dealerships throughout the years (Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, Aston Martin, Lexus, BMW, etc). None compare to the service Jason has provided me today. I am truly impressed. I now plan to purchase every future vehicle from Carmax! Carmax management, if you are reading this... PROMOTE PROMOTE PROMOTE!!!",1
Amazing flat white for a great price (4$) & the avocado toast was one of the best I ever had!,1
"We were served Andhra dosa which had spinach paste inside ! We did realise it was not what we wanted as pic of Andhra dosa in their menu looked completely different than what we had been given ! Although they insisted it was still Andhra dosa , we totally knew it was not the rit one and requested it to be taken back ! Next came unexpectedly to us, but we were offered another dosa and were not charged for the andhra one ! Professional and gracious attitude towards their guests ! Food is served with great care and devotion which is what matters the most ! Amazing experience  :)",1
"They have green tea, baked goods and good food, artwork to look at, live music and BEER. Even better, they have specials on said beer! It's also great for people watching and the staff has always been friendly whenever I've been there. It's a great place to go after work and unwind, which I do pretty often.",1
Hidden gem - great food and great service! Recommend pulled pork sandwich and veggie cakes. Large selection of craft beers and drinks,1
"I thought this place was really good! It took awhile to get our pizza and salads but both were really delicious. Nice thin, crispy crust. I already want to go back!",1
"Forget the fireman.Forget the cop.Forget the business man.All I want all night every night is the MILK MAN!! No joke... the milk man was HOT! And it wasn't the bangin' body I was digging, it was his smile (*wink, wink*).I've been to a few male reviews in Vegas and I'd have to say this one is my favorite so far. The guys are super cute and pretty personal! Plus they're all really from down under and have the cute accent! Highlights for me included:* The bar with really stiff drinks and drink specials! * The milk man* The Birthday Girl (my friend) going up on stage* The milk man* The group pictures where we made them do asian poses! and of course* The milk man!",1
Just went here for the first time! Our server Ashley was amazing and so friendly! Treated us like family! Atmosphere is so cute! Everyone wears pjs! The food is delish! Big portions! Can't go wrong with that!,1
"We just ate there again, one thing that has to be found in a good restaurant IMHO is consistency, there is no point in having a place that on one night can serve a great meal and the next night it sucks.Well Rollin Smoke keeps delivering fantastic BBQ, end of story, I cannot recommend this place enough.",1
"Trey was so easy to work with and was able to help us out same day! We look forward to having him monthly, and so far so good - no more summer bugs!",1
"This is a great park that has many seating areas, a big green field to play soccer or baseball on, a splash pad and a big playground. They have clean bathrooms and the park itself is maintained very well. It is hidden in between the streets of Upper Summerlin. The shaded pavilion is first come first serve and you can't leave, someone must stay there to hold the tables. This came from a council person for the park. Either than that, there are seating areas around the park and near the playground and splash pad so you able to keep an eye on your lil ones without being a helicopter parent. They also have BBQ grills which you can use, you are not able to bring your own, no alcohol is allowed and you can have bouncy houses, but check with the council beforehand to verify which types are allowed.",1
"Best Banana Bread Ever! Before I moved to Vegas, every visit consisted of a stop at this joint. Very warm mom and pops feeling at this place and food is delicious. You must have the banana bread! Did I say MUST? I mean ohhh emm geee, iits sooo delicious with some melted butter spread on top. You'll thank me for LIFE.",1
Absolutely love this place. The eye doctor was amazing and too 40 minutes doing my eye exam even with clients waiting. She did both contact  and glasses prescription and I am overly pleased with the reailys and the prices.,1
Love this store it's much cleaner then Walmart but I will say the employees seem to have an attitude most of the time when I come in here that can be annoying thankfully I don't really interact with them to much,1
This place has the best wings in the city! The pizza is bomb! The beer is awesome! The wait staff is always friendly.,1
"This place is great.  First, I love the decor and ambiance.  They blended an old building with newer fixtures in an excellent manner.  Five stars for ambiance.  The servers are helpful and know their stuff.  If you are hungry, food trucks may be parked out front.  There are board games should you get bored.Now for the beers.  I am a IPA fan and the brew did not disappoint.  Their Legendary Weapons (American IPA) was smooth and tasty.  Certified Public Accountant did not disappoint.   Five stars for the beer.  The only negative is that there is not much else around this place.  Do not plan on coming here and then walking to another establishment.   That being said, it is well worth the drive!",1
I contacted Down Under Plumbing last night regarding a leak from my water softener. Rob was able to come first thing this morning. After checking the problem he quickly went to work and repaired the issue. very happy using Down Under Plumbing and I will continue to use them for all of my plumbing needs.,1
"The ""west sider"" sandwich is the BOMB!  Great spot; the girl working the cash register is super hot, and the sandwich chef is a true culinary artist.",1
Replacing 2 watch batteries.  No wait time and took a few minutes.  Can't beat the price and timeliness!,1
"Another fabulous Cirque Show!  O was incredibly visually stimulating.  Unlike Zumanity, the theater is huge...so having a balcony seat may not be the best way to go...tickets are expensive (in comparison to the other Cirque shows) but O is definitely the best Cirque show I have seen.  It's absolutely stunning...you can't look away!",1
"i scored a collector's figurine of mario from the original super mario bros. release back in the 80s at starpop, and troy was super helpful in sorting the ones that are worth collecting and ones that aren't.the gathering of vintage clothes has grown, and tempted me with every penny i had.star pop keeps getting better.",1
"I went into this site in January on a whim to get some space back in my garage. The staff were so friendly and did not pressure us at all so I just went ahead and rented a unit on the spot. I was pleasantly surprized that it took less than 10 minutes to get it all done and signed up.Usually with these places when you move out is the true test, I had to move to Seattle for work suddenly, so came March I had to move out and the service I got was just amazing. Firstly the staff remembered my name and unit number so I did not even have to give that, they found the file in mere seconds and were super helpful with not only getting my movers access to the unit but also went above and beyond and helped me dontate some unwanted goods.Thank you guys for an awesome experience!",1
Went here yesterday for waxing (booked it with Thuy after reading all the great reviews on here). Def. one of the best waxing experiences I've had! Thuy was very knowledgeable as many other yelpers mentioned. Liked how she gave really good tips to avoid ingrown hairs. Asked if I was doing okay and was very friendly.The location is a bit out of the way for me to go to as I live more downtown but well worth the trip! I am def. going to go back at least once more before I go back to Waterloo in Jan. Also might get a shellac manicure done next week since I hear the nail services are just as good.,1
Oh man do I miss Dr. Wilson and Spanish Hills Dental. I was a patient here for over 10 years.  The office staff was always great in providing complete details on pricing and never was there an error. The dental hygienists are all very good and use gentle techniques when conducting cleanings. Dr. Wilson is a very gentle man. He is so nice. He is great dentist.  When he gives novocaine he knows how make it almost painless. I had lots of work done with him. They took such great care of me that when I moved to back to my home town I tried to continue to get up there for dental work and cleanings. It's been 5 years since I moved away from Vegas and I still can't find a dentist as great as his office is.,1
"This place has seriously yummy shaved ice! I am currently 7 months pregnant and have been coming here all winter to satisfy my shaved ice craving that comes about every 3 days LOL! At first, it was just a substitute for my old favorite , the BB word (we wont mention them) but! There are now a few reasons I like this place more: the most important reason being that they are open on Sundays! I get it, family time, but I WANT MY SHAVED ICE ON SUNDAYS! Also, they put a lot more syrup on their shaved ice which is soooo yummy. I also agree that their iced is finer. All in all, it's my new fav :)",1
"First time here this AM, wife loved the cinnamon apple French toast and the Western omelette was a perfect mix and quantity of ingredients.  Often there is too little or too much of one or more of peppers, onion or ham.  If your real hungry get the pancake with it, again terrific.  Service was rock solid.",1
"The pizzas, pastas, bruschetta and spinach artichoke dip are fantastic. Good atmosphere and nice staff. Never had a super long wait to sit down.",1
"Very underrated and under-appreciated spot (as is the Stratosphere in general). Some of the best views in Vegas can be found here, as the lounge is on the 107th floor with panoramic windows. We love getting a cocktail in the afternoon and watching the planes come and go at McCarran. Awesome happy hour from 4pm to 7pm every day -- 1/2 off most appetizers and drinks. The staff are friendly and experts at what they do. Mari waited on us last trip, she was amazing and so sweet. This place is definitely in the regular rotation.",1
Beautiful setting and fab staff with Neehal attending. Very nice selection and Neehal helped so much in my search for the just right men's bag. Have been considering the LV bags for some time and fearful of copies bought anywhere besides the company stores. Thanks Neehal.,1
This restaurant has great quality chinese food with a reasonable price too.  On average about $9 a dish.  The quantity is perfect and we are usually able to finish everything without being too filled.  This place to quite busy on a weekday too.,1
"Just wanted to let everyone know about this Diabetic bakery. I had never been here before and let me tell you I have been missing out on some really great tasting Chocolate Cream Puffs.This place also made our Wedding Cake for me and my wife and it was really great tasting. We ordered a Chocolate cake with Strawberry filling and cream icing. It was very tasteful and both my sister and brother in-law really enjoyed it.I am not a diabetic and I can not tell the difference between the way the desserts taste to regular desserts, if I did not know that the cake or the chocolates or the pastries or the cookies we had from this place, I would have thought they were from a regular bakery.This place would be great for people doing the KETO Diet.This place will ship items to you out of state.All the desserts here are so great tasting and the staff is very nice.",1
"This is a totally awesome man-made beach sandwiched between an office building and a pier.  It was a little cold so we kept our shoes and jackets on during a little bit of sun exposure.  The premises are clean and well-maintained and everything is just incredibly cute!  As a Californian, I've been to plenty of beaches in my life but this one left a lasting impression.",1
Highly recommend! The service and food was amazing! Mariah was an amazing server and added on to the overall experience! We'll definitely be back :),1
"This place is neat! I love the aura and the food was delicious! I ordered the chicken chilequiles. The tomatillo sauce was very good, and the chips had just the right crispness to them. I tried the barbacoa Benedict with hash browns and that was also very tasty!It was busy! Check peak hours before if you don't want to wait.. Overall, we had a great experience and would come back!",1
"My preferred bookstore, they have a very good selection of books on Celtic Paganism. The atmosphere is excellent, staff always helpful, prices are good, and, the place is ACTUALLY organized. You can occasionally find some great finds. Recently I found a old leather bound version of To Kill A Mockingbird for $8. I always tour the discount tables out front featuring some great discounted books. Sometimes if you find a title you like you can dig the stack and find a trade in version, which will save you a bit. There is plenty of parking, but getting a spot close can be challenging on popular days.",1
Super yummy! Seriously we could have eaten here three days in a row. It is a hidden gem.The service was awesome and the owner was a nice guy and came out to talk to us. We had a great time just hanging out here. We mostly just had sushi and it was all great. Outstanding place. A real find and so reasonable! Loved it!,1
"I know it is a very good place to eat when I come into a city and look forward to my meal at a place I had eaten at on previous trips. This is the place. I can never go wrong with baby bok choy, eggplant & garlic and Singapore noodles. No rush, practice with the chopsticks, enjoy the tea. Breathe....",1
"There is a lot of eating in these pasties.  It's super casual, sit where you want, easy-going staff.  There are several different choices whether you're a meat eater or not.  A tip from me to you, if you get chips (fries), ask for a side of HP sauce. It's a better than ketchup.  The location is near Walking Stick, makes for a great choice pre show to avoid the high costs of the food.  The 5th star isn't even for my experience- over heard the server admit a mistake, apologize, and comp the meal. This was without being asked. Great service!",1
My daughters car needed so much work done to it...which would have cost more than the car was worth. I explained to them that I just need the car to have the repairs to make it drivable for short term until I can get her a new vehicle in another state. They went above and beyond to keep the price affordable and make the brakes and belts safe. During the work one of the repairs they originally thought was necessary they determined didn't need to be done. They could have done the unnecessary repair just to make more money but they didn't. Honest and affordable! Greatly appreciated!!!,1
Great customer service!!!  We went after a run and got to try the juices before deciding what to get!!  Will definitely come back :),1
"We recently purchased a used car from Audi North Scottsdale. This was by far the best car buying experience we've ever had -- and we have bought from several other dealers in the Valley. Our experience was characterized by a few simple concepts: fairness, honesty, trust. There was no pressure, there were no games. They said what they would do and they did exactly that, resulting in a perfect buying experience. It's really encouraging to know that there are still great auto dealers out there.",1
The best coffee and teas... and service EVER!!!! Great atmosphere and staff. Definitely my #1 choice - a true gem in the midst of so many Toronto coffee places - and will be a regular customer going forward.,1
"Small place, you'll be sure to wait on the weekend, it's cash only, but still completely worth a visit (or many).  For the price you can't beat the offerings, their crepes are famous for a reason, blueberry stuffed and banana chocolate are standouts, a Pittsburgh landmark that lives up to its reputation.",1
"I wanted to do a tour while in Montreal.  After debating between the brewpub tour or the Mile End food tour, we settled for the food tour in the Mile End.  Jeremy (Jay) was a great tour guide.  He was very funny, but he definitely knew his stuff.  He showed us all sorts of interesting things about the area and how it has changed in the past 20 years, which was a great history lesson in urban planning!We went to 7 stops, with 6 of them having food.  We were stuffed at the end, and we hadn't eaten breakfast that morning.  The food was plentiful, and we even got to try some beer at one of the stops.  The restaurants chosen were delicious and accommodating for the group.Since we were staying the Latin Quarter/Gay Village area, this was not a part of Montreal we would have most likely seen, other than maybe driving by for a bagel at St-Viateur Bagel (and btw those were PHENOMENAL, and my favorite stop on the tour).  It was nice to see a new and up-and-coming part of Montreal.  I definitely recommend this tour.  The price was very reasonable, and it was a lot of fun!",1
"I've been going to Edgar at the Manner for the last 6 months and couldn't be happier.  Ed is an absolutely fantastic barber that I found by viewing his skills on a YouTube video he did a while back.  He's more an artist really (check out his instagram and YouTube videos and see examples of his work yourself).  He takes the time to get your input and do the haircut the right way at a very fair price for the quality of the cut that you get.  Ed gives outstanding haircuts with styles that range from classic, to modern and even cutting edge (pun intended). He also gives the sickest fades in the game which is a speciality of the Manner.  If you want a clean, crisp, perfectly lined up fade and cut then this is the place for you.  Jay and Joe, who work with Ed at the manner, are really great too and both give outstanding fade cuts.  The atmosphere at the Manner is upscale contemporary with a fresh and cool vibe while still maintaining that ""classic"" men's barbershop feel.  You'll find great conversations with the humorous and friendly staff in a great location in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. I've also found the online scheduling system is especially convenient.  You can see who has open appointment day/time slots and pick who you want to see and when.  The system even sends you confirmation email confirmations and text message reminders if you want!  They also do walk-ins if you're more of a spur of the moment type.  If you want a great cut with a clean and crisp fade then the Manner is the place for you.  Check it out and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",1
"Great place to get your vehicle worked on. We especially appreciate Mr. Meyers. He listens, works hard, and understands how important you vehicle is to you.",1
"I wife and I stayed here in March 2018. We weren't really sure what to expect when we pick the hotel online but it turned out to be a great place! The rooms are beautiful, clean, renovated and with great shower! Our room had a balcony where we sat in the afternoons in the sun it was great. The hotel is close to almost anything you'd want to do in phoenix including Spring training baseball, shopping, the old town area which is just a short walk away and the botanic Garden. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Phoenix!",1
"Listen. I'm going to be straight with you.I'm an ice cream fan. Like no self-control kinda fan that blathers about nothing but ice cream when I get something good.The waffle ice cream sandwich here is so flippin' delicious. It's probably the lightest waffle I've ever had with just the right touch of cinnamon and chocolate chips. Fresh made... and slathered with ice cream.It's like the first time I've found something in Las Vegas that I would actually tell tourists to come and get. And I've lived here for nearly 5 years. Seriously, I tell people to go to Tartine in San Francisco, Magnolia Bakery in New York, Hoosier Mama's Pies in Chicago.... and now.... The Lunch Box for the waffle ice cream sandwiches in Las Vegas.Done.",1
"One of my favorite Italian places in town, always coming back for more. The manicotti is awesome along with the fresh bread and dipping oil !",1
I thought I should write a review since there isn't too many on here. Signed up for there unlimited tans for 24$. There is an initial fee which I think that's lame but still such a good deal. I committed to 6 months so the sign up fee was only 24$ plus 24 a month. The lady at the desk was super helpful and very nice. Had to help 2 new customers and was happy to sign us both up and get the beds clean and ready. Kinda small place but great service and beyond great price. Will keep you posted since I will be a regular for at least 6 months... I ve only tanned once and it was fabulous,1
"Holy smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket, Batman!  Love this chain, this is a clean & friendly location.  They have the best kid menu options IMHO of any sub chain.  Someday I need to try the other subs, but I keep going for thay brisket.",1
This place is always busy so I had to give it a shot.  Excellent from the service to the taste of the food. There is nothing on the menu I dislike so far,1
"l ordered a ""kangaroo"" (totally forgot its name, it was the first thing on the menu) beef burger; with a side of onion ring and fries.  The onion rings are Gorgeous.  The beef burger is the best l've ever had.   And the server was very nice!  10/10 would reccomend.",1
Of course I found this place on Yelp nice little family ran joint. Excellent chefs nice lady who waited on us they were fast and friendly.The sashimi was excellent we had the screaming O and the poki salad along with salmon tuna and albacore sashimi every thug was fresh and delicious,1
"Best donuts I have found in Mesa or AZ in the 28 years I've lived here! Excellent selection, Friendly people and YUMMY!",1
"I am a coffee snob.At first I was put off by this place because of the lack of any decor or ""coffee shop"" feel. There is a huge bar, and a couple of couches, but it lacked the usual university students hanging out with their laptops and books. (Probably because of the summer, and distance from the university). However, the woman at the counter was super friendly and ended up serving me the best coffee I have had in Tempe so far. Bubble Tea is their most popular drink here, but they also have ice cream, fappes, and espresso drinks. They have only been open for 5 months (they had a different location before) but they have the drinks down pat. EDIT: I noticed the other day that the espresso machine they use was a super-automatic. That really surprised me because usually that is a signal for ""run, the coffee will be bad."" Still, the coffee is good. A little on the sweet side for an iced latte with an extra shot, and just a little flavor. But everyone of my friends who have tried it have loved it.  I am also pretty sure the soy is free there :D yay. So I guess the espresso must just be really good quality there if it can go through a super automatic and come out pretty good. I will keep looking for the best iced soy latte in town but so far this is my pick.",1
First time there and loved loved loved it. Great casual welcoming atmosphere. Super service but not annoying. Food was superb. The view of Cleveland at the end of the short road is historical. Can't wait to return,1
"Hubby and I dined here this summer on our annual Vegas adventure!  Although they were busy we were able to score a table ""outdoors"".   Prices reasonable, drinks generous pour and yummy!   Had a seafood feast, everything was cooked perfectly! Waiter was attentive but not overbearing, just the way we like it!",1
"Simply amazing and satisfying food!! Unbelievable hidden gem. My wife and I, our new date night spot!Excellent service! Thanks Chef Ryan",1
Greek Family ran love it. The Turkey and stuffing is full of flavor. The menu is large very large but you will find some thing for you. And the spinach bite dinner just eat it.,1
"These donuts were fantastic. We were in the area on vacation and as is customary, I had to find a local donut shop. I could not have been more excited to stumble across this gem! My husband picked out an old-fashioned, chocolate-glazed donut. I grabbed a chocolate covered sprinkle raised donut as well as a chocolate-covered cake donut and I was blown away. Amazing crisp outside with soft inside, not too doughy and perfect frosting ratio. We were incredibly impressed, and the prices were great too!",1
"Best sandwich I have eaten in a long time. The bread was fresh, so we're the vegetables nice and crisp. I will be back to try the other sandwiches.",1
"Better than BoSa ... the locals have been wrong. Try the blueberry or strawberry varietal.Note: 35-cent charge for debit card but, really, guys...it's 35 cents.",1
"My daughter has been saving up and begging for a pet bird because one of our friends has one. I said no over and over always explaining the responsibility of owning a bird. She had given up hope! I totally surprised her after a family lunch at cafe rio and we went over to Petsmart. Nathan at Petsmart was great. He listened to all our little stories and and she was so excited when she met ""Jacob Franklin"". Her new little Green Cheek Conure. His nickname is ""LilJ"". She was so surprised! Nathan knew everything we needed to set him up and we couldn't have had a better more memorable experience. Pets are family and apparently she will have Lil J for a VERY long time! I'm thankful she saved her money for a lifelong friend and Petsmart was the place!",1
"So impressed by the exceptional service Extreme Lighting & Grip offered my company. One call to Rey and the process of shooting in Vegas was well on its way. Rey accommodated our G&E order, delivery, and went above and beyond by helping us find crew in the area, which was incredible since we are not local and it was a last minute shoot. Thank you so much to everyone at Extreme Lighting & Grip who helped us while we were there. - Jaimie",1
"Belle initiative de Potloc qui à permis d'aider la proprio d'ouvrir ce café/studio de yoga ! Quelle trouvaille ce Belém Café sur St-Laurent. Ouvert depuis août 2016, j'y suis allé expressément pour le café plutôt que le yoga, pour essayer leur bol d'açaï et leur latté pour déjeuner. WoW ! Première fois que je mangeais un bol aussi santé que ça. Mon bol d'açaÏ (7$) avait beaucoup de goûts et de couleurs, choix santé. Pour le latté (3,75$), on vous donne le choix pour le lait; soya, coco, amandes. Les prix sont abordables. Déco zen, style yoga. La propriétaire est souriante et a de l'entregent, ça paraît, j'aime voir des entrepreneurs/ses qui sont passionnés par leur nouveau projet comme elle. Wifi gratuit. J'ai adoré mon expérience pour lire ou travailler sur place, pour sûr, je reviendrais avec ma copine ou seul. Wifi gratuit. 5/5 visité en septembre 2016.",1
Great experience. We did the Golden Eagle Air tour with Limo pick-up at our hotel. everything went according to plan. The limo was top quality and on time. The facility is very nice and very well maintained. Very professional.Our flight was a great experience. The helicopters are very confortable and our pilot (Mary?) was very knowledgeable about the area we flew over. Tons of super interesting facts were discussed.This flight was definitely with the money.,1
"What a great place!!!My girl and I share the same birthday and every year we do it up. Taking a road trip somewhere and enjoying our time together. This time she planned a big shindig in LAS. She wanted to go here to Stack. One of her top 5 restaurants. So, of course, I agreed. I've never been here. But it made her top 5 so...What an amazing place!!! The decor was beautiful. Dark woods and a very romantic ambiance. Candle lit tables and a very attentive wait staff. Our waiter, Manny, was amazing. Helpful and knowledgeable of his menu.  We had the meatballs to start. Get them!  I'm not going to describe. Just get. We then had the Caesar salad.   Which was totally ""homemade"". You could actually taste the anchovies!  Amazing.  My girl had the sea bass on a bed of lobster risotto. My word. So delicious. Sea bass cooked to perfection. Flaky and juicy. But the risotto? Wow. I mean wow. Chunks of lobster with every bite.  I mean my girl said she'll dream about this dish until she has it again. I had the 14oz Brooklyn filet with whipped, not mashed, potatoes. Filet cooked to a medium. Which in retrospect I'll get medium rare next time. Not that this wasn't good medium. It was great!  Juicy and tender. On the bone no less. Which just adds to the flavor!!!  Served with a red wine reduction and peppercorn barenaise sauce. This truly enhanced the flavor. Didn't take away or overpower the meat. The whipped potatoes you ask?  Truly wonderful. I asked my girl to make these next time we have steak and potatoes. She said yes. Of course she did. She loved them as much as I did. After all this we were spent. Then Manny brought out our Birthday desserts. Vanilla ice cream with ""happy birthday "" written in chocolate. Truly a simple but heartfelt gesture on the part of the Stack staff. Meant so much to us. All in all. Go!  Go and enjoy Stack. The staff wonderful. The food to die for!!!",1
"Great villa!  Spacious, clean and the service is wonderful.  Much better than your typical timeshare. Lots to do for kids. Highly recommend.",1
"The pizza here is terrific. The quality of the ingredients is what does it. It's all so fresh and prepared so well. I like how you can customize with so many options on the menu. Varieties of sauces, cheeses, veggies and meat. It's rare to see so many options. And the prices are too good. The pizza here is worth double that. I've never been in to eat. I've ordered it through postmates every time. But I now don't order from anywhere else.",1
"Went here thanks to numerous recommendations from other yelpers. We were glad we did. Definitely small, so a wait should be expected on busy weekend mornings. Luckily we went during the week so we were seated immediately.  Food was great though, and service was quick and friendly.It's in a neat area too so come for breakfast/brunch then take a walk.",1
"Great employees!!! Constantly offering amazing service with a smile and their perky small talks, it also offers an abundance of products, well stocked for your daily needs and demands.*** I frequent this Safeway so much, that they even recognize me by name!!! :) That's ALWAYS AWESOME, there is also a great lady very worthy of mentioning, by the name of SUSAN working at the Starbucks inside this location and she is ALWAYS SUPER FRIENDLY and bubbly!!! I adore her!!! No hit or miss with her!!! Always greets me by name with a genuine smile!!!*** Also, wonderful cashiers and meat departments employees!! Honestly everyone at this location is super nice, I always leave with a positive experience!!!",1
I fought the boyfriend about where to eat and we ended up here and I wasn't disappointed! I had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese! Oh my gosh!! So delicious!!! The staff is beyond friendly and takes the time to show you all your options. The staff really helps make this place along with delicious food! Defiantly a must try!,1
"This place is absolutely amazing! I love them! I will never go anywhere else & I recommend them to all of my friends and family. A couple if years ago my yorkiepoo Tank swallowed a hook, line & sinker. It got lodged & he had to have emergency surgery to have it removed. I was extremely upset because I didn't have the money to pay for a surgery for my animal but I was willing to do whatever it took to get it done. My animals are a part of my family & I would go into debt up to my ears to save them. A lot of people would take advantage of that but Arrow Animal Hospital did not.  It didn't cost nearly as much as I thought it was going to & this office was more concerned with the health of my pet then how I was going to pay. Thank god for care credit. :) Im very happy they take care credit here. What a life saver. Recently I got a new puppy. A boxer mastiff mix. Her name is Maddi & she received all of her vaccines & puppy care here. They are so good with her. Yesterday she was spayed and the doctor called this morning to see how she was doing. I am amazed that they make the time to do this. They are always busy but I can see why. They go above and beyond the normal care. They really care for your animals & are friendly & compassionate. You won't be disappointed if you go here",1
Thank you!!!! Thank you Magdalena and others here for being a light in the world. Maintaining a positive upbeat service and humor in the last place you'd expect - an airport. Where travelers looking for coffee are more often rushed or crabby than anything else. It reminds us to just breath because there is still good in the world.  Their relentless positive attitude is a contagious thing that can be passed from person to person exponentially and what better place to do that than a hub where the thousands they serve will disperse across the world to spread that positivity. And the coffee is good too.,1
"This was my first time in this restaurant and the meal of the day was lunch. There were 3 of us to start, then a 4th joined 5 minutes later and then a 5th a few minutes after that to round out our table of 5. We were greeted promptly at the door, asked our party size and immediately escorted to a table. The restaurant appeared to have a decent amount of business but our server arrived at our table within 30 seconds to get our drink order. It might even have been more like 15 secondsWhen the 4th person of our group arrived, he was greeted almost immediately by our server as well. Our server checked on us again before our 5th showed at which time we decided to order without him. I asked about the fish and chips to which she didn't give the standard answer of ""it's very good"", but instead said ""I really like them"". I liked that answer and 3 of us went with the fish and chips.While waiting for our food, our 5th arrived, and he too was greeted quickly, and his food and beverage order taken quickly as well. Our food arrived within about 7-10 minutes, was correct for everyone at the table and even the late-comer received his food at the same time. The fish and chips were actually quite good. They were very crunchy on the outside but still moist on the inside. The other two guys who had them also really enjoyed them. Our beverages were kept full, the server checked on us several times throughout the meal and presented us a bill in a very timely manner.I simply can't think of anything more she could have done. We left and on our way out, we were wished a wonderful day by the bartender, our server and the hostess.I will definitely return!",1
"Everyone here is always so kind and helpful. I've consistently gone to this smoke shop for the past two years and every single time I have been satisfied. I've visited a handful of other smoke shops in the area but HQ's staff, prices, product variety and vibe in general is unmatched",1
I have had wonderful experiences with this service. Reasonable price to Pittsburgh airport from Scott Township as well.,1
"Always love this place - I think the food is great and the service when the good staff is on, is fantastic.I highly recommend it - but let's not make it too crowded so that I can't get in...",1
"I've never had their full pizzas or hoagies, but their pizza by the slice is really good! The cheese is $1.80 a slice and it's always seemed very fresh and they heat it back up in the pizza oven until it's super hot. The crust is super crispy with a bit of chew; just how I like it! There is also tons of cheese and a nice oregano flavor to the sauce. I've also only had nice employees and quick service. They are also open very late (to one am) so are a great late dinner/after drinks place in squirrel hill. They also have a wide selection of beer and even beer on tap.",1
Great potion and taste with great price! Finally lakeshore has some sushi takeout place if you happened not to prepare dinner.,1
"I've never been a huge fan of banh mis but this was the best I've had and has made me reconsider their second-tier status. I ordered the Banh Mi Burger and every part of it was on point. The bread was perfectly toasted, the meat was plentiful and flavorful, and the veggies were fresh. The aoili and sriracha ketchup went very well with the sandwich. Service was very fast as well.",1
It's kinda pricey but the food are huge. I ordered their French Toast -dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup. So yummy!!! It was huge and it taste soooo good! I definitelty recommend this place to everyone.,1
Matcha Cafe Maiko is my go to. You can't go wrong here. Their matcha soft serve is super matcha-y and creamy and just the perfect consistency. The vanilla soft serve is super good as well!! I always get the soft serve mix in the waffle cone and the waffle cone is sooo yummy!!! I could eat it alone lol! They put a little piece of matcha cake at the bottom of the cone to absorb the melted ice cream which is a nice little surprise hehe I have yet to try their drinks and floats here!,1
"Love this place!!! I won't lie, the main reason I first came here was for the bottomless mimosas during brunch time, and they are the reason I keep coming back!! I love that they have so many different flavors of both mimosas and Bellinis, and there is no problem with switching them out and trying them all! The food is also pretty tasty- I can't say no to their sweet potato tater tots and always get them with a side of their green chili cheese sauce mmm",1
Amazing set up this year! They did such a good job! Everyone should go and support this charity.,1
"Had my 1st appointment with Eloff and Gary to buy a house and went great. They explained everything that needs to happen and laid out a plan we will be taking to accomplish this goal, to purchase a house. They were professional, honest and straight to the point on many topics and questions we had. My family and I are very excited to have great professional guidance of Eloff and Gary by our side on this task. Thanks for all the information, help and comfort today guys!!!!",1
Fried chicken is the best around. Also had the Mac N Cheese with bacon which was also great. Love the atmosphere! I'll definitely go back.,1
"Wow... Talk about Service. I've never had an issue with a garage door until now. I found Dreikosen online. I was tempted to try and fix the springs myself, but after a bit of a consultation with my dad, he said just have a Professional do it, and let me say, worth every single penny. Ryan showed up, got to work immediately and even explained to me what happened and why it was getting stuck. He then worked diligently and completed both springs in about 15-20 minutes. I was astonished at the quality of work in such a quick amount of time.Thank you once again. I fully recommend Dreikosen to anyone with any garage door needs.",1
"This is my go-to grocery store, but mostly because it's right by my work. I wouldn't trek out here for the express purpose of hitting this place.The produce is quite fresh and there is a good variety of Chinese and Western options. I love that the greens come already bagged so I can grab a bag of gai lan that keeps me for a few days.There's a big meat section with deals every day and a seafood section with live fish, lobsters, crab, and shellfish.On the other side is a huge section of ready made food, which makes it a great cheap lunch spot. The prices are pretty good compared to non-Asian grocery stores, but my parents think it's ""expensive"". Take that as you will.The parking lot CAN be a bit of a nightmare. Do yourself and everyone a favour and become an expert at backing in. IT'S JUST SAFER.",1
"I am completely satisfied with the service provided. I called about a serious ant problem. One treatment stopped it cold. While ants have not returned, I set up a bimonthly service schedule to keep other insects out. They respond so quickly, the technician was here the next day. Schedule and payments are handled quickly and easily on the internet. They are thoroughly recommended!!",1
"Amazing turkey/avocado sandwich! Fresh, flavorful and perfect crispy bacon. Hands down the best!My husband got the bbq pastrami with coleslaw. Unbelievable!!! The flavors were insane together!! Perfect!",1
They did a great job on our home. We also used them to do an addition at our office. The service on both was great.,1
They are fantastic. I love them. I won't go anywhere else to have my nails done. Everyone there is friendly. Place is clean and bright.,1
Great local place with great food. True Tex-Mex queso with chorizo is awesome! Everyone super nice. Would definitely come back again!,1
"The staff were friendly, helpful and with a good sense of humor. There was short wait outside to get in for our Monday lunch.  The place is pack for good reason. You must try this place if you are visiting Montreal. The fatty smoked corned beef is awesome, perfectly seasoned. Never had it so good. The ambiance is basic. Why wouldn't be? It's a deli. Just a great feel to it.There was not much to not like about this place. My only dislike is, they are in Montreal and I live in North Vancouver.",1
Great food is authentic and the service is nice. i been to the one at 75 ave  as well all around great people,1
"""The Black Hole"" of Vegas. WHO WOULD KNOW a sliver of Canada could be pooped out the universe's exhausted colon and magically end up HERE, of all places???!?! Anyway, my sis took me and we're driving through desert...desert...tumbleweed...desert...hot dry wind-OH MY GOD, WHERE'D ALL THESE PINE TREES APPEAR FROM??!? We're suddenly transported into lush, forest-filled, camping terrain with snow-dotted mountains staring us down(yeah, instead of rude parents; check my Sterling Park review). My jaw stayed dropped the whole time, even after we started the hike up to the waterfall-THAT is another miracle in itself!! Beautiful, beautiful trails winding up to the top with the occasional sandal-clad genius passing by. I was in awe overlooking everything by the waterfall, & not too many people there, thankfully. This place reminded me of my past camping ventures up north and I wanted to go back to the house and grab a tent SO badly!!!! I will hopefully return at some point, as much as I would prefer actual Vegas burning to the ground. XP",1
"I just had my birthday here with about 15 people and I think we all had an amazing time! Specifically I did! Firstly, the service. Our waitress was excellent and she did a great job in being very communicative about food being pumped out a little slower than usual. Only having a few lobster tacos left. And just right from the beginning knowing how to make service flow efficiently! Secondly, the food was amazing we all had a combo of the wings, corn, chips and quesadilla as apps and from my knowledge they were all amazing. Specifically corn and wings were bombbb. Tacos were amazing. My favourite had to be the lobster. As well, just to warn anyone not used to spicy. Personally, I found everything had a good kick but those who weren't used to spicy struggled a tad. I think the only thing I can comment on was the cake situation. So while we brought a cake my boyfriend called ahead of time and asked if that was fine and no one informed him of a 2 dollar charge per person on the cake slicing. If he had known that ahead of time he probably would've purchased the cake from them so communication would've been better on that part.",1
"Friendly quick service, reservation desk is on the same level as baggage claim and the car pick up is right outside the doors on the same level. You can pick your car from the lot. The overall experience was great and convenient",1
"I just ordered from uber eats halal and I normally love it, but today along with my other co workers was very disappointed. We all ordered the chicken platter and all 3 of us had dry and burnt chicken. This is unacceptable that they can charge 12 +plus tax for a meal that is like eating jerky! I don't mind spending the money either, clearly I have eaten her before.... But you should never send food out of your restaurant that is not perfection!Update:Right after I posted this review Angela reached out to me I believe she's the GM. She apologized for the bad experience and wanted to make up for it. She offered me and my 2 co-workers a free meal next time we come in. I wasn't sure if the girls would want to order again, until I talked to them . We decided to give it a go again since every Saturday we order out as a ritual of ours (our cheat meal). I text Angela and she was so helpful and took care of the whole thing. When it arrived we were all nervous... Pleasantly surprised though! The chicken looked perfect not dry at all, we all took our first bites and agreed that this was the best we had ever received from halal!! The flavor was on point! So a big thank you to Angela for making us all believers again!!",1
Very good! Met friends for happy hour. Will go again! The Hazelnut dessert was to die for,1
THE best place for a quick bite! Visiting from Arizona for annual Vegas vacation and we stop here EVERY year. My 9yr old thinks the people of Boulder City are crazy to not be filling the place to eat. I agree!! Savored every bite,1
"Fantastic! Met the owner and he has a fantastic personality. Gave us samples to try a variety of poutine and even let us take a photo with him. The food was hot, flavorful, and filling. The service was great and the staff were knowledge. You could tell they enjoyed working there and provided the best possible service!",1
It was great I was running a late. I had just got done with work they were super nice and still got my car right in. I thought it was cool to watch the oil change be done on my car. I am by no means a car savvy person I know where my gas goes in and where to put windshield washer fluid so I am always a little worried that I might get take an advantage of. But that was 100% not the case here. I was told a couple of things that could use some attention but I was not made to feel like if I didn't get my tires rotated right now my car would break before I got home. I will definitely take the drive across town for service work to be done here. All thanks to Groupon.,1
"Great clean place for dim sum! $3.20 per dish before 11am on weekdays, and the menu extends after 11, as it gets pricey then! There is always a crowd, even on weekdays, and after 11, so be sure to get there early! On the menu, they mark their specialty dishes by using purple ink! Notable specials include their mango mochi and their BBQ pork bun with a crispy top! There is free wifi, and the password is on every table, which is a really nice addition on top of their already good service and cleanliness!",1
I am beyond excited to share my review about this flower shop. The florist is very  detailed in her work and always exceeds my expectations. The flowers are always at great quality and they last forever!! Great customer service and great prices. It's a heavenly garden of beautiful flower arrangements. This time I ordered flowers for my mom on  Valentin's day over the phone and they were ready in a few hours. This flower shop is the best in Gilbert Arizona! Would highly recommend to all of my family and friends. Thank you AG flowers for putting a smile on your clients faces on their special day.,1
"Throughout this entire year, Every interaction and appointment has been completed effortlessly. Dr Wu and her staff provide excellent customer service and have never failed to book me in when needed. Thank you for taking care of me! Until next time!",1
Truly excellent service. The staff was very pleasant and quick to serve. The food was also delicious and very reasonably priced.I've been to almost every sushi place in the valley and can say without doubt that this ranks among the best of them. Well worth the visit!,1
"Went there to eat lunch on my wife's bday and they didn't disappoint us food was super fresh super fast and the server guy was very nice ,we will be back soon!!!!",1
"Me and my friend Jorge tried krazy sushi for the first time. Our waiter was Yoonie, she was on point with everything great customer service! Everyone was cool they greeted when we walked in. There good lighting and the place looks spacious. I will be returning here again and recommending my friends. AYCE!!",1
"I would argue that this is by far the best brunch place on Walnut Street. The food is very flavorful and the servers are always pleasant and attentive. The crepes are perfectly done and none of the food is ever greasy or dry. I've had many versions of the French toast, along with the Alaskan crepe and Sofia (pictured). Definitely add sausage too if it's not already included. On top of that, they have some of the most detailed latte art (even with soy milk). It's well worth the wait, which may get up to 40-50 minutes on the weekend.",1
"Went to check out the Containers centre downtown. They only been open few months so not a lot of options for food. Decided to walk towards Fremont experience. Where I came across Radio City pizza. Was greeted right away. Loved the atmosphere. It had a full bar and a lot of TVs. Service was great and food was awesome. I had salmon salad. Salmon was seasoned perfect and moist. My boyfriend ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza. Tasted fresh and was very hot. The sliders were yummy. Was on a sweet roll for bun, chipotle mayo, think was Swiss cheese. Meat was juicy. Normally not a fan of sliders but had good flavor combos. When we left we were greater by the owner. Very friendly and gave us the scoop about the history. Very interesting... You could tell she cares about her customers. She took the time to talk to us. And caters to her customers. I'm a local and will definitely be back again.",1
The tacos are amazing. I am addicted to the carne asada tacos. They come with cabbage and cilantro. But all the other dishes I've tried have been good as well. The food isn't dripping with grease. The ingredients taste fresh. It almost seems like healthy Mexican food. :),1
"I'm a HUGE fan of Guy Fieri (especially Triple D) so for my one night trip to Vegas, this restaurant was my number one pick. It was my bud's 21st birthday too so we had a party of 6. It was a Saturday night and we found the place after arriving on the Strip (great location at The Quad) and put our names in. I loved that we could just give them our numbers and chill out in a casino until the table was ready. After we were seated, our waiter introduced himself and the night went from average to TOP NOTCH. His name was Chris Anderson and not only did he know his stuff, but he was incredibly attentive and did everything possible to make our first visit THE BEST. We ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer and it blew our minds so much that Chris kept bringing out their truffle aioli later for our entrees. Between all os us, we took down the Mac & Cheese Burger (literally one of the best burgers I've ever had, everything down to the lettuce is flavored to a T), the Steak Asado tacos, the Double Barrel BBQ wings, and the Cheesecake for dessert. We only spent one night in Vegas and all we can remember is how good that meal was. They even put candles in the cheesecake and sang happy birthday. The only way it could have been better is if Guy himself was there, but eating at his restaurant was the next best thing.",1
"Update: they've changed recipe... The bread and the mixed greens are both a little pedestrian now.  While it's still very good, it's no longer the life changing experience once was.The eggs Benedict here is by far my favorite meal in Madison.  It's better than the bibimbop at graze, better than the pizza at grandpa's, it's even better than the rhubarb crepe at Bradbury's.  And they somehow manage to make it taste healthy (for restaurant food).  The pastries are pretty top notch too, definitely recommend the peach danish.",1
"Very helpful staff. Bartenders and cigar shop employees were very kind and helpful.. Not to mention, patient with our amateur selfs. Once seated, the waitresses never really checked on us. However.. The bartender kept checking in. Very relaxing. Loved the atmosphere.",1
Great food omg that i actually crave..... mac n cheese amd wimgs is a must! the service is amazing never dined in but for take out they know me n my husband by our first names highly recommend best neighborhood bars I know!,1
"I was really impressed while dining here for their soft opening.  We were coming here for their Pho Dip Sandwich but unfortunately they ran out.  And although I was bummed I browsed over the menu and actually found it hard to decide since all the selections sounded good. I decided to try their Chicken Salad Sandwich with dry cherries and walnuts and my husband tried the Char Siu Roll.  We also got to sample their soup of the day which was Clam Chowder.I believe their concept of serving their food with a twist really works.   My Chicken Salad Sandwich was more on a take of the Hawaiian/Chinese dish~ Cold Ginger Chicken. The walnuts and cherries were a great touch making this an amazing tasting sandwich.  This also came with their delicious thinly sliced taro and potato chips dusted with Furikake made in house with a side their Kimchi pickles. I seriously think they should think about selling jars of these pickles and bags of their chips! Addicting! Now the Clam Chowder soup served with toasted crostini was incredibly delicious with a Thai twist.   It had the right amount of heat, clams, potatoes, and Thai influences.  It was not thick but more of a broth.   I joked with the owner that this had to become a regular and not a special, but I was really serious!   I know I am going to be craving this soon and would love to see this on their regular menu. We finished with a delicious and generous dessert offering of their Pumpkin Crunch and Red Velvet Macarons with Honey Butter. Both delicious but with the fall approaching, that Pumpkin Crunch is going to be a hit!.The place is nicely decorated with a modern touch of bamboo, red and gold, and the tables are nicely touched by a Buddha vase (once served as a Buddha alcoholic drink) with a bamboo.  They also offer complimentary lemon infused water which is a pleasant touch. The food offerings are delicious, the pricing is fair and the service was splendid, making for an amazing dining experience and great first impression.  Can't wait to return to try more of their menu as I can easily see myself becoming a regular patron",1
"I went to Creations and Alterations because of high Yelp reviews, and they didn't let me down!  Friendly service.  They sewed on a botton in just a few minutes and I was out of there.  $3.  I'll be back for their friendly and quick service.",1
"I love this place!! I had the Halo Halo and it was SOOO GOOOD. This place is clean, bright and the workers are so friendly! I highly recommend this place, I'm definitely coming back to try their snow and more!",1
Nikki is amazing period! She knows exactly what will look best on you and always makes sure you leave 100% satisfied! I always leave with a natural looking tan that doesn't smell and literally lasts longer than my regular appointments! Besides looking amazing her prices are also on point! I will definitely not being going anywhere else for my tans!,1
"Phoenix City Grille - What can I say, another FANTASTIC meal.  I'm conditioned to expect a restaurant to falter.  I travel so much and eat at so many places and they never have the ability to maintain a certain level of quality...  But thank goodness Phoenix City Grille keeps a very high level of service and quality.  One of the best restaurants in all the cities I travel too, if not the best.",1
"No lab coats or caged frat boys used as test subjects. This is a straight up craft beer scientific discovery. Located in the back of a strip mall in glorious Mesa, AZ is a very unassuming and even a little plain looking brewery. The lay out here is like any normal craft beer house that also serves food. Minus the glass beaker lights hanging from the ceiling. I came here with the family and a very friendly server, who not only had the low down on the beer, but the food as well, greeted us. There were so many options I decided to go with a mini flight, four beers of my choice. I went with the Vanilla Porter, The Street Cred, War Paint, and 480G IPA. These all being served in a brass knuckle holder. Vanilla Porter - Great taste and very mellow on the vanilla. I could only taste it on the finish., and for being such a dark beer this was surprisingly light. I would order this again. The Street Cred - This beer was good, but it's what I call a palate destroyer. If you start with this beer, end with this beer. It will alter your taste buds so you can't get a solid flavor profile from other satisfying suds. 480G IPA - Great classic IPA. This is the beer you should order while looking over either menus, food or beer. Great choice for the craft loving newbie. War Paint - This was my favorite and I could have had three more pints of this. Super smooth and great flavor. This beer will be my go to next time I'm at BRI. I also ordered some food on my trip here, the ""Spanglish"". This mutated breakfast sandwich was the perfect pairing with my beer filled flight.  Meat candy, an over easy egg, provolone, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle sauce. All of that on sweet Hawaiian bread. Not sure why it's called the, ""Spanglish"", but I didn't care either. This beast was delicious, the ultimate in breakfast styled food porn. The egg was cooked perfectly and the yolk ran down the sandwich as soon as I cut into it. Pure goodness. Was I blinded by science? Yes. Craft hoppy science!",1
"About as good as it gets for an Italian restaurantI usually go into these reviews recalling my recent experience, thinking of anything positive, negative, or noteworthy. Except in this instance, I found myself thinking extra hard for anything negative. And well, there simply wasn't anything significantly negative about the experience. Well, they could use more parking. We got there early enough for a spot. But when we left, the cramped parking lot was already full for dinner. On to the food. It was great. The bread, pizza, pasta's, desert, etc. Everything was freshly made, seasoned properly, and just tasted good. I wasn't a fan of the tea, but other beverages, wines, all quite tasty. Service was also excellent. Our waiter was one of the best we've had. Very attentive and friendly. The restaurant itself was classy, very clean, and upscale looking. As you can see, the negatives are quite a stretch. The important stuff was all great. While we probably won't be back in AZ anytime soon, we'll certainly visit again in the future.",1
"awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint. yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought. i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later! hands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!",1
Service was very quick and staff are friendly. Lots of great drink options to choose from. Also love the garage door entrance and the vibe of the place!,1
"I was visiting Port Credit looking for bridesmaid dresses and then decided to walk the streets looking for a place to enjoy a nice lunch. It was a Saturday - so my fiance and I waited until a little after the lunch rush and decided we felt like a good ol' bowl of pasta. Papa Giuseppe's to the rescue! Upon arrival, the outside and even the front entrance way of this place are not the most glamorous. We were not deterred though, and ventured in to be seated in what looked like was a back patio that was still being enclosed due to the weather (this was an exceptionally nice day, but others were not as nice so I understand). The decor is seemingly old Italian type traditional and a little drab but really, no big deal now let's get to the food!The menu is quite large - with pizzas and pastas a plenty. I ordered the Gnocchi and my fiance ordered the Carbonara. Two of my most favourite dishes so I was ready to be impressed. Boy was I ever impressed! The food came out really quickly, it was literally steaming hot (probably the hottest dish I have ever received at a restaurant), and smelled delicious. We decided to share both dishes with each other and I instantly regretted it because I loved the Gnocchi so much, it was so decadent and creamy, with walnuts in it too! The Carbonara was really tasty as well, with lots of Porchetta - but I just couldn't part with the cheesy Gnocchi. I was ready to shed a tear when it was finished. Papa Giuseppe's, I do have to say you surprised me. From the drab decor - I was served up some wicked delicious and filling pasta dishes. I would definitely order both again (next time I am eating the Gnocchi to myself though, yes I am greedy). I even saw people cutting their Pizza with scissors! I am going to go back again just to do that!",1
"Southwest Bimmers is the best! Having car repairs done is something you usually dread, but not here! Hannah gets you in and is so pleasant to work with. They are honest and competent. No trying to sell you stuff you don't need. They quickly diagnose and take care of your problem and get you out the door with a smile on your face. I wouldn't take my BMW or my mini anywhere else!",1
Ladies here are the absolute sweetest! Always do a great job on my nails and do any design that i ask for.,1
"Best Thai food!My boyfriend and I stopped here for an early dinner before catching a movie. Be warned- even on weekends they do close mid-day although the hours posted on the internet show it is open all day Saturday and Sunday. We arrived a few minutes before they re-opened at 4. No worries- there is a great beer store a couple store fronts away, so we shopped for some beers to bring to dinner (it is BYOB).We came back at 4 and were seated right away. My boyfriend and I both ordered drunken noodles and spring rolls to share. Fantastic Thai food! They sprinkle fried garlic on top- so good! They veggies seemed really fresh and I don't think they were frozen, which many Thai restaurants will use. Overall great food and service!",1
Dr.Balmy Fang and Jen were absolutely fabulous. Cooper our 14 year old doggy was treated really well. They did a thorough overall exam of Coopers general health. I was given a comprehensive plan of what Cooper needs to sustain her senior years. Thank you so much for the making me feel good about our visit. I will definitely be returning.  I will recommend Dobson Ranch Animal Hospital .,1
Great Family Practice Physician who is top in the field in Sports Medicine. I have had my share of medical issues as I have been active in Martial Arts for 40+ years. I trust Dr. Walter P. Vanhelder and his knowledge of Medicine. He has kept me healthy for many years. That is a major thing all by itself,1
"Came back to Las Vegas and wanted something really good to snack on. I was going to take the Pork Belly Bun to go and have my friend try the most delicious Pork Belly Bun I've ever tried in my life!!!!While, I was ordering, I saw a couple who ordered a Rack of Short Ribs. It looked good and I asked them how it tasted. They suggested I order it. So, my friend and I decided to order that and Pork Belly. Boy oh boy, the Rack of Short Ribs melts in your mouth!! It's super tender and juicy. The meat just falls right off the bone. It's so good!! Next time I'm back, I'll be ordering that again!!",1
"Such a great place! The staff greeted me the moment I walked in and handed me a menu. Although the menu is very limited almost everything was perfect. My friend ordered a salad and I must say skip on the salad and go straight for drinks and tacos. -The chips and salsa were delicious.-The carne asada tacos were delightful! I almost freaked out because my tortilla was green and it made me hesitant to try but they were great. -My friend had the flour tortilla barbacoa tacos and mentioned that they were really good as well. -I had the blended margarita and it was good but I must warn you it is strong! So if you plan on drinking do it slowly. Overall a great atmosphere, great food, and awesome service!",1
"Simply amazing!!  The lines get really long.  We went right at 8am and had no problems, but during the day, when all the tours are in effect, you may wait more than an hour.  Don't forget to go to the back and see the blessed sacrament room.  This is definitely not to be missed...",1
"I'm baffled by the bad reviews. This is the closest chase to my home so I always stop to deposit my cash through the drive thru ATM. However after depositing all of my cash i went to the store and my card wasn't working. I was so confused as to why so I rushed back to bank and I got there at 6:02, they close at 6. I thought about just leaving but realizing I need money I went in as someone was coming out. Now they could have easily turned me away and told me to come back the next day, however I told them the situation and they helped me out immediately!!! It took no more than 5 minutes and she made sure I ordered myself a new card, let me pull out cash and showed me how Apple Pay worked. I wish I could have gotten her name but I didn't want to impose any further. Whoever the nice ladies were, thank you so much!! Your customer service was exceptional!",1
Excellent service. Was there today for a drive clean test on my old Volvo. Professional and friendly service,1
Had the maple dream and it was great. Walked in the rain to find this place. Totally worth it.,1
I have been coming to Pullano's pizza since 1988.......and it is still as good as ever...the appetizer Bruchetta is a big serving for a big party too much for two people but we tried...the pizza well nice crust and nice texture and crispyAnd the WINGS ... I can't go there without getting some me some wings... everything consistently good...remember it's a sports type restaurant!!!Have fun!!!,1
"Go there every time I get the pizza craving while traversing State St. The spinach pizza is to die for, Double YUM! Slices are embarrassing huge.",1
Excellent service! Zach was an excellent waiter tonight! The food was the best! I had a great time here! Prime rib was superb!!! Love it! Love it!!!,1
"Where do I start... There are no words that can express how thankful I am for the service that was provided to me. I had a horrible experience with 2 dental offices that did poor work on a root canal. They charged me so much money before my procedure was even finished. I came across Dr. Thompson after one of the Doctors couldn't find the 2 out of 4 nerves  in my tooth. Dr. Thompson found them easily. He followed up with me that same night  to make sure I was ok. He truly cares about his patients and does a great job. I highly recommend Dr. Thompson. Thank you sincerely, Jose Pena",1
It's always nice to stop by during a weekend and have my favorite ramen in Madison. Although they are always packed service is never be a problem and I always feel warm and welcome.,1
"Olya is fantastic!!  She replied quickly to my initial message requesting cleaning services and she was able to schedule an appointment within a couple of days.  I was traveling out of town on business and didn't even meet her prior to her cleaning my apartment.  Typically I wouldn't do this, but I felt comfortable based on all of the 5 star reviews. Olya did not disappoint and didn't miss any of the details.  My place smelled clean when I walked in. She even washed my bath mats!!  I will definitely use her again to clean my place and appreciate her taking the time to do an outstanding job!",1
"I'm so glad I decided to try this place!  It was a Friday night and I was debating whether I should order from the standard chain pizza restaurant, when my boyfriend suggested trying someplace new.  So we turned to Yelp and found that this restaurant was nearby and had good reviews.We ordered the XL Philly pizza.  And embarrassingly, we finished off the ENTIRE thing.  I tried to stop myself, but it was just so good!  After two slices I was getting pretty full but I *had* to go in for a third slice.  And I reasoned with myself that it was a thin NY-style crust so not as filling as a regular crust pizza.  I liked that the crust, although thin, wasn't crunchy or burnt at all.  It was still soft and chewy the way I like it.  My boyfriend commented that he liked the way the veggies on top of the pizza still had some crunch - not soggy like at some other pizza places.I think this is going to become one of our lazy day go-tos!",1
"So we were looking for somewhere to get an all-out, nothing too fancy breakfast whilst in Montreal, and Yelp led us here!It was pretty busy, but we were seated quickly (we were there about 11.30am). The restaurant was kind of small and actually part of a Hotel which we didn't know about. They had an upstairs mezzanine seating area as well which was nice. Our waiter was really polite and helpful. After we ordered some coffee and OJ (freshly squeezed and delicious), we noticed that their was a football game on we wanted to watch, so we asked him if we could eat at the bar - not a problem! Bartender was super nice and talkative. We had a good chat about the football and places to see in Montreal. Next came breakfast! My boyfriend had the Belgium waffles with strawberries for around $11 which were huge! They were covered in fresh strawberries with a generous helping of maple syrup. I went for the American breakfast with Scrambled eggs and Whole grain toast. The home-fries were good, with onions as well. Bacon crisp, sausage sweet, no complaints for $8! The only disappointing factor was the coffee, I had a few cups because I needed some fuel, but it really wasn't the nicest. But hey, the food ticked every box for what we wanted so we were very happy!",1
"We had very high expectations and Rao's lived up to them. Not easy to do!Delicious beet salad...Ate every last morsel.Top notch veal parm (a flattened loin chop, fried to perfection with generous cheese) It was ala carte so we ordered a side of penne marinara. It could have used a little more sauce.Excellent linguine and red clam sauce. Everything was well-prepared and tasty.Even the olive oil on the table was first-rate--rich color and very tasty, not the typical light colored stuff you get in many places.The only thing we weren't crazy about was the clams casino. They were ""eh.""Too full for dessert!!",1
"I love this community!!  When I started with them 4 years ago I was out of shape and overweight, today, with the help of Coach Matt & Dom, I feel like the sky is the limit!  If you're looking for a change from the same ol' boring gym workout, there is no better place than Camelback Crossfit!",1
SUCH a great show! I come to Vegas for the shows more so than the gambling. This did not disappoint! The music might be stuck in my head for years... But it was wellworth it.,1
"The Parisian hot chocolate!! Liquid, thick, fudgey, served in a mug and possibly the best thing ever created for taste buds. It doesn't stop with the best hot chocolate ever created, there's more! It is a chocolate lover's dream come true, and it's quaint, classy, housing more than just chocolate but who cares about that! This is the cafe you go to after dinner and after the show, where you go when you're not quite ready to call it a night, where you host friends from out of town for dessert - where you stop in for your fix of the fudgey:Flourless chocolate cake, dense and decadentThe shortbread cookies dipped in chocolateChocolate almond hornsBrowniesChocolate tartThick and chewy chocolate chip cookiesAnd yes they serve lemon tarts and macaroons, soups, paninis, quiche, caffeine and even wine. I love this dessert cafe, it focuses on the chocolate side of treats, and does it well. We needed a place like Chocolaterian in Madison. Having only opened in October 2012, I think they have quickly found their place in the community.",1
"First time gun buyer, Eddie, Shannon, and everyone there were incredibly helpful, patient, and friendly. They made sure I had everything I needed, but I didn't feel like I was being upsold, rather they were just taking care of me. Prices were great, and the service was above and beyond. Cannot recommend them enough.",1

I was impressed with Dr. Ruth Tan Lim.  She is respectful of parent's decisions.  She took her time with us and was very informative.  She has valuable knowledge and goes over more than just the basics.  She saw my newborn today for a well-visit and we were treated very well.  Thank you.,1
"My dog loves this place!I was initially hesitant to bring my sheltie here based on the prior reviews, but the location is convenient for me so I decided to give it a try.  Before dropping my dog off, I asked for a tour.  The place was clean and the staff genuinely seemed to care about dogs.  When I asked them about the yelp reviews, they told me that they were aware of them and most of them were unfair since they were for other locations.  I also took the opportunity to speak with some of the other owners about their experience, which also seemed very positive.  All in all, I decided to give the place a try.  All I have to say is that my dog loves this place.  She gets so excited when we drive up to the door that she starts wagging her tail.  Once I open the door to my car, she tries to rush past me so she can get inside.  As to each of the staff members, she loves all of them.  While my dog is super friendly, she is extra excited when she gets to greet the staff members.   The only other time I see my dog act like this is when she is excited to visit our friends and family.  Anyway, this is a really great place.  The staff all genuinely like dogs.  They are always excited to see my dog when I bring her in, and know each dog and each owner.  The facility is clean, offers grooming, and is super convenient.  You should know that the dogs are placed in their rooms during lunch and dinner, so you might want to ask about that if that is a concern of yours.  All in all, I really recommend this place.",1
The best Aguachile I have ever had. Also very kid friendly. My family was introduced to this restaurant years ago by our mom Lupita Valerde as being her favorite Mexican restaurant. Good Margaritas also,1
"Love the food. I am From New Mexico, land of Hatch green chili. Was surprised to find this place when my family moved to AZ and doesn't disappoint. Have yet to find any good Mexican food in Phoenix besides this place! Isn't the same as New Mexico but delicious and pretty darn close!",1
"Celebrated my birthday this past weekend 11/25/17  by seeing CHER.  Staff was aware it was my birthday and surprised me with a free upgrade to FLOOR seats. Front and center. Staff was super friendly and helpful, as was the general manager that evening. Truly made my night memorable!",1
"I wanted something different so we checked online for a good Italian restaurant. Fiamma had outstanding reviews so we decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did. Our reservation was at 6pm, but when we arrived early at 5:40pm (expecting to have a drink at the bar until our table was available) we were seated immediately. The restaurant is located in a small strip mall, but don't let that fool you. Inside the tables were beautifully set and the waitstaff was ready to go. Our waiter.... Fabrizio. What can I say? He was perfect!!!  He started by asking us if we had any food allergies (Brilliant!).  He recited the specials with passion and accuracy. He made every dish sound amazing and we wanted to try it all! We chose a buffalo mozzarella (with a soft cheese center) as our appetizer. It was delicious. The pesto was the best I've ever eaten in my life!! After the appetizers, we were given a sorbet to ""cleanse the palate"" and boy did it work!! My next sip of wine was full of flavors and complexity I hadn't noticed prior to the sorbet. Great idea. For our entrees, I chose the Mediterranean Sea Bass and my husband chose a fish broth with seafood. The descriptions given by Fabrizio were spot on. The sea bass was grilled to perfection and did indeed taste trout-like. It was topped with shrimp and scallops, and was served with spinach and roasted potatoes. We paired it with a mild white wine that enhanced the flavors of the fish well. My husband's fish broth came full of shrimp, mussels, scallops, clams, monkfish and squid.... and the ""broth"" was rich and creamy and FULL of flavor. Throughout our dinner, Fabrizio was was anticipatory and attentive. I can't say enough about Fabrizio. He was passionate about the food, genuinely sweet and well mannered. An absolute delight. The other staff brought us things and cleared our plates too. Absolutely world class service from beginning to end!!!We definitely recommend Fiamma!!! I can't wait to go back!!! Thank you Fiamma, for a delicious dinner and a relaxing evening. We will see you again soon.",1
"Greg is AMAZING!!  My wife and I had a horrible experience at EZ Tattoo, and needed our entire half-sleeves redone, and Greg made us LOVE our tattoos.  He is patient, incredibly insightful, inventive, creative, smart, talented,  funny, and does superb tattoo work!  I could not be happier about the work he has done for my wife and I. When you find the right person for tattoo work, you never want to let them go, and Greg is stuck with me.  If you have something that you need covered, something new, or want some ideas, talk to Greg.  He will make sure that you are both on the same page before starting and make sure that you know what your tattoo is going to look like when it's done.  Go see Greg at Third Eye Body Art in Mesa!",1
Robb Harrison served us and his recommendations were completely perfect!  Insane appetizers and the BEST General Tso I have ever eaten in my life!!,1
I recently dined with friends at Il Tetto and had a really nice time.  My friends can be beer snobs but they had something for everyone.  The food was really good too.  Our server suggested some of her favorite items and they were on point.,1
"Really nice place to bring your band to practice!The people that run it are really cool and know how to make feel bands at home, we are very thankful of all the gear provided to us! Will definitely come back!",1
"Great food, great service. Very charming decor. Had the avocado toast it was fabulous. My husband had the beef sandwich and loved it.  Can't wait to come back and try the waffles",1
"Good casual chain. Mimosas are 6.50. Prices are good, portions are large enough. Many options. Similar to Eggspectation perhaps a bit more upscale/trendy ambiance than eggspectation.",1
Fluffiest donuts I've ever had! We've came here countless times over the past 2 years and LOVE them! They even last DAYS if you're getting a giant box. Don't turn hard and crusty like other donuts-- still tastes fresh days after purchasing. It was also my biggest pregnancy craving last year! Lol,1
"Stopped into Zanzibar following a flight into Cleveland. Parking was convenient - the location had a parking lot right next to it that I think cost $3? Reasonable in comparison to the 5-10 you're charged where I come from for a spot. The food was FANTASTIC. We started with the soul rolls which were delicious! Stuffed all sorts of good stuff and served with a spicy, cajun like sauce - totally hit the spot after hours on a plane.I had the honey glazed fried chicken. The portion was HUGE and gave me plenty of leftovers. Food was served piping hot and was just out of this world in terms of flavor. It's rare to find a place that actually SEASONS their food and does it well. Zanzibar hit the mark on it. The grits were creamy, the house potatoes were perfect. My friend had the catfish which was equally delicious. Loved the fact that they served unique and creative drinks here. When was the last time you could get kool aid at a restaurant? Its outside of the box and I love it!Service was awesome and attentive. The food was beautifully presented and could definitely be described as upscale soul food that stays true to its roots. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area!",1
Mastros is my favorite fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas!!!! There ribeye steak is grilled to perfection and is so tender and juicy and the lobster mash is a must as well! I've been celebrating my birthday here for the last couple of years now but this year I was a little disappointed because they didnt serve the warm butter cake as my birthday desert,1
I had a check engine light on my truck took it to josh and the guys for smog and the helpped me yet it right and back on the road very fair prices great attitudes and really good guys gonna reffer as well as bring him more biz,1
"It's very unusual to have a five-star rating from almost every reviewer, but Bradley Carpet Cleaning does and deserves it.  Brian did a fantastic job.  Our furniture and carpeting look brand new.  He's hard-working, meticulous, and takes pride in what he does.  In addition, he's extremely reasonable and stands by his estimate.  He's totally honest and doesn't try to sell you something you don't need.  I would comfortably recommend him to anyone.  He's just a super guy.  His wife sets up the appointments and she's very nice too!",1
"Great food. Local business. Great people. Small and hidden away, this is my go-to on the way home, or a quiet local place after golf. This the kind of sushi place you wish you had next to your house. I do. So there!Update on best roll per another user - It's going to have to be the Tanaka roll - obviously obvious. Also, the Knock Off is choice. But really, just ask the owner (he's usually the one rolling) and he'll make something special for you.",1
"First meal in Toronto was amazing! Congee Queen had fresh authentic Chinese cuisine. Every plate was savory and delicious! My husband loved the deep fried Chinese chicken and egg/meat congee so much he had it again the next day for lunch. I absolutely enjoyed every bite of the fried turnip dish. The fresh snow peas, duck and pork were great as well! I'll definitely be coming back during the week we're here and recommend it to anyone in the Mississauga area.",1
"This is the freshest sushi in Pittsburgh and surrounding area in my opinion. My husband and I have been eating here for a number of years. We have eaten from their roll menu, sashimi, and traditional menu. Our favorite rolls are the Geisha roll (heavenly!) and the yellowtail roll. The shrimp and broccoli is sooooo good it's a tough decision which to order. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients. The staff is friendly. If you have room for dessert definitely try the strawberry mochi.",1
"Couldn't be more satisfied with the customer service that I received from Overson Roofing. These guys were great -- After a huge storm came through, I began to have leaks everywhere throughout my kitchen. I immediately called a few different roofing companies as I started to panic. Overson Roofing responded immediately and came within the hour to install a emergency tarp for me so that there were no further damages done in case other storms came our way -- which several did in the meantime before getting my roof repaired. These guys were so handy and helpful... Not only did they install an emergency tarp, the crew noticed a small hole in the roof causing a serious problem and without question temporarily patched it up for me so that no further damage could occur. From how quick these guys responded, their crew being top notch, and the GM that I spoke with... All around it was first class. Thank you Overson Roofing!",1
Excellent classroom facilities and computer labs. A real asset to uptown Charlotte's academic community.,1
Sushi was good! They had a roll with flaming hot cheetos inside.,1
"All I can say is YUM! This place is awesome in so many different ways! We were staying at Planet Hollywood for my birthday weekend, and after a day worth of drinking, walking and going to Thunder from Down Under, we wanted a snack so my friend recommended this place. I didn't really think anything of it because I though, ""Sandwich? Whatever, it's like Subways or Quiznos."" I was totally wrong. I ordered the Earl club and it was the best sandwich I've ever had! The bread was perfectly toasted, a little crunch on the outside and nice soft and warm on the inside. The cheese was perfectly melted and blended into the meat and the bacon was savory and crunchy! What makes this place even better is it's open 24 hours! So while I was drunken passed out on the floor in my hotel room, my awesome boyfriend got me the American Sub and a brownie for the morning after. Even though it wasn't freshes, it still tasted awesome and the brownie tasted like it was homemade!  OH and the sandwiches are huge! It's more of a meal than a snack in my opinion!Only downside is that the lines get pretty long and the wait is even longer. When I went with my girls, we waited at least 15 minutes to get our order taken and then another 25 minutes to get our food. However, it was well worth it and I'm not even that big on sandwiches! I would totally recommended this place to anyone who hasn't tried it!",1
"Usually not a fan of chain restaurants, but we came here today for my moms birthday. Have never been to this location. Customer service was amazing and the food was very good. Ended the meal with cheesecake, birthday style for my mom. It was a five star day for sure!",1
Always a great place to bring out of town family and friends phonominal Phood .........,1
"I can't say enough good things about Bolsa!!  We recently started going there when we were still on the hunt for our ""go to"" Vietnamese restaurant.  Our search stopped here.  Food is amazing and ""Mama"" and the staff treat you like family.  We always walk out of here with a smile :)",1
Fantastic food and best service for casual food in America. Plaud to their staffs! Well done!,1
"Found this place on yelp. I was at the Phoenix CC for two days standing at a trade show. My feet, my toes, my back were killing me. We had a 3 hour break at the event and went for one of the best reflexology appointments ever! It was an hour of heaven!!! Next time I'm in Phoenix , this will be one of my stops.",1
The noodle is always fresh and nice. Terrific food! We love it!Definitely come back again!,1
"Heather & Tom, the owners of The Speckled Hen, are warm and welcoming! It's a lovely spot that is surprisingly close to the Madison airport with easy access to freeways, yet feels as if it is out in the country. We were amused to have been assigned the UW Badgers guest room....filled with red & white Badgers paraphernalia! It's good that our beloved Kentucky Wildcats weren't playing against them the weekend we were there! The breakfast was delicious and plentiful. And, if you'd like some wine at the end of the day, these former Californians know their wines and have a lovely selection from which to choose. We'll definitely be back & highly recommend The Speckled Hen.",1
"5 STRONG STARS!Annette Thomas is the only person in las vegas that I will let color and cut my hair!Honestly I know I say this all of the time but she should be working doing the hair of the rich and famous in Hollywood she is that good! The movie stars would be lucky to have her work her magic on their hair!I opted for a color and style I have not had before so I went with the ombre color. Three different tones of stunning red with some caramel mixed in! A mix of paprika, burgundy and cinnamon just make my hair stand out. I have gotten so many compliments that it is to the point of annoying lol I feel like a movie star!Ombre hair swept the nation almost as fast as rumors of the zombie apocalypse went rampant on the internet, and since some of the biggest fashion trendsetters have committed their ends to a little punch of color just as I have. I know I am on the late freight but that is my own fault. Annette has been cutting and coloring as well as styling for years. She is a whiz with the scissors. She could cut my hair with her eyes closed and it come out Amazing she is that good! She has an Awesome fun personality as an added bonus!She does a kick ass foil weave which is my favorite since everything blends so well and for a more natural look. Her specialty is color, multiple colors she can blend and create like no other! At one time I had four colors perfectly blended in to perfection all colors complimenting one another. That was a color job that made people go ape shit over, you would have thought I was J-LO with all of the attention I got over it.The best part of all is that her prices are reasonable. Every time I have her do my hair I feel like I am ripping her off but she makes her prices as she is independent not working for a commercial salon who charges more for overhead etc. She has a location in the west part of town and east! I love her west side location is a private salon where I don't have to worry about people staring at me while my hair is being done! lol I don't like that.Call her and make an appointment she is very flexible!(702) 435-6422Her email is annette4thelord@yahoo.comGo see Annette the color and cut specialist and you will look and feel Fantastic or my name ain't Nikki Hernandez! :)",1
"Paranoid Parents... if you have more than 2 young kiddos, don't come by yourself on a busy day.  Team up with a group of moms & dads.  This place is amazing for elementary to junior high, but for your high energy little ones be sure you *CREATE A GAME PLAN. Talk about ""stranger danger"" and make your kiddos smart to the plan so that you don't have a 1 Star experience. Beautiful park!!!! We loved it",1
Having a great dinner and time with family and friends during this holiday weekend.  Great atmosphere and great food.,1
"Everyone should try this place out.  i went there today for Lunch with a friend.   First time there.I not only judge a restaurant by its food, but also the service and how clean the establishment is. Let me say.. Service is top notch and this place is super clean.   Not to mention the food.  I purchased the Sheppard's Pie and my friend got the Chicken and Mushroom.   Deadly !Needless to say, I just placed an order for takeout tonight.      this place is awesome!",1
"Place was great! The stylist Johnny did an awesome job without making me feel uncomfortable. Usually salons are very uncomfortable for men, but the Parlor was a breath of fresh air.",1
Excellent BBQ place. Plenty of meat that is moist and delicious. Service was equally great. Can't wait to comeback.,1
My husband and went to Russo's on Thursday evening.  It was fantastic.  We sat at the end of the bar that overlooked the kitchen and chefs.  Everyone was very nice.  The chefs took time to talk to you while they were busy cooking.  I ended up getting the shrimp and grits.  I'm not a fan of shrimp and never had grits. It was wonderful.  One of the best meals I ever had.  I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.,1
"We were visiting Old Montreal in the middle of winter, and a lot of restaurants were closed.    There were 8 of us in the restaurant.  The place is very nice inside, not too formal and not too casual.  Exposed brick walls, nice lighting, etc.  The waiter was very professional and  polite.  The menu was extensive, and not the ""usual"" dishes seen at an Indian restaurant. We ordered oignon bhajee as an appetizer, which was so delicious!  I got  a curry dish, dupiaza with veggies, and my partner got saag with veggies.  As opposed to a typical Indian restaurant, these were not doused in sauce, and the veggies had a nice char taste to them and were SO delicious!  I couldn't stop eating!  We would go back in a heartbeat.",1
"Bliss Flow Yoga is fantastic.  This yoga studio offers many different styles of yoga, including my favorite, vinyasa flow to good music. Guest instructors fly in from all over the country to teach workshops. Some BFY teachers provide head and shoulder massages with essential oils at the end of class of class, which is just heavenly. It seems like BFY caters to a slightly older crowd, more fitness-oriented vs. spiritual/mind/body- oriented than other studios in town, probably because of its location. But I happily drive there from the Willy St area each week! The studio is calming and spacious. No mirror so you can't get distracted by how sweaty your hair is. They also run membership specials frequently, so it's likely that you can pay $8 or less per class. You can borrow mats, blocks, and straps and there is ample room to store bags and shoes. The changing rooms and bathrooms are large and clean. I can't wait to try a Yoga & Wine workshop!",1
The gentleman Tom educated me about the system and directed me in what I should do. They took care of me right away with my A.C. system for my truck and now my kids will not have to complain about the heat while they ride with me.,1
"I was craving Greek and I found this amazing restaurant. Very specious inside and they have outside seating as well. This restaurant is located on Ft Apache and Patrick close to Russell. I ordered filet steak kebab plate, it is so delicious and so tender. The plate comes with two skewers of filet steak, humus, pita and salad. Come to this place and try it for yourself.",1
"What a wonderful experience from start to finish. The Shop Printing has been very easy to work with. Not only do they do quality work, but they are flexible and communicative throughout the process. The Shop provided a faster turn-around time than expected, and went above and beyond by sending us photos of color swatches so that we could see what we were getting. Check these guys out for excellent products and customer service.",1
Wonderful pedicure  (deluxe) excellent selection of polishes and scrubs. Very reasonable prices,1
"I had the Quebec raised lamb w lentils and veg. My kids had the flank steak w blue cheese sauce and my husband had the scallops. All dishes were carefully prepared and tasted amazing! Quiet trendy place, good service and reasonably priced. I would go back anytime!",1
This place was incredible. The spinach and artichoke dip was a 10 Star appetizer.  The Salmon and the Sage chicken where both to die for. Please check this place out. The staff is friendly and the food was out of this world.,1
"I could write pages on this mall, it's the best   mall from value and quality perspective. It's our best hangout and we end up shopping every time we go because the deals are really worth it. You name the store and they have it here, with the additional new wing, there are more stores lined up. Every store has some sort of deals going on, the Calvin Klien is by far the best here followed by Gap Factory Store. Like we purchased Jeans from CK for $20, tops for $20, with their store promotions on top of the reduced pricing, it will be hard for you to to miss a deal !! Gap always has 40% off on men and women's apparel as well check out their clearance section for infants and kids. We got pretty good deals here.Recently Kate Spade opened up, and they have 60+20% off, we got a deal for like $60 bag. Crocs had promotion buy one get one free, 2 great pairs for $50. Another great deal store is Nike, if you're lucky you can get great looking shoes for under $50 here. There's UGGs, Nine West and many others in shoe apparel. For Watches, don't forget to visit Fossil and specially Watch Station, we took 2 Michael Kors watched from here for under $150 each. For Exclusive Shopping, there is Holt Renfrew and Saks Fifth avenue. For Cosmetics there is Body Shop, Sephora and MAC, Chocolates Lindt, Rocky Mountain and Purdy's. Winners Homesense has great great collection here, you will find excellent quality and value stuff here for sure!!For Sunglasses, visit Luxury Eyewear, we got 2 Gucci Sunglasses from here for $700. For kids, there's Legoland Discovery Toys R Us, Disney Outlet amongst many others. Food Court also offers a variety of options and has a lot of seating. Washrooms are easily accessible and many with Nursing Rooms as well. Because the mall is so extensive and cool, parking can be an issue, but still there is ample parking on all sides. Trust me, if you are a Shopper like us, you will thoroughly enjoy this !!",1
"I knew absolutely nothing about this place.  I saw the sign for a Thai food buffet in front of the restaurant on my way back from Home Depot.  I went the next day to try it out.  I have been looking for a good Thai food buffet for the last 15 years.  This place isn't good; it's fantastic!  The food was totally spot on - as good as any Thai food I've had anywhere.  I can't comment on the regular menu, but the buffet is amazing.  The couple next to me was so excited to find out that I was a first time visitor.  They stared at me when I sampled my first bite, and they couldn't keep their excitement contained to find out what I thought.  It was as wonderful as they had suggested.  The couple eats there three times a week.  I don't want to eat anywhere three times a week, but I can totally understand why you would be tempted.  I'm hooked, and I've only been there once.",1
"This restaurant (particularly, Esther) was excellent in helping me organize my boyfriends' surprise 30th birthday bash. It was a great turn out based on the service we all received. Service: Servers were very attentive and organized. There were about 3 waitresses taking our orders. We were a medium sized group of about 20 people. And none of us had to wait long for our food or drink.Food: Excellent for a casual resto/bar. There is a great assortment of items to choose from, including gluten free options. I recommend the parmesan truffle fries, roasted mushroom melt burger, and almond crusted chicken tenders. Everything on the menu is under $20! Atmosphere:We had a long table set up in the back, it made our gathering more private. There was enough room for all of us to walk around to chat with one another. The ambience is great with a good balance of volume of music and lighting. The restaurant was very accommodating and made every effort to honour my requests (ie. decor, cake cutting, set up) which definitely made me happy and made my surprise party a success. I highly recommend this place for any occasion!!",1
"Excellent food, great view, and service with a smile.  We always eat there for breakfast every visit to Vegas. This last visit, we ate there three days straight.  The pancakes (crepes) are as good as it gets and the chicken sausage is unbelievable.  Where else can you eat right on the strip, people watch, have a view of the Bellagio, eat excellent food, and be pampered by caring, knowledgeable staff?",1
My kids have been going to Hilgers for years! I have recommended them to friends and family. My older kids love going and my two year old hates it and screams and cries the whole time...but they're great with her! So patient and understanding!,1
"Decent service. Breakfast was awesome. The manager Nate was on top of everything. Touching tables, cleaning, getting drinks. Pie specials today also",1
My girlfriend went here several times and has had great luck. More recently I had to stop in because my tire valves were leaking. I was prepared to pay a few hundred to have all the sensors and valves replaced because I have a rather long road trip in the near future. Turns out my tire valves were only loose. They tightened them up and didn't charge me anything. We've had several great experiences there so I definitely recommend them.,1
The burgers are okay and prices okay. Overall for price and taste i think I still prefer in n out. They do use nice variety of meat . My low rating is cause I have called and asked if halal but there is no way to be certain it is halal . It is not listed in the website like other franchise locations and corporate has not returned and email at all to me. If you don't care about halal I would say it's about 4 stars. The shakes are very good and fries are nice.Update:Changed review to 5 star after calling owner and verify it is halal .,1
"Paint Masters just painted our entire home and they did such an incredible job. They arrived on time every day and when they finished the first job we wanted more done, they showed right back up the next day. Their work is fantastic and they even put up with us changing our minds about colors part way through, no trouble at all! Seriously, if your looking for painters, look no further. These guys are phenomenal!",1
"First of all, the space is GORGEOUS. Think rustic farmhouse, with white walls and warm, wooden furniture. There's a lot of greenery in the space via hanging plants, and the space is evocative of the type of fare they serve - unfussy, incredibly fresh tasting food, with an emphasis on greens. You have to try the Henry Salad (sesame miso dressed frisee sprinkled with bits of dried mushrooms that are flavour bombs) - the tuna crudo was good, but just couldn't compare. I can honestly say if I had the salad alone I would not have missed the meat. My server (John?) was lovely and recommended the butterscotch pudding - YES. John is right, listen to John, it is FAB. Everything at the resto is meant to be shared, but I polished off an entire one. It's flecked with flaked salt, which provides just the right amount of savouryness to keep it from being cloying, and is SO rich. Yum. 10/10 for everything, would return in a heartbeat.",1
Great food and really friendly staff! It didn't take much time to get our food (~5 min). Prices have gone up a little bit in comparison to the pictures uploaded by another reviewer but there are also more things on the menu! The venue is well kept and there's outdoor seating as well.I had the Reina Pepiada ($7.50) and an empanada de carne ($1.50) and both were delicious! I would definitely come here again!,1
"You Don Ya - Great food, great place, great service, great staff, and even greater DON!!!Kim, the young, brilliant manager, made us feel welcome and treated us more like friends than customers, hard to get that atmosphere in a busy place like this.  If you want Japanese rice bowl, their specialty, don with loads of toppings, this is an excellent option. Recently had dinner with family (a member celebrating birthday) at this restaurant on Dundas and Bay and it was a very enjoyable dinner! Every don tasted amazing, tickled our tastebuds. We tried each other's meal and all of them were absolutely delicious! Highly recommended are the most popular, Karubi Don, (beef done to perfection,) Hamachi Nabe, and Kaisen Don.  Portions are perfectly sized, hats off to the chef.Overall our dining experience was very rewarding. We were even complimented with a delicious birthday cake, which was totally unexpected.  Needless to say we all left the restaurant with a great sense of joy and happiness.  Will surely be back and would definitely recommend to friends",1
"3 week manicure, is definitely not an understatement or exaggeration. I've had my nails done here several times now, and haven't been happier with the colour selection, and quality of work. They really do a really good job here. It's obvious the girls are experienced, and pay attention to detail. They seem pleasant and friendly. I highly recommend them. You get your money's worth out of the service for sure. But book an appointment, they seem to always be busy.",1
If you like fried brussel highly recommend the heaping portion to start enough for 4..meatloaf is yummy and shrimp and grits we special ordered with just shrimp bacon and cheese! Very delicious!,1
"You'll notice this place has 5-star reviews across the board, and after my first experience with these folks I can see why.  Puff n Fluff is clean, professional, efficient, and did an absolutely beautiful job of grooming our 16 year old Lhasa.  They're very busy (as successful businesses usually are) but appear to handle the volume quite easily.  The front desk person said it would be about 3 hours and it was.  Plus they asked all the right questions about the dog and listened to what I said about her special requirements.",1
"Best salon ever!!  (And I'm super picky)Aside from being gorgeous on the inside - I feel like I'm in a super contemporary MedSpa/ultra lounge; everyone that works there is top notch in their field. They are SO good there that I switched from my old salon that I had been to for over 10 years!    Their cuts and colors (Todd) are truly spectacular and I've had the best make up application (Brandy) of my life done there too. With blow out and special event hair (Hannah) they are second to none.  Platinum Entourage provides an ""experience""...not just a beauty service. Seriously, you won't be disappointed.",1
"We tried the oolong milk tea and the tea was very flavorful. Most of all the boba tasted very fresh and chewy. We would definitely come back. Wish it comes in even larger sizes because my husband and I were fighting over the drink! The cup is cute but too narrow for us to keep and reuse. Overall, I recommend this place!",1
awesome food everything was so flavorful price was not too bad considering the amount of food that youll be getting and the customer service was amazing.i will be coming back for sure,1
"Murrysville has tons of restaurants, but nothing really unique. Just the same old. One day, on my way to Wendy's for a ho hum burger, I looked at the side of the road and saw the  ""worlds greatest gyros"" sign I had passed so often. I decided to pull in on a whim, and boy was it a good idea!I ordered the Gyro platter for $9. Well worth the money! You get a ton of meat, rice, hummus, two pitas, and a salad. The tzaziki sauce is the best I've ever had, the meat is the most flavorful I've ever had, and the hummus was delicious. This is a hidden gem of Murrysville!",1
"This place is amazing! Free boiled peanuts, awesome rotating drafts, and the local cheese plates are to die for. Dog friendly patio area and rare brews for sale. This place is a home run!",1
"I gave five stars because Ernie's delivers exactly the experience you'd expect - a divey bar with a great atmosphere and an approachable crowd. I'm new to the area so making friends is always nice. Ernie's attracts some down to earth people from all walks of life.The staff is super friendly, though my husband didn't care for the karaoke DJ, said he was rude. Harold was our main bartender last night and was great to chit chat us up. Service wasn't horrible once the place got busy, but it looked they could have used another set of hands.Excited to try the crab cakes! TBC...",1
The bushido saki was very smooth and a great start to the meal. I had the ginger scallion noodle with a poached egg. Mind blown. Tried my friends wagyu Tri tip meal and it was cooked to perfection. Wait staff was super friendly. High recommendation. Two thumbs up,1
We've order from this Dominos for both delivery and takeout and have always had a great experience. The pizza was delivered promptly/it was ready for pickup as promised as well as tasted great and fresh! Friendly staff as well!,1
"Unique cute stop - father, son owned. Wonderful service by son and staff. Had the sugar bush latte and spinach friatta and my husband had the porridge. Quick easy off the interstate will definitely be a stop to make in the future again.",1
"Absolutely delightful! Tried this place on a whim with a friend today instead of making a Starbucks run while at work, and truly believe I'll never go back to Starbucks/Einstein's. The owner, Aisha, was extremely warm and welcoming to us and was delighted to find out it was our first time in. She gave us a brief overview of what she had to offer for both food and drinks, and advised she makes everything from scratch, also importing her coffee beans directly from Ethiopia. We got simple Americanos so I can't rave about the other surely-delicious offerings they have for coffee/espresso, but cannot wait to return to try the variations of loose-leaf tea. For a light lunch/snack, we split the Ful Medames, which completely lives up to the roaring reviews it's received. While chatting with her about her shop, she mentioned that she loves the people she meets, and it's more of a hobby of hers than work, and her face confirmed she was completely speaking from the heart. She was practically glowing with pride, and it's absolutely deserved. I'll certainly be returning, and I am already spreading the word to coworkers!:)",1
Our central air unit was not operating properly so we reached out to Adams HVAC and they had Marco on the scene within the next few hours. He gave a descriptive detail of the problem and fixed it within the hour. Marco gave us 5 star service! I highly recommend calling Adams.,1
"I moved at the end of December. A very last minute move and I was so stressed out.  They made everything so easy.  It ended up raining the day before and the guys were trekking through mud at the new location, I felt so bad, but they were still very quick and no complaints at all.  Amazing experience!",1
"This is a review for the main music hall upstairs, although I have eaten dinner there several times. I've probably been to about 10 shows here so far. This space is amazing. There's not room to dance unless you get up in the aisle, but this is one of the most intimate places to see a band. The sound system is great, you hear every word, and you're so close to your fave musicians. This is all within biking distance of my house so no need yo deal with parking. The beer is a bit expensive and the food is decent.I've also been to private parties with people from out of town, and they were equally impressed with the space.  I can't say enough good things about this place.",1
I love this place. The service is on point and the food is delicious. For the price you get so much food. I've tried the Pad Thai and a couple of the curries and everything I've had so far has just been perfect. I always recommend this place to my family and friends.,1
"I love Westwind drive-ins. You can pull up in your jammies with kids in tow and not have to worry about them bothering other movie-goers. Great value, excellent popcorn and concessions and good quality digital picture and sound. We literally come here every weekend. It's one of those family traditions I look forward to enjoying for years to come.",1
So happy this finally opened downtown! Best lunch place. The chopped salad is the best!,1
This place would never work in New York because so many people would jam themselves in here that it would explode.I love basil chili minced chicken. It's called gra praow or something. They have it here and it's great.I also had some weird northern pork sausage dish that I ordered because it looked weird and it was also greatGood wine list. Very fair prices. Lots of options.All the people in the kitchen look like they are working in a hospital. Just another indication that quality is very important here.Entrees are about $11. Generous portions by my standards. I ate 1.5 entrees because I'm a glutton for excellent Thai food.Medium spicy was enough to make me sweatBest meal I have had in Vegas on my own dime,1
Girlz Ink is located on Jones in between Desert Inn and Sahara. I found my this place and Amber while searching for a place to get my eyeliner tattooed. After reading so many reviews on yelp and Facebook I started following Amber's work and loved it. The shop is super cute and clean. I love the way they designed it. The receptionist is really nice as are all of the lovely ladies that work here. It was a very welcoming atmosphere.Upon arriving I was offered a refreshment as I filled out my consent forms. Shortly after I was greeted by Amber as she took me back to her room. We talked about which eyeliner style would go best with my eyes and she did an outline. After agreeing with how symmetrical and nice it looked we continued onto numbing. Amber made sure I was always comfortable. She numbed before and in between every pass. Her pressure was perfect and passes were smooth. Amber's work is amazing. I love how my top and bottom eyeliner turned out. Follow her work on Facebook and IG to see her profile and previous work. You won't be disappointed. I definitely recommend her to anyone looking to get their eyeliner tattooed.,1
We came here on Sunday the waitress always very ni e and polite. The food came out on time warm and it was very good. Worth the money for aure,1
"So, SO good! Burgers are fresh and fries are crispy. The line looks longer than it is. But well worth the wait!",1
Everyone was so nice beautiful smile and good service!!!good place to start morning and good coffeeThank you Alina!!,1
"This place is way better than its 2.5 rating (SERIOUSLY?!).  Great dim sum, nice atmosphere, good service.  The con is that it's in the middle of nowhere, I'm pretty sure this area used to be a field when I was in HS circa 2002.Their har gow with vegetables (they have two types) is better than the plain har gows.  The plain ones are still good, I just enjoy the extra veggies & flavor of the mixed shrimp & veggies.  Everything that had shrimp was delicious.  Large & fresh shrimp in wonderfully madeTheir durian puffs are amazing.  In fact, all of their pastries are amazing (kudos to their dim sum pastry chef!).  I'm not sure about other reviews complaining about service.  My mom is pretty demanding in Chinese restaurants and Yang's staff and managers dealt with her in a way that made her happy.  She is not easy to please and very vocal if she is not happy.We came pretty much at opening time on Saturday morning for dim sum and there were a fair number of open tables, but it quickly became packed.  My aunt told me this place opened up pretty recently and here's to them sticking around until my next visit home!  I would highly recommend this place for dim sum if you have a car.",1
After requesting a quote they were the quickest to answer and the lowest price for what I thought was wrong. The technician was able to come earlier than scheduled which I appreciated so I could continue on with my day. He diagnosed and fixed my garage quickly. He made sure to go through all my options with me and explained everything so I would understand. I appreciated the fast friendly service and would recommend for your garage needs.,1
"This is the best smoke shop I've been to so far. The service is great, and the guy who works there (pretty sure he's the shop owner's son) always makes sure the customers are happy. He's very knowledgeable and does his best to assist people. Besides, the juice selection is great, and the prices are fair.",1
"We don't have these kind of restaurants in the Midwest, so when I make it out to the west coast I usually reserve a meal for these. I've only had boiling crab in the past, and although I like their system, I'll have to say that Hot and Juicy got them on the killer sauces. Don't waste your time ordering potatoes, sausage, and crab. Go straight to the shrimp or crawfish guys. Trust me. Get the whole shebang. But don't do what I did. Extra Spicy. I can now say that I've been in almost every Casino on the strip. (Not to gamble of course, but to USE THE RESTROOMS!)",1
"Best wings EVER! Smoked and delicious, will definitely be back for more. You gotta stop by if you are uptown Charlotte. Hope Joe, the bartender, is there when you stop by, super cool guy!",1
"Checked into this place to see what the deal. I had to cook my own meat!? What!? Ok, I knew that. I got the meat lover combination which was a lot of food but I was paying a lot of money. Fair is fair.I couldn't complain. Everything came out pretty fast after you order. The side dishes were a good compliment. But I was busy eating all the meat and rice with the 3 types of dipping sauces provided. Yum, I am a carnivore by the way. The cuts of meat were fresh in color and no smell. The marinated meats had lots of flavor.The service was just there when you need them, otherwise, they just came and did their thing.Overall, I am happy with the food quality and taste.",1
"Kerry is amazing!  I had a ton of debris in my backyard, and Kerry came and completely cleaned up the yard, and even made an extra dump run no extra cost.  He was professional, pleasant, and extremely hard-working. He gave me a great deal as well",1
This is amazing food at an amazing price. It taste like the food from Chinatown in NYC.  The only place to go in the east valley.,1
"My wife and I did the scramble and it was a blast. Neil provided us with a fabulous experience including lots of great pictures to share with our family and friends. The scramble offered both of us just the right amount of physical challenge. While constantly assessing our ability, Neil always chose the perfect rout and encouraged us with stories, geology and witty comments about life.No special equipment or gear is needed. Low cut hiking or running shoes offer great traction. Upon reaching the summit Neil broke out snacks and drinks. We could see Las Vegas in the distance. It was in stark contrast to the beauty of nature and Red Rock Canyon. Call Neil. You won't be disappointed. He's a gem, the vistas are amazing and the scramble is a hoot!",1
"My friend recommended this lovely place to me and this place did not disappoint. She told me that they didn't take resos but if you have to wait they have a bar area to have a few drinks before being seated. We arrived around 530/6 and was greeted by a very nice gentlemen who set us up at the bar first. They had a great bartender who knew his wine and let us try some wines to figure out, which one we wanted. After having a few sips of wine our table was ready. We were served with a side dish of beans (there is an actual name for it, it is just escaping me right now). We ordered the calamari to start, which was SO good. It wasn't too greasy, light and crunchy. The dip was also tangy and delicious and the price was not expensive at all. For our mains, I had the bolognese and my husband at the ragu and let me tell you, it did not disappoint and we nearly licked the bowl clean. We had some room for dessert and I think I had sticky toffee pudding. I can't remember to be honest, but it was also amazingly good. The service was great, our waitress was very attentive but also gave us our space and the price does not break the bank for good Italian food! I would highly recommend trying this place out, I definitely will be returning.",1
"Heard about this Szechuan restaurant finally got to come here with some friends for dinner.  They have a variety of items on their menu like pork intestines, fried fish, orange chicken,lamb and a variety of vegetable dishes to choose from. We ordered the fish with sweet and sour sauce which is absolutely amazing along with the pork intestines and watercress  veggies, the portions were big enough for two or even three people the whole meal was absolutely delicious. The service was also excellent and their prices are very reasonable. So if you are looking for a great restaurant with spicy food come give them a try. They are located in the same shopping center as 168. I will definitely be returning to this place again.",1
"Visited when they opened and was very happy with the quality at that timeAnd just visited again after a long long time, again by far still one of the best ramen options in the city and priced fairlyOrdered kotteri rich shoyu, roasted garlic shoyu and red dragon, all 3 bowls went back to kitchen empty :)",1
"Called to let us know he was en route, showed up on time, and very friendly. He was very accommodating about my dog riding along. Which was a real life saver. I will call him for all my future needs.",1
I had an outpatient MRI! The admitting people were fantastic very professional and the wait time was minimal. Larry and Mike are great MRI technologist. I definitely would go back for their services again!!,1
I was trying to look for a spot that sells flavoring for juice. I came across DiyFlavorshack and came to visit! Shane was very helpful and got my juice! Definitely gonna come back whenever I need juice!,1
The enrollment specialist Saphire is amazing. She goes into such depth as she tours you around a beautiful school. She cares so much about the students she enrolls. My grand child lights up when he see her. I recommend the school!,1
"Excellent service, above and beyond our expectations. They brought us warm tortillas when we sat, chips and salsa, drinks, dinner. The portion sizes were huge and the food excellent. Would recommend the the skinny margarita!! We will defiantly go back.",1
This has been one of my bucket list restaurants. Worth the walk. Had Elk sausage and had to order a second. The beer selection is fantastic.,1
"Wow!! They have great salsa,  fresh guacamole and yummy tacos. My server was awesome and helped me select a salsa that suited my taste.  I do not like the ""original"" version.  The chipotle and the pineapple habenero are both excellent. This my new favorite late night dinner in North Hills!!  Thanks guys!",1
"Kevin is very professional in setting up the appointment, collecting all information, and coordinating with the agent.",1
Great Customer Service. Food is authentic and reasonable price. Mofongo with lechón is my favorite! All is Great! Thank you for the traditional food away from the Island!,1
"This place is nice and chill, it's like stepping into a time machine into the early seventies.      You feel like people should do the ""norm!"" Thing when you walk in.  Very homey and down to earth.  Great food , I like the battered veggies for appetizers and the all you can eat cod is great.  It's really an excellent bar just to drink.     But the food is very good.    I just like that it feels like an old time bar. It's not a gd buffalo wild wings or some other sports bar on steroids.     It's got plenty of tvs , bit small for my taste but lots of sports games on.   Beer is cold carbonated very good.     And the waitresses are super friendly and are sweet.       They have an all you can eat cod day on Friday.  Could be Saturday..  I can't remember sorry.      I think they start karaoke at 9 pm.   It's fun. I don't participate but I enjoy listening to others sing.     Just don't sit next to the speakers . You will go deaf. They play that shiz loud as f.        If you go in with medium to low expectations you'll leave happy.      I like this bar.  It doesn't try to hard to be like every other bar.   And Is very quiet and peaceful.  Just not during karoake.  But I like the mix.Highly recommend.",1
"These light and fluffy pancakes are delicious!I ordered the Fuwa Fuwa Signature, which comes with 2 pancakes served with strawberry, blueberry and banana. Portions are enough to share with 2 people as a snack or after a meal. But I would recommend just getting your own because they are sooo good!The interior is small, with orders over the counter. There are only a few seats, so expect some wait time during prime hours if you want to dine in.",1
"I came here yesterday for my first time with a girlfriend. It's a little bit of a drive for me, but it's so worth it. I love their salon. They have rooms just for pedi's and massages/waxing. Monica did my nails oval and did a really good job. She took awhile, but I can'tComplain too much, she is a perfectionist. Everyone was really nice there. Great customer service. I plan on coming here again.",1
My boyfriend and I visited this place down at the SW area. Love the variety of ice cream flavors. I always tried their affogato and it was the bomb! Last time I visited I had their affogato with caramel ice cream. I just love their mixture of their coffee and ice cream. My boyfriend had their hot cocoa and it was good too! The people working here were very welcoming! I will be visiting here again!,1
This place is awesome the queso the guac and the tortilla soup are off the hook... And ask for Arnoldo he's an amazing waiter!!!,1
"What can I say but AWESOME???? This little shop is cranking out solid dogs and fries in short order! Like a well oiled machine, my $$3.35 gets me a fully loaded Chicago dog with fries that are fresh cut right into the fryer basket!! UNREAL!! Great dog with the right amount of snap, nice steamed bun and perfectly cooked crispy fries!  I can't say enough how great this place is but get there early, there's often a line out the door.",1
Yummy!!!!  I am in Vegas often and this is a staple restaurant for every visit. I prefer the dinner menu over lunch. Make sure you visit this restaurant.,1
"..Station Casinos runs a great operation across all their casinos ..this place is fun and staff always makes sure i'm taken care of..go on a friday night, chill, and listen to the live band",1
"What a sleek, sexy, dark and classy cigar bar. With soft jazz playing, cigar essence in the air and choices of beers on tap, whiskey, scotch and other liquors....sublime. Comfy leather couches, outdoor seating and of course marble bar top seating. Feels like someones large and airy smoking room. Easy parking. No food. Attentive bartenders.",1
My only stop when I am craving Pho. When my family comes to town this is our dinner stop without a doubt! Spring rolls are good too.,1
"Rexall is the drugstore that I usually go to for my prescriptions. They're near my house and give me reminder calls for my refills. But one day, Rexall told me that they were out of one of my prescriptions and there was a month long waiting list I was on. Allergy season makes lots of prescriptions hard to come by. They suggested trying another store, but warned me that waiting lists could be all over town. Undeterred, I remembered that there was another drugstore near the dollar store. So I got in the car and headed to Paragon.The pharmacist at Paragon was incredibly helpful and patient, even during all the back and forth and being put on hold by Rexall in order to transfer my prescription. It took nearly half an hour waiting for Rexall to fax in my information (probably not their fault, it was busy in there when I left to go to Paragon), but I finally got my ""impossible to get"" medicine! Yay! Popped it open and used it immediately (because at that point, my nose was completely clogged and felt like a fist on my face). Quality of life magically altered and ataraxy took over. Thanks, Paragon :D.",1
"This place was quite the find! As we are newer residents, we decided to start hunting out local brew pubs. GREAT decor, tasty brews with creative names (i.e. Cloudy McCuisinart-one seriously good red) and my fave Peach Heff PLUS Tuesday night trivia which attracts quite the crowd. Fun times and local owners!",1
"Decided to go here instead of my usual place and I was very satisfied. Had something simple, hazelnut latte, but it was very good and the atmosphere was pleasant as well. Look forward to trying their breakfast next time I go.",1
"This is my new favorite Cleveland coffee shop. The atmosphere is great because it's a combo coffee shop & hostel. The lower-level is the coffee shop, the upper levels are hostel. I didn't get to adventure up to the upper level patio on this cold day, but next time I'll be sure to check it out!Awesome perks:Bottomless, self served, brewed coffee if you're staying in. Cool & trendy foods to snack on if you need a bite. The barista/owner was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful! He thought to tell me things like the wifi password before I even asked. I can't wait to be back.",1
"I booked Flirty Girl Fitness for a bachlorette party this weekend and it was fantastic!! The staff were super accommodating and very friendly and nice. The facility was gorgeous, the wood flooring, brick walls, girly colours and very clean. We loved it and all had a good time!! There was a minor issue with the music for our dance which used up some time, trying to get it to work every time (not sure if it was the phone, the wifi, or the cords) but other than that everything was great and would totally recommend.",1
Great service here. The GM went above and beyond to help me with my trailer rental. Clean store and well stocked. Would recommend.,1
"We just bought a house up in henderson and this company has been fabulous. Same day service, very very easy to schedule. I called same day and have service call out. Tim with the company is super nice. He came out and fixed our stuff immediately and was very very professional. Will highly recommend.",1
The center now has a computer automated system. The process goes much smoother now. Easy to get in and out in a timely fashion.,1
"Favorite place to land in all of Las Vegas. Makes me feel like I'm back in Chicago amongst the best pubs in the world. The staff is fabulous: bartenders are mixologists not just jackandcoke slingers. The vibe is magical: like the best jazz bar Vegas doesn't have mixed with the chic atmosphere that can only be found in the Art District. Prices are more than fair for the quality ingredients. I highly suggest entering through the front window and spending a late week night as a local amongst a cool crowd, non-exclusive to hipsters. Great whiskey selection too...",1
"Another great meal at 500 Cucina in Calgary!Outstanding service, (thanks George) and the food was amazing!As well, they had a fantastic singer and guitarist performing and so it enhanced the entire evening!Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone!!!",1
"Good beer. Decent variety, which includes beer as well as mead for those who like something on the sweeter side. Prices were fair and staff was friendly.  I was there on a Sunday, and there was a food truck there- appears this is a regular thing.  The space is large and well done, and conveniently located off Butler Street in Lawrenceville.",1
Love this place!  All of their hair stylists are professional and friendly .  So happy I found it:),1
"Saw this place on Yelp and decided to take my family after dinner. Let's just say, we are not disappointed. The place is clean and very well maintained. They even have a corner for kids. I had a Oreo cheesecake with strawberries and whip cream and my son had the Oreo with chocolate. Fiancé had a banana mango with boba and it was amazing. Everything taste very fresh and homemade. The two guys are very nice and the music was poppin",1
"I went thru the drive thru, naturally it wasn't a quick stop but ""hey, I didn't expect any different"". The man who took my order was very kind and friendly, made conversation while I waited at the window. I got home and found that I got the wrong drink, actually I got ""jims"" drink hahaa! I called and they remembered me right away and began to apologize because they noticed as I drove away. Offered for me to come back that night or the next morning for a complementary drink. Another good side as they were open late so I was able to go back that night, mistake or not.. Who doesn't want two yummy drinks in one night?!",1
Did my research and this is one of the only family owned and operated car lots in the area. Major PLUS in my book! Service department is always great when I go in. Haven't bought a car from them (yet) but the salesmen are always nice!,1
"Whenever I travel, I like to try local places and if they offer Pub fare, I often try the Fish and Chips. The beer-battered haddock came out in a sizable portion, light and crispy and the chips were delicious. Cole slaw was fresh and the house-made tartar had just the right zing. Definitely a good choice for dinner!",1
Great energy in this office. Accommodating and great attitudes all around. Today was my first service here and look forward to pretty legs! Thank you for great service and also having a great staff.,1
Authentic Mexican food presented in a modern way. Loved everything about this place. Great knowledgeable staff and vibrant ambiance too.,1
"My wife and I attended this club on 7-1-18. The girls were very nice and friendly. Its a small club compared to the bigger ones but they put on a show. They dont have tall strip poles but the energy and fun the ladies look like they're having makes up. Buy the package though. We had a great time. From the 25 + ladies, to the dj, driver, security ,and Manager extended great service to us on a Sunday.",1
"Sat the bar and received excellent, friendly service even while working on a computer and half watching the Steelers preseason game.  Good local craft beer selection and the Pirogies were the best I've had in the Burgh.  Cool artwork, ambience, and patio area. Definitely worth checking out !",1
"I've been coming here over a year now. Nancy know how I like my pedicure to be done and I'm picky with it, so to find someone that know what she's doing is awesome.",1
Can we just talk about the service for a moment. They make you feel like you're at home enjoying a meal. We had Nate and Tuc. Constantly checking at the right times and making sure all is well. Super friendly! Manager is awesome! They showed my son how to ring the bell they use for birthdays. Food was amazing!! Music is awesome. Definitely recommend and will be back.,1
Came tonight for the burgers and the shakes and we are definitely all satisfied. My SO's mother ordered the Brooklyn Blackout (pictured) and the burgers were gone before I could even snap a picture. I truly love this restaurant and recommend it to anyone coming into town!,1
My friends and I have had dinner here on numerous occasions and always enjoyed ourselves. The food is always fresh and delicious! The naan tastes and looks like it is homemade and very fresh.  I love that we never feel rushed here. The atmosphere is relaxing (nice music) they do not rush you through your meal. The waiter overheard that we were celebrating a birthday and brought a specialty cocktail as a surprise!  How sweet is that?,1
"I dined at the Grand Lux last night and I was simply blown away. When you walk in and you look around, you automatically (or at least I did) assumed it was the Cheesecake Factory, which, to me was a definite plus.The menu is very extensive. For a while, I didn't know what to order because there were so many dishes to choose from. I finally settled on a burger that I can't recall the name of. It was on parmesan cheese toasted bread and it was made to perfection.My friend and I also had a few drinks which were great, too!!When I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely visit again!!Great service, great variety and great hours. What more could you ask for?",1
Got to eat here again.  This time with family.  Sooo sooo delicious.  Had beef noodle soup and beef dumplings.  Wife had chicken mushroom rice.Definitely return again and again.Highest rating.,1
"This place is incredible. If we could give them 10 stars we wood.1. Food is awesome and reasonably priced.2. The drinks are fabulous.3. The staff is incredible.  Kind. Attentive. Sensitive.We originally came to celebrate a birthday of one of her friends the food was excellent the service was awesome certainly five star quality but the best part was unfortunately one in our party we can to choke the manager Kyle was incredible. he took care of everything as our friend was given the Heimlich maneuver. Kyle immediately manage the situation. he brought compassion and and kindness.  A few heartless patrons were put off by a choking person.  Kyle and Elenor, our waitress made up for their callousness with compassion.All in all we will be back.  Many times.  Kyle and Eleanor; thank you so very much for making a scary situation less intense.  Thank you for adding a little humor and compassion. our night continued in a jovial way because of your hard work, service, and humanity.",1
"WINNER!  Situated in the Plaza/Midwood neighborhood with a diverse staff and clientele. My husband got the smaller, 4-item combo platter (BBQ chicken, Carolina pork BBQ, brisket & ribs) with creamed corn & BBQ slaw. I got the Carolina BBQ with bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers. For dessert, we got the banana pudding (oh my yummy) & chocolate-chip bread pudding. The desserts were slow coming out & when the manager realized it, he comped both of them. The place was busy, people constantly arriving & leaving, but nobody waited more than a few minutes (we were sitting near the front door) and ample (& friendly) wait staff helped everything flow smoothly. They get 5 stars for sure. We'll be back for sure!!",1
"This was my staple on the strip.  Thankfully, there is one in NYC, too.  So, I can eat it back home.  Can you say Carpaccio?  The beef Carpaccio is delicious and void of the normal saltiness of the dish.  The fresh pasta entrees (I had butternut squash ravioli) are all to die for.  If I were to do steak, I might head to one of Vegas's great steakhouses.  But, for New American cuisine that is generous and delicious, Olive's is a hit.  Hopefully the NY one is as good.",1
"I had to go to this facility on a Saturday as my regular doctor is closed that day. I got there at opening time and there were around ten people in front of me. The front office staff acted very professionally when checking me in. The doctor (Vu) was also very pleasant, professional, and didn't seem rushed when diagnosing me. The facility is clean and I was seen within an hour. Overall the entire staff was very professional, efficient, and if I have to go to see a doctor again on a weekend I would for sure head here again.",1
"Excellent customer service. I just moved to the area, and was looking for some self-care. I got my eye brows done perfectly. Then got an incredible pedidicure by Bruce. The owners and workers are very welcoming, intriguing, and genuine. This is my go-to nail and pedicure spot from now on! Husband wants a pedicure now after ge felt my feet.",1
Very tasty food and service with reasonable prices. I will be back!,1
"Place, is close to my house. So I decided to give it a try.  At first from looking at the menu, it's seems like there portions are average size. I ordered, chicken & waffles. With an orange juice. When I got my plate I was impressed with the portion amount, it's a lot of food! Chicken & waffle was also tasty and tender. I also like the fact that's it's close to my house.",1
"What's not to like about this genius restaurant?  Well, maybe just the chicken, it was too dry. Now that that's outta the way, onto my review! Because the rest is all positive.Me and my gf celebrated our 2 year anniversary here so I made reservations prior that night.  As we walked in we were immediately greeted and got seated pretty quick.  Our server David, who delivered excellent service by the way, explained how everything works real thoroughly.  After, we went straight to the famous salad bar. My eyes were so amazed at the selection they had. You ever go to a wedding and they had fancy oer'dourves (or however you spell it)? Yeah it's kinda like that but with way more.  My favorites were the smoked salmon, potato salad, zucchini, grilled provolone, the fresh salami, the shrimp!!  I kept sayin ""Dam babe!"" to my gf.When we returned to our table there was little warm bread bites waiting for us.  I wasn't really a fan of these. It was too chewy and almost felt raw and uncooked to me.And now for the men serving meat on swords! There's little pads on your table you can flip that's green on one side and red on the other. Green meaning ""Yes! serve me some meat!"" and Red meaning ""No, but serve me meat anyway!"".  As soon as one guacho serves you, more just keep coming.  They were all really polite and they always served the lady first.  Filet Mignon, Flank steak, sausage, garlic sirloin, lamp chops!! I was goin nuts! ""Dam babe!"" the dinner also came with garlic mashed potatoes and fried bananas.And for the desert, (not included in the buffet) they bring out a platter so you can choose what you like, we chose the Brazilian cheesecake, ($9) but couldn't find anything brazilian about it.  It was still good tho.  But for $46.99 a person, Texas De Brazil is waaaay worth it! Plus we got 25% off just  for joining the eClub at Texasdebrazil.com. Highly recommended to everyone who likes to eat.",1
They have nailed all the wonderful flavors!! Best I have had in Charlotte since I moved here,1
"I wish a had more stars to give.  I've moved 4 times in the last 2 years and have used these guys every time.  I've had the pleasure of having just about the same crew for every move - Steve, Kam and Ben - they absolutely rock!  They are so professional, very quick and beyond careful with all of my belongings.  They always show up at the expected arrival time, they get straight to work and are very efficient with their time.  I will, without a doubt, continue to use them and recommend them to all my friends and family.  Thank you guys for being so amazing!!",1
"We had our ""reception"" (after wedding) dinner here! We had an amazing time with our friends and family and loved the food and drinks!! We were thrilled with the service and all if our guests were ""wow'ed"" by the food and good sized portions! After enjoying food and drinks we went to the stage area with the live band! The band was amazing and we had the most fun we've had dancing at a bar!! We never imagined our night we be so over the top perfect and something everyone who attended is still talking about!! We would recommend this restaurant to anyone for any event...even if it just to eat! :)",1
"From the friendly customer service on the phone to our awesome sprayer, Jose, we can't recommend Insectek enough! Not a bug in sight and they give military discounts! Call now!",1
"Very good a quality seafood, as good as several strip restaurants. Prices are good for the quality, scallops here are hard to beat!",1
"As my place of work is nearby, I often eat here after I get off. The wait staff is very nice and personable and I've only had one so-so experience. The food is cooked well, and the prices are good. I will continue to come here!",1
This place was delicious the menu is huge only sad that we're only visiting I won't get to try everything they offer! Chicken and waffles was a win! The expressi  coffee was perfect!,1
"EXCELLENT FOOD!!!! It was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. Chips & salsa, fresh chips  they are exactly what you dream about when wanting chips &quac!!! The chicken tortilla soup was the best I've ever had. The table side guacamole was delicious, it a a must order!!!! I love that they ask how hot you want it. We had the kids with us so we made it mild, then had to fight my 3yr old for it she ate it with a spoon. ( super kid friendly place, everyone in there was having a good time & much louder than my kids) Fish tacos were very good & SPICY! The shrimp cocktail was good, had a little sweet flavor to it which was different than what we were expecting but it was yummy. Even my sons plain chicken & cheese quesadilla was to die for. I wasn't a huge fan of the fajitas, the meat was very tender and cooked nicely but they seemed a little bland after the rich and perfectly seasoned appetizers. Luckily I was so full from the appetizers it wasn't a big deal.   The service was awesome!!! We didn't have a reservation and it was a busy Saturday night but we only waited about 5mins. The server was friendly, fast and helpful. We will definitely be back.",1
"I am the most picky person when it comes to food, especially authentic thai food. If you love thai food as much as I do, you don't want to miss this place. I ordered all of my favorite dishes and each one of them was incredible. This is by far the best Thai restaurant in the area and believe me, I tried them all! Great service, great environment, on top of amazing traditional thai food. You don't want to miss this place, I hope to introduce to as many people as I can because they're so deserving of it, and it's hard to find this kind of good food these days. My highlights include Tom Yum soup, the Beef larb salad, but all other dishes will be as amazing. Go there once, and see how you become a regular!",1
"US Storage Centers is so close to where I live that I had to stop by and check it out. I had made a reservation via internet, got a prompt response the next day. Gladys was extremely friendly when I arrived for my tour. She was very detailed and knowledgeable as to what information was crucial to know and understand before signing a lease. Gladys event went as far as to get me the best price per month. She also made sure all my access code worked properly before leaving the establishment. Would recommend it to everyone",1
Great service. Zhenia and Nurzhan were great. Long distance move went very smooth. Everything was packed professionally. I will definitely use them again if I need to move again.,1
"I'm not sure why this place has terrible reviews, but it was excellent. Also my boyfriend is Chinese, and he went with me---so not white washed review. The noodles were excellent, and served hot. The pork buns were delicious. The pork belly sandwich was ok. I didn't really enjoy it because there were too many chives in it for my taste, but my bf says that's how it's served. We had fast and good service. A couple minutes after seating, she took our order, gave us water and utensils just a couple minutes later. We got our food promptly despite the restaurant being packed. Unlike other reviewers we had a completely different experience. Will definitely return!!!",1
First time here and loved it.  The staff was super nice and the food was bomb.  I recommend the pretzel appetizer and fried chicken.  The drinks are good and the games make It an exciting Friday night or chill weekday after work.,1
The staff at Swagger does a great job! Easy to make an appointment online or with a quick phone call. Kim is the owner and has done a great job remodeling and adding amenities since buying the shop!,1
"The food was amazing. I had the lunch small plate with collard greens and yams. Oh my! The catfish was cooked to order. My entire family loved their selections. Overall, we had the meatloaf, fried chicken, and catfish. The peach cobbler is ok. This place is definitely worth checking out.",1
This has been my go to place for pizza since 2008 when I moved to Tremont and discovered one late night (early morning) that they sold slices of pizza. And the slices were huge and delicious. The pepperoni is plentiful and spicy and the cheese always feels like extra cheese. Their other pizzas have never disappointed nor have the subs. I don't live as close anymore but any time I'm in the neighborhood I have to stop for a slice.,1
"Joel is awesome and great, takes his time and he is super informed. You can tell he is really trying to help you make really good color and price decisions.Thanks for being so helpful!!",1
Went here on a Thursday morning before walking agreement street and going to the Neón Museum -- there was no wait and our food came out quickly. I highly recommend eating here!,1
"Let me start by saying I was tying to get some food delivered at my house in the morning and most places didn't open until 10am. I decided to see if this restaurant delivered and was open around 8. And they were. I ordered the cheese pizza and the chicken ranch fries and they were AMAZING. My fries were a good portion and coming from a person that eats like a cow that is a compliment. Honestly I'm not even a fan of chicken but their chicken fries were heavenly. The pizza was great my 4 year old had 3 slices. Now let me speak about the service, the guy who delivered it was so freaking nice. I kinda had him waiting outside for a little bit because I couldn't get our dog to calm down. When I opened the door he was so nice and patient.  I'll definitely order more from this place, mmmmm maybe for lunch?...",1
"First time trying laser hair removal & I'm glad I came to this place! Not scary at all, actually kinda fun!! I felt really comfortable after the consultation and every question I had was basically answered! Going back soon!",1
Super fast replacement of my iPhone 6 battery.  Nice guy that took care of me quickly.  I called to make sure he would have time as he fills up with repair orders.He is located at booth J3 in the Fantastik indoor swap meet.If your phone is broken for whatever reason - take it here and get it fixed right and cheap!I trust this guy with one of my most expensive things I own!,1
"Utterly Awesome. Go there.. We recently discovered this small, friendly Japanese-Korean restaurant just minutes away from home. It's inside West Springs, just off Old Banff Coach Rd and down 73rd Street SW a couple of blocks in a small neighborhood plaza.I could not be more pleased with this find. The menu included Japanese sushi & tempura, and Korean BBQ. The owner, Moon, is over the top grateful for your business, and is a wonderful executive chef. You'll be happy you visited this wonderful little place. It only has about 20 seats. It's very busy on the weekend, so make a reservation. Early in the week, you won't need one, although it fills with loyal customers from the community very quickly.You've got to eat here. Go now.",1
"Ate here 2 days ago with a buddy of mine. We had a pizza with sausage and ham, a meatball sub, and the fried dough for dessert.The service was great, the young lady and young man were very attentive; they checked up on us several times. We met Biaggio as well, he was very friendly and checked up on us also to make sure everything was cooked properly. Service was A+.As for the pizza...crust had nice texture. It was crisp enough on the bottom to hold up to the toppings but still soft enough in the middle to fold and provide a nice chew. You won't get the smoky slightly charred crust from a coal fired brick oven which I personally love (since some yelpers have wondered about the oven), but you will get a nice thin crust pizza with a good bite to it. A previous yelper had said the cheese was too greasy, but it was fine in my opinion. Perhaps it did make a difference that he didn't have a whole fresh pie. I liked the sausage quite a bit, the ham was good but nothing special as far as I could tell. I found the sauce to have a nice flavor to it, it was fairly zesty and not too sweet like some other pizzerias. This is just MY personal preference, but I like my sauce to be slightly thicker or more paste-like than the sauce on the pizza here. However, if I had to choose only one between taste or thickness I'd still choose taste. Overall, definitely one of the best pizza options in Summerlin. Plus they deliver! *On a side note, I noticed one of the yelpers on here was talking about not being able to get delivery on football Sundays. Funny, cuz I talked to Biaggio about that when I was there. I also order pizza almost every Sunday during football season. Biaggio said he would be able to parbake the pizza and deliver it on Saturday. Since the parbaked pizza would only be half cooked, you would be able to finish the baking process on Sunday and have a fresh baked pie right out of the oven. Seems like a fair solution to the store not being open on Sundays.Ah, the meatball sub. I have to say it's probably the best meatball sub I've had since I moved here several years ago. They get their rolls from a local bakery here in town and they make their own meatballs. Using a nice blend of beef, pork, and veal along with a healthy dose of garlic equals winning recipe for meatballs in my book!When it was time for dessert I asked about the zeppole and Biaggio explained it to me. Unfortunately he was out of the raspberry dipping sauce which he said just elevates the dessert to another level. So he recommended we try that next time when he has the sauce. Instead, he offered the fried dough which was served warm with a quick basting of butter and dusting off cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar. This was a really nice dessert, the dough wasn't too heavy and it was slightly salty and slightly sweet. We enjoyed it very much. To top it off, Biaggio gave us the dessert for free since we weren't able to have the zeppole with raspberry sauce. How nice is that?I was told the star item of the restaurant is the pastrami stromboli. I LOVE pastrami, so I'll definitely be going back and trying that!",1
"I have been seeing Dr. Skiby for 3+ years, initially at his Port Credit location, and later at his Streetsville location after I moved a bit further to the west. However, I still remembered that the reason I chose him as my chiropractor was due to his very positive reviews, and also his professionalism that I witnessed in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzAP3R5PYfE.Based on my experience, I can say that Dr. Skiby has been very knowledgeable as well as patient when it comes to addressing my issues. His staff, Diesel especially, has always been very welcoming and courteous. I would definitely recommend anyone who is seeking chiropractic care to give him a try.",1
"This place is so cute and cool. It is really tiny (sits maybe about 10 people in total), but it's more of a take-out place. The atmosphere is very casual place. Their menus are written on the wall, and you seat yourselves. The outside looks like something out of a comic book. So cool.It's open late so it's perfect for grabbing a late dinner or snack. I got the tofu burger with fries and a salad. The burger was $2.50, and the fries and salad was $4. Really good price for a meal. The food wasn't the best, but it was definitely worth $6.50.",1
"This is probably my favorite Thai restaurant for 2019! Been back twice and still love it. The decor is just up my alley, cute, chic and those chairs are so comfortable! The ambiance and music are also great. My husband and I share a couple of dishes and desserts. The mango dessert is my absolute FAVORITE AND YOU SHOULD TRY IT :)",1
John was very informative and helpful. He took care of bug control and mice as well. Thank you!,1
"Loved this place! Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. I decided to order the chopped salad and a side of tortilla chips and guac! The salad was very refreshing however, it was a bit large and I was unable to finish it. Guac was also very good.The view is absolutely amazing and they have plenty of seating outside (with umbrellas) , so there is no need to worry about not being able to get a seat in the shade.",1
The Xiao Long Bao was delicious. Hot and comforting broth! Lots of flavor! The restaurant itself was spotless and the staff was amazing. A little off the beaten path of the strip but worth the ride. I will be back for sure!,1
"Such a great place to grab a delicious burger!! My experience here at Red's was awesome. Our server, I believe her name was Cynthia, gave us great service along with burgers that satisfied more than just my cravings. I will definitely be returning!!!",1
The location is not attractive. But they have very good food and yummy desserts. The price is much lower than the strip area.,1
I am very impressed with Kevin in the Service Team; did a fantastic job!,1
"I stopped by for dinner during their soft opening this evening and I was quite impressed... I sat at the bar where Dillon waited on me immediately while providing pleasant conversation. I asked for an Arnold Palmer and although this beverage was not on their list of offerings, Dillon mixed one per my request. I ordered ""comfort food"" - two 4 oz. Pork Chops with Stewed Rhubarb along with three sides - Mashed Potatoes, Black-Eyed Peas and Rice Pilaf. The dinner was delivered quickly and my meal was awesome! I am a big fan of pork chops and they were cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were especially done well - with just the right consistency, texture and a great home-style taste. Yes, I do recommend ""Pie for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner""!!  :-)   Dillon told me that they will be open until Midnight during the week on a consistent basis. This is just the type of restaurant we need on North Craig Street. I imagine the neighborhood will provide a warm welcome to this dining establishment...",1
"WWC is our weekly hangout. A friend bought his house nearby specifically because it's within stumbling distance of a bar. This bar.I've been here probably 30 times in the last six months, usually on Tuesday night when they have their ""buy a dozen, get a dozen free"" special. (It's also good on the ""buy 8, get 8 free""!) Clue: the specials are not available to go, but you can have them delivered to your table and immediately ask for a box. Beer specials are usually a choice of one or two different bottled beers for a discount and maybe a special draft. Tuesday has been $2.50 Corona/Corona Light night for at least six months.The wings are very good. Meaty and well cooked with enough sauce (choose from 33 different sauces from ""virgin"" all the way up to ""Braveheart""). ""Boss"" is my favorite. They recently introduced a new menu with more pub grub items like quesadillas and different burgers, even ribs. Trust me, you want to stick to the wings.As said elsewhere, parking is a bit of a pain if you get there during peak hours. Don't park in front of the nail salon or the dry cleaners when they're open - they will tow you quickly. There's a lot across the street. And yes, the bathrooms can sometimes get a little out of hand. This is one of those times it's good to be a dude. ;-)Every so often, they have a live band. Sometimes they're pretty good. Most of the time, however, they are entirely too loud. I know I'm old, but I'm not that old. I am here to hang out with friends and eat chicken and drink beer. Not shout at them. It was so overpoweringly loud once, I had to write my order on a napkin for the waitress. Maybe the management will get a clue and notice how the place empties out when the noise begins.",1
Dropped in here for a quick souvenir before departing for the states. Very clean and accommodating. They took me as a walk-in so that was a plus. Clean skilled work by professionals of the trade.,1
This place blew away my expectations. I expected the typical boba place with fake tea and heavy syrups. I got a delicious South African herbal blend with almond milk. The price was on point too. The start of the show was the honey toast. I got the strawberry ice cream with condensed milk. Absolutely amazing!!! I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys tea. As always happy hunting.,1
"Was in Vegas & came to Virgil's for lunch two days in a row!  The Memphis ribs, shrimp & banana pudding were delish. Our server Julie was phenomenal! Sweet sweet lady. If ur in Vegas, check out Virgil's.",1
Their noodles are awesommmmeeeeee!! Pot belly and triplle b are my fav! Highly recommended! I don't really give comments but their food and service really makes me so impressed!,1
"Very pleased! I've been hopping denist offices since we moved from Mesa to Chandler and have had the WORST luck. Until I got a flyer in the mail for Fountains. $25 for new patient cleaning and exam, I thought I'd give it a shot since my family was due for cleanings.I schedule cleanings for my 2 kids. We arrived at the appt and we were warmly welcomed right away. Some quick paperwork to fill out (bonus: they also have the new patient paperwork online so you can fill it out at your convenience) and then the hygenist Nicole came and took us back. She was really sweet and great with the kids.Then Dr. Ramsey examined them. My daughter had a strange looking tooth on her x ray and he really took the time to explain to me exactly what it was and what my options were. I really like this office because I feel that I was treated as if I had been going there for years and that they genuinely care about your health. Dentists are a dime a dozen, especially in the east valley. So it's nice when a practice doesn't look at you solely like you have dollar signs on your forehead. That was nice. (How sad that I'm actually so amazed at being treated like a human being at a dental practice!). Furthermore, they have a very good in house dental plan for those who don't have dental insurance. There is an enrollment fee and then you get your cleanings for $25 and 30% off other procedures. I think I've finally found a practice I will stick with!",1
First time here. So delicious. Gil's customer service was great. Very attentive and friendly. Everyone else was great too. Good quality of meat too.,1
Went in to try the veggie burger on a Saturday afternoon.  Not too busy.  The burger was great and the fries were excellent.  My son and I shared the burger/fries and we were full.  We will be back one day for breakfast.,1
"This is a fantastic, cozy yet elegant neighborhood cafe. Daniel is a master of Italian classics with a twist and has a carefully selected wine list. I loved the figs stuffed with gorgonzola and wrapped in crispy proscuttio. His dessert crepes use dulce de leche flown in from Argentina, which is a bit different from the Mexican dulce de leche. Well worth it. Will go again and again.",1
"Don't let the idea that it's in a mall and in a big chain store, this place has GREAT service and food!!!!!!!! we will be back to try every menu item",1
Love this place.  Cool vibe and everything I try tastes great.  Thankful to have one on the west side in Boca Park.,1
"Best doughnut shop on this side of town!!! Staff is very friendly, love that it's family owned :)",1
"I have lived one block from this place for 7 years and never knew it was there so what i'm saying is you could easily miss it driving by. If you do drive by it i am pleased to say this place is definately worth the U-Turn. It's also a mediteranean market so if you like trying drinks, snacks, whatever you have never had before you can also do that. We had lunch there and the food was awesome. We will be going there every week now!",1
"The atmosphere in the restaurant is so nice and pretty. The workers were extremely friendly as well! I ordered the Samseon Gan Jjajang, and I was very satisfied. There was a perfect amount of cabbage and onions to the meat and seafood I had. Definitely recommend to come here for some jjajang noodles.",1
"Went with some friends for a birthday last night, and I must say all of us enjoyed our meal.  My girlfriend and I shared the grilled artichoke and lamp chops, and we tried someone else's pasta, which was amazing.  Our server GC was very helpful, and the place was definitely a hot spot for a Friday night.  Huge wine selection with decent prices, too.",1
"I have come to this location a few times!The atmosphere is always vibrant and welcoming. I love this location. The hostess is very attentive and friendly upon arrival each time. The staff are very personable and dedicated while you are in the restaurant. I have sat at both the bar and in the restaurant portion of the location. The bar is good when you are in more of a hurry. I can't remember the bartenders name when I went, but he was very attentive and comical. The manager came out a few times just to make sure that everything was going okay during our dining experience. I bring my parents here whenever they are craving a burger and (endless) fries! I would definitely recommend this location to anyone who is craving a red robin burger or just a burger in general.FYI: I had the royal red robin burger with an egg. It was so good! However, ask for extra napkins because it can get messy, lol! Keep up the great work at this location and I will continue returning.",1
"We literally walked through ""hell"" which is Fremont Street/old Vegas, dodging beggars, gamblers anonymous, and flying garbage to this impeccably designed and refreshing coffee, foodie haven at the end of a concrete jungle.  The service is excellent.  Our order was taken by a handsome man who explained in perfect detail what an Espresso Old Fashioned is... I highly recommend.  I ordered the Golden Milk turmeric latte.  It was a balanced and delightful symphony of flavors in my mouth and went down super smooth.If you're looking for an oasis in a desert, this place is worth the drive away from the strip.  They have amazing looking pastries, breads, and foods as colorful as their staff and as fresh as their architecture.Yay!",1
"Salon Sandoval gave me a great experience!  I was in need of a blow out for a special occasion and Chris did an amazing job.  I have gone to many salons in Phoenix for blow outs and  this was one of the very best. My appointment was on time and I was attended to in a friendly , clean environment by a lovely staff. Thank you Salon Sandoval I look forward to my next visit !",1
I loved this cute little restaurant. I ordered the Le Portugais sandwich and it was perfection. Great place to grab a quick yummy bite! Would come back for sure.,1
"This is my second time staying at Caesar's Palace and I absolutely love it. Maybe it is because Vegas is just fun or the wonderlust I get looking around its beautiful interior. Who knows? Regardless, this is a top notch Vegas Strip hotel and resort! The pool is luxurious and the rooms are killer. I like the location because it puts you in the middle of the strip. You are a walk from everything you need and it is a short enough walk you can conquer it in heels!If you want a visual spectical and a perfect location, go  Roman!",1
"This is just about the best service you can get in the city, period - if you are at Cityplace, Telus not only provides incredibly fast internet speed service, the customer service and technicians are friendly, convenient and responsive.Just the best and far ahead of any other provider.",1
I had two shutters that had tilt straps that broke we were unable to locate the parts as the company went out of business. This lead us two Larry of All about blinds AZ.He knew exactly what we needed and got us the parts sent to us with no charge! What a great help thank you very much ! If we are in the market for new shutter or blinds will definitely call on Larry for purchase of new even though living in Ca. He's got our vote for best service!,1
"I have just come from Sandy Crab for the first time. The staff are fabulous, so knowledgeable about the menu. Since it was our first visit the items were explained to us and they were so friendly. I had the crab nachos unbelievable, the rest of my party had beer battered fish. I will be going back soon!",1
Tried this place today for brunch and it was really good! They have huge omelettes and the server was nice enough to tell us they have big portions so we were able to share. It looks like a family owned business and everyone was very nice and friendly. We are deff coming back!,1
"This place is great. There are 2 tacos that blow me away- the Machacha beef and the pork carnitas- so very tasty. And the tacos are jam packed with food- I'm a big eater, but 2 plus the complimentary chips and salsa is just fine.If you like real heat with flavour and you are not joking around, ask for the homemade habanero sauce. Seriously lightly dip the chip in it- don't scoop it up- it's plenty spicy but also super fruity. Such a wonderful flavour.",1
"I had the opportunity to dine at e11even while I was at a conference this summer in Toronto.  It was a lunch meeting with clients and ended up being a perfect setting to discuss business over a nice meal.  First off, their decor is right up my alley.  It's sexy, dark, and modern with clean lines throughout the restaurant.  To start off, our waiter brought over an iPAD that housed the drink menu.  Being a technology enthusiast, it was pretty cool and definitely a unique experience.  From there we jumped right in to ordering our meal.The service was solid throughout the meal.  The food was delicious and received high marks from everyone at the table.  We started off with crab cakes that were delicious.  I ordered the skirt steak salad and it was on point as well.  The meal was covered by my customers so that may have played into my overall experience.  I don't have anything negative to say about e11even.  In fact, I'll return if I'm ever back in Toronto.  However, looking back... I don't know if I would have ever paid $26 for a salad if it were coming out of my own pockets.",1
Oh my god! I cannot say enough about this place!The staff has been there a long time and incredibly friendly! They always recognize me and ask how I am when I come in! Food is EXCELLENT and vegetarian friendly options! Of all the Indian places I've tried across the nation they have the absolute BEST vegetable korma I've ever tried. I'm serious I have dreams about it!,1
"Absolutely amazing!  Lisa was able to get us in for a nail trim on a Friday afternoon- right around closing time. She was very patient with a 4 month old puppy (who was very wiggly) and so kind. I was extremely impressed with her attitude and work ethic. She cut the nails, grinded the nails, and even used a nail file to get any remaining sharp edges. The nails were shorter and completely scratch-free! Her price was also much lower than other places. The business was very clean and pretty, and Lisa is lovely. We will definitely be back!",1
"My bf and I have been to many sushi places in Summerlin and NONE come close to the service and fresh fish here! We went Thurs. Before Memorial weekend. One server and one busser. The place was full!  The server kept her cool, greeting, seating, answering the phone and taking orders. As a server from experience, I was definitely impressed! THIS IS OUR SUSHI PLACE HANDS DOWN!",1
"The only reason they're called Giant Hamburger is because Humongous Burger was just too darn long to say as you were shoving this giant burger in your mouth!  Not only did they cook the meat to perfection, the ""everything on it"" only makes it better (try the onions grilled!) Great meal and there is no question, Like Arnie, we'll be back!",1
"I went there couple weeks ago with friends.  I have Bun Bo Hue.  They have delicious food.  Servers are nice and friendly.  They are fast too.  Every time we ask them for something, they get it right a way.  I definitely will come back again :))",1
Stopped by for a quick bite at lunch and enjoyed classic Peruvian ceviche with a Pisco Sour to wash it down!  Reminded me of my trip to Peru last year...food and fond memories!,1
"My review is pretty much based on Brunch...I have also been for a cocktail (which was yum), but have only eaten at Brunch time.  Brunch was SO good.  I consider my self a brunch expert too.  The food was delicious, the coffee was served in a really unique stainless steel cup, and service was on point.  We actually sat next door at Herb Box for 15 minutes before even receiving a drink before walking to Stock and Stable.  A great spot to go with a group too.  Can't wait to go back!",1
"First of all, the service is awesome, the servers are detail oriented, it's beyond my expectation. The interior decoration is Chinese traditional style, there is even water fall on the wall. The tables and chairs remind me of the traditional hotpot place in China. All the foods are tasty, the medium spicy hotpot is not too bad, I would like to try the spicy one next time.",1
I hadn't been to Pomegranate Cafe in a while. but was really craving a Cassie latte. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw how much they had grown! I was so overwhelmed but one of the pastry chefs walked me through the menu and the yummy pastry case. She helped me find the most healthy options for my needs. She was very patient and knowledgeable. I will be sure to go back more often now!,1
"Right off the bat, I'll tell you this place is rad but hard to find. When you see an all state building pull into the parking lot and you'll see a little wooden owl- that is the entrance to this hidden Arcadia gem- that could so quickly be any one's favorite bar.This place is dark, when I think about it I remember red accent lights and a wall made of chopped wood, but it still had more of a loungey bar vibe, than a lodge ( which is what i think of when I see tons of chopped wood)Next, the bartenders are SO knowledgeable. They taught my fiance and I how to truly do a whisky flight. They also made some awesome recommendations and truly crafted a tasty, deep, quality craft cocktail- probably one of the better old fashions I have had since moving to Phoenix-metro area. They have darts, pool table, a great whisky selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff and just a cool, underground type vibe.Part of me doesn't even want to post this review, because I want to keep it my own little secret! But alas, I'll let you yelpers know so you can experience the secret coolness of this place :)Cheers, friends.",1
"Dairy Lane is probably one of my most favorite breakfast joints in Calgary! A friend of mine recommended Dairy Lane and I'm so glad he did. The food is super delicious and made from the finest local ingredients. They even have a list of all the local vendors they get their ingredients from, and the list is intensive! I had ordered the smoked salmon benedict with avocado and I was blown away with the quality of the dish let alone the presentation. One bite into my dish, and I've fallen in love! Definitely in my top 5 breakfast joints, I love it here and will be coming back very soon!!!",1
Amazing!!! It's family operated and been around for years now. Changed locations but still as good as ever!,1
"Have been happily shopping at Airpark for nearly as long as they've been open! Pricing is more than fair with a good selection of quality merchandise most of the time. Things tend to sell quickly, so buy it if you love it!  2 posters referred to AC as ""little""....it's actually quite large.  Good displays, easy to work with staff.  All things considered, AC is one of the best consignment stores in Scottsdale.",1
"7am Monday morning on a business trip and can't stop coughing. The hotel gave me a list of places and this was the closest. Great choice for me. I was a walk-in but got there before the morning rush. Waited about 20 minutes. Filled out paperwork and they got me right in. Fortunately it's just allergies and a mild virus. Got a prescription and I'm on my way. And the cabbie who took me, gave me his number and came back to get me when I was done. So nice. On to the rest of my trip.",1
"Wonderful place for children, our toddler daughter loves every inch of this park. From the petting zoo, to the easy-access exhibits, to the play areas and water features. The Phoenix Zoo is pretty expansive and has many interactive attractions including Monkey Island and the Kid's zoo area. The new orangutan habitat is pretty awesome- easy to spend time there watching them play. You have all of the traditional exhibits: lions, tigers, elephants, rhinos, monkeys, bears, cats, and birds. There's an Arizona area that contains animals indigenous to the area (reptiles and spiders for the kids!). There's plenty of benches along the walkways to stop and rest from the sun/heat. You can also visit one of the many food and drink stations located around the park. Grab a cold bottle of water, soda, or the snow cones seem to be popular in the summer time. If you're a resident, the zoo membership is worth considering. At $40 per person it's paid for after a few visits. A no brainer for families with small kids. I believe the PHX Zoo is ranked one of the Top 10 zoos for kids- and it's well deserved. The grounds are kept very clean and is typically packed with large crowds during peak times and cooler months. The zoo hosts lots of great events throughout the year- including Zoo Lights during winter months, a Halloween event, several marathons, and other fun things to do. Members receive discounts on these events.",1
Great massage! Been to plenty around town and got their $20 special and then the add on oil and hot stone for $8. Awesome service all around! We'll definitely be back!,1
"This place is super! Cute, friendly, quick service. I tried the BBQ quesadilla not wanting to exceed my expectations... Do Yummy! And the Pico, oh my... So GOOD! The liberal use of cilantro here is fantastic. I can't wait to come back and work my way through the enchiladas!",1
"Excellent pho at a tremendous value.  Some of the best Vietnamese food in the Phoenix valley.  The service is great as well, the place is typically pretty busy and they work really hard to sit and serve everyone.  Highly recommend.",1
"No problem giving this place 5 stars because the service was great, the bruschetta is a must if you are in the mood for a mouthgasm. Of course the Chicago deep dish is the star meal. It was incredible, went with the Lou. Toppings and cheeses are great. Sauce was amazing. The crust was something special, it was flaky but not too flaky, the butter they use in the description makes all the difference.",1
Love this place. Authentic thai food is hard to find. The coconut (thom ka?) soup is amazing!,1
"Holy smokes was this place good. To start with, the vibe is welcoming and upbeat. Nice coffee and juice bar when you first walk in. As our table was going to take about 15 minutes, I went ahead and ordered a couple large iced coffees. Nothing fancy about them but they were $4 a piece which I thought was a tad steep. That, however, is my only gripe. My wife and I both got the breakfast grilled cheese. It was PHENOMENAL. Eggs, hash browns, cheese and bacon on perfectly toasted bread - so good. We also got one buttermilk pancake to share with was light, airy and delicious. The total for the food was around $20 which is perfect. We will definitely be back to Breakfast Club next time we're in the area!",1
"Update- I tried their desserts.  The cinnamon fries and chocolate peanut butter hummus... and it was, BOMB!The food here is very very good.  It's worth paying more for the amounts you want.  No complaints on the quality and flavor of the food it's sooooo great!! Old review:Very good.  I would give 5 stars if They didn't skimp a little on the meat.  It's honestly a joke how little meat was added to my bowl, I could finish it in three bites and I'm not exaggerating. The second time I came back, I ordered extra meat now and pay more just to have a normal serving of meat.  But the quality and flavors are definitely a delight. The staff is friendly.  There's a nice atmosphere.",1
Fantastic new addition to Belmont! Such a cool concept and so many things on the menu I want to try. I had a beef burger that was so full of flavor. The sides I chose (sweet potato mash and cole slaw) weren't as good and I probably wouldn't order again. The desserts are fresh made from a bakery in Charlotte and you could definitely tell. So. Good. Definitely recommend this place. You won't be disappointed!,1
"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba.This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.  The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that ""punched in the stomach"" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).  I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often! P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know!(ku-doh-ba???)",1
I boarded my dogs here last weekend.  It is definitely very clean and the owner and staff are very nice.   I am very pleased with the facilities and will most definitely repeat.,1
"We arrived at midnight last Saturday and was so happy to get to our beautiful suite!  We stayed only 2 nights but had enough time to do a little gambling, go to the pool and have dinner at Lavo restaurant. Most of all I want to compliment Joe from guest services.  Joe picked up our bags from our suite on our departure date.  Joe was so personable, funny and so interesting and spoke at least 4 different languages.  We totally enjoyed talking with him and he walked us down to the lift area, made sure our ride came and helped us with our bags.  Joe was a breath of fresh air!!!",1
"Wooden Robot is my favorite brewery in Charlotte. It has a great location in South End. The space is big enough, yet feels homey vs. warehousey. I usually get the What He's Having which is an IPA. I have had a few different beers and none have disappointed. The bartenders are friendly and quick. There are some food options on site now which is cool. Dog friendly. Highly recommend Wooden Robot for some beers, some bites or a growler to go.",1
"This place is awesome. I was traveling through town on my way to my next destination and I found this little gem. The place is small so best to get it Togo but, call ahead they are busy! And rightfully so the pizza is terrific, and their not kidding with the monster slices. Thin crust and delicious. I also tried their stuffed chicken wings. Wow fantastic thin exterior of chicken stuffed with sausage and glazed with sweet and sour sauce and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Wow is all I have to say get them they won't disappoint. And to top it off the grilled rosemary lemonade. Mmmmmm a nice touch not too sweet just what the taste buds ordered to quench your thirst. Very satisfied I will be back.",1
"This place is deserving of a 5 Star review! It serves the best breakfast selections you can imagine. Chef John is a fun loving guy and has recently remodeled the place with a surfer look. It may seem that eggs bacon and hash browns are just eggs bacon and hash browns but not here! The food is cooked perfectly, the wait staff are friendly and prompt, the place is always packed but don't let that stop you. Chef John has added crepes to the menu and I couldn't resist. And while a savory crepe would be my normal choice the Vanilla Creme with Chocolate Drizzle is what I got. It was luscious, I think whole wheat flour in the crepes, rich and filling, not overly sweet, just the correct flavors of vanilla and chocolate",1
"This place is great! I was here briefly, so we just had some snacks, but everything was yummy. The charcuterie board had some local meats and cheese that really hit the spot. And of course, the beer was awesome. The store is also really cool to check out - especially if you're a tourist like me. We wanted so many things! I ended up leaving with a tin of Burning River.Definitely a fun place to check out!",1
"There are enough places to blow your money in Vegas - go to Earl of Sandwich for one of your meals and get the best bargain in town for seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had anywhere!I made sure to rush to write my review after a recent trip to Vegas because I can't rave enough about their holiday special sandwich, which is pretty much the best Thanksgiving sandwich you'll ever have anywhere (and that includes the Bobbie at Capriotti's, which is another one of my faves). The only thing is that they only offer this til January, so make sure to run over and snatch one up!Though the ingredients are what you would expect (turkey, gravy, stuffing, cranberry), i fell in love with the flavor and quality of each of them. I think the thing that makes it is the bread, which is somehow perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Believe the hype! Unlike a lot of other places in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a sure win!",1
"I lucked into this gem unplanned and was so glad glad I did--trust the hype! I arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday, which was, apparently, just the right time because there was maybe a 70 person wait when I was leaving, and I was sat at the bar and served right away. I ordered the Laab, Green Curry, and Mango sticky rice and it was easily the best Thai meal I have every eaten with enough left over for another entire meal. Do yourself a favor and stop in. It's worth whatever the wait is.",1
Good place. Wide variety of desserts. Ice cream is really good. Ice cream cookie sammy is spectacular,1
"After extensive research, I retained Zach Parry to resolve a securities fraud case filed with the largest securities dispute resolution forum in the United States.  The case was first initiated on my own and I took it as far as I could go without legal help given that the opposing party had at attorney who was an expert in securities arbitration.  Zach came to the rescue; he had a terrific educational background with a BS from Brigham Young University and a law degree from the University of Illinois.  He also had broad legal skills including handling cases in fraud litigation and arbitration.  I was very pleased how quickly he got up to speed on my case.  His case filings were excellent in representing my case and the respondents realized the best strategy was to settle the case.  Through direct negotiations he again legally supported my side on many issues and through his strong negotiating, Mr. Parry received the highest settlement I could have expected to receive.  During the process he was easy to work with always seeking my input and educating me on my options.  I highly recommend Zach Parry; he is a multi-skilled attorney as he so well demonstrated on my case.",1
"Thanks Bobby for not letting us down!  My wife and I came here for an anniversary weekend brunch.  The ambiance is really cool and open, as you'd probably expect.  The kitchen is visible through the dinning room, which I liked.  The service was professional and not forced.  We started with some wine for me, and a margarita for my wife.   Both sections were good, but I should have joined my wife with one of the signature margaritas.  As for the food, we started with Bobby's signature tamale with shrimp topped with a garlic cream sauce and garnished with fresh corn and cilantro.  It was one of the best things I have ever put into my mouth, Wow!  Got our entrees, I started with the special of the day.  It was brunch, so it was a strip steak marinated and grilled, served with pickled onion, eggs, avocado relish of sort, some kick ass southern glaze, yummy...  it was served with warm tortillas so you could make your own tacos.  My wife had the other special of the day, which was a sweet potato hash with chicken and roasted vegetables etc..  it was also really good; all the food was memorable.  We will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.",1
"Absolutely delicious.  Good selection of meal choices.  Had the chopped salad with chicken today, it was absolutely delicious and the Multigrain bread that came with it was out of this world.  Staff was friendly and eager to help.",1
"Went to see Celine's show tonight. WOW, that an outstanding performer. She draws her audience in and gets them involved. This was my 3rd time seeing Celine in Vegas perform; but 5 times total that I've attended her concerts. I highly recommend that people attend her show at least once and see what a beautiful person/singer she is.",1
I loveeeeeeee yogurt land. Come here at least once every week.  Only complaints the closing hours other than that it was great !,1
"We heard about Pizza Pit from a friend, ""its just like Harris Pizza !"" ( a Quad City Famous Pizza maker)We couldn't believe it..and were there the next day.Pictures of the QC's bridges and part of downtown Davenport on the walls. Met and spoke with both owners Matt and Corey, ordered a large sausage with much anticipation...The pizza arrived and LOOKED very familiar, tasted it and YOW ! we couldn't believe it, just like home, EXCEPT, i think it was better, something in the crust...We immediately called some friends who are originally from the QC's, ordered another pizza and took it to them, they loved it as much as we did.Looking forward to the 1st and third Sunday Quad City happy hour get together !",1
"I want to live at The Wynn. Just got back (3rd time staying at the wynn)...and I love it more each time. The guy checking us in upgraded us to the tower suites...for no reason, which was nice! The amenities are amazing. Their attention to detail is impeccable. It takes Vegas to a whole new 'non-trashy' level!",1
"I love this little restaurant.  Service was quick, Ramen was amazingly delicious...",1
We went to Citizen Public House because of the multitude of huge Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. Our waiter was so knowledgable from the cocktails to the food and wine. Amazing memory. Thanks Citizen...we will visit again when we are in town.,1
Huge thanks to Ron who assisted me every step of the way when my pool heater died. He talked with my home warranty company and went out of his way to assist me in getting a quote and arranging the purchase. Cannot thank him enough for his time and dedication to his customers. I will only use Ron and his team for my pool.,1
"To start off we made reservations and were greeted nicely and escorted to the bar to wait, order drinks, or tapas while we waited for our reservation(we were early). The bartenders were nice, down to earth, knowledgeable of the menu and eager to suggest good wines or cocktails. Despite a busy bar, they were attentive and timely. We were escorted to our table and told happy birthday on our way. We were asked if the seating was okay which is always a plus. We had a view of he fountains at the Bellagio too. We sat in comfortable chairs at adequate height and width that I did not have to readjust I the entire night. The table is laid with monogrammed dishes and decor that are simple but yet you know where you're at...Giada's duh! The waitress, Nancy, was prompt and explained the drink menu, tasting menu and regular menu to us and explained how she would suggest ordering. Not only did Nancy greet us sweetly but she was able to manage up her assistant and their menu. I'm not the biggest spicy food fan and Nancy offered to have the chef tone the spice down so I could still enjoy an item. The assistant brought us bread to go with our wine that we got at the bar and explained the different toppings to us. Oh my the BREAD and the delicious toppings! To die for. We decided on the tasting menu and it did not disappoint. The bacon wrapped dates melted in our mouths, the crostini and goat cheese peppers were delicious. Oh my goodness, an amazing start! Lemon Spaghetti and the Bucatini were superb! Fresh pastas and light but powerful flavors. We both ordered the filet medium rare, him with lobster and I with shrimp. Holy Hell!! It came with sweet potato mash and some onions with lemon potatoes and polenta served family style. Wow, it was all perfect. For dessert we got to pick from the dessert tray and my plate said Happy Birthday in chocolate. Get the Napoli! Great! Never once did we feel rushed and we always had a full glass of sparkling water. Nancy was amazing and so is Giada's. Highly satisfied and will tell all my friends.",1
This is the first dentist I am not terrified to go to! The entire staff is great and the bird sanctuary really makes you feel calm and tranquil while sitting in the chair. Bird sounds drown out the anxiety inducing sounds of drills commonly found at normal dental offices. And if that wasn't enough they offer sedation for those of us who need it.,1
"I went to Crust in the late afternoon on Father's Day. The new seating layout allows for more people in the restaurant, great idea! I have (on several different occasions, not all at once!) had the bruschetta appetizer (yum!), Greek salad, original Rustica, a Greek pizza (mozzarella, feta, green and black olives), cannolis and meatballs. Sunday I had another fav, the Filet Mignon Sliders!! So tender, perfectly cooked and sliced, the best ever! My boss said he goes there, surprised I haven't ruin into him yet....anyway, we both gave discriminating tastes and Crust is always on my go-to list! I also have the Crust card and receive text messages which is great for finding out about specials when making spontaneous plans! Love the friendly staff too!",1
"Pure delicious genius!  Flavor combinations you'll never imagine that just work, and work well!  You must eat here if you are near Fremont. If you're not near Fremont, make the trip. It's worth it!We had the Devils on Horseback, Fried MAC Croquettes and Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles. Each better than the last. Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding was decadent. We've eaten at many Vegas high end venues and Therapy can compete with any of them.Our server, Jonathan was personable and knowledgeable. Great job!",1
"Wonderful neighborhood spot!! Great service and so much to choose from on the menu.  Nothing can beat a truly cold beer and a mac 'n cheese burger.  Sounds weird, I know.... but definitely exceeded my expectations!! It is a MUST TRY!!! Friendly staff and just an overall nice place to relax and grab a bite to eat.  Can't wait to go back.... and will definitely become a ""regular"".",1
"I received a gift certificate for a 1 hour therapeutic massage from work and made an appointment online. It was super easy selecting the time and person I wanted that was available. I made an appointment for 9am and was the first one there since that's when it opens per the times on the door (online it did say an appointment was open for 8:30am so not sure if they are willing to open earlier or not). I walked in and the quietness in their was so beyond soothing. I've never experienced such a quiet environment. I checked in and sat in the comfy cloud like chairs until called back. Cecilia is who I chose for my massage and she was amazing. So much so that I ended up deciding, in my mind-10 minutes in, that I was going to get a membership. She listened to what I was needing and was able to address them. The massage was great and I can't wait to keep going back to get all the knots smoothed out.The only thing I'd say they need to fix is their pamphlets with prices. Member price for a massage membership was $39.99 and when I got my membership the girl scratched that off and said it's been changed to $45. I'd also change the words inside the picture frames that are on the shelves, looked tacky and cheap.",1
"My first experience here, all i can say is ""Man was it fun!!"" It was on my bucketlist to go to a karaoke place, but hard to find one thats 18+. Luckly i found this one and had loads of fun! I made a reservation for Me, my boyfriend, and two cousins, my boyfriend wasn't to excited for the most part cause he's not much of a singer, but little me had to drag him x). we got the small room, the room rate was reasonable, cause you can just split the bill between your party. The room was amazingly great, with the lazer lighting, it sets off a really cool vibe and you can sing as loud as you want and you will hardly hear from outside the room. I asked the employee at yhe front desk if he could us singing and he replied ""very little."" I thought this was good cause we were going all out with the singing, im talking about trying to hit those high notes on some songs. Me and my two cousins were enjoying all the fun with the karaoke machine while my boyfriend was trying to be mr. cool guy and not joy. However, we managed to find his favorite artist on the the machine and we just had to put the song on for him, and surprisingly he SANG!!! All and all it was a really great experience and since this place in literally near my apartment, lets just say all my paycheck may go towards August Karaoke Box haha... The main this that caught my attention to this place is:-The staff are very friendly and helpful-The atmospher of the place was great-The Karaoke Machine easily functional-They serve foodThis plac is worth it!!",1
One recent Thursday both my wife's & my iPhones continuing odd behavior required us to to something after many weeks of frustration. We had earlier made an appointment at an Apple Store but left without obtaining a solution. By the following Saturday my phone was dead. (It figures because we just paid each off via the AT&T installment plan.) So we then visited 2 AT&T stores. The idea was to simply get new iPhones. The 1st store offered poor customer service and the associate claimed she couldn't (wouldn't?) call another store to see if the desired models were in stock. It should be noted that one can call another Macy's or Big 5 for that matter to find a properly sized pair of shoes. But she couldn't find a pair of phones with her access and use of modern technology? The 2nd AT&T store we visited  was too crowded to get timely service. Ultimately we found our way to the Gadget Experts later that day. We were welcomed and greeted by Eduardo and then Justin. The latter examined our phones. He advised us it appeared to be battery related issues affecting each phone. It should also be noted that the earlier visit to the Apple Store offered replacement batteries for TWICE the cost as offered by the Gadget Experts.We purchased the batteries at the Gadget Experts. Justin installed them for us. This experience was positive all the way around. It also produced cost-saving & effective results. We highly commend & recommend the Gadget Experts before going to an Apple Store or any AT&T stores. The quality of the service is second only to the professionalism of both Eduardo & Justin who were also very cordial which was both refreshing and appreciated. Excellent!!!,1
"Simplement un des meilleurs restaurants à déjeuner de la région. Prix et nourriture sont excellents. Ici les pommes de terre et le bacon ne dégoulinent pas d'huile. Tout y est savoureux, même le café. On essaie par curiosité mais y on retourne en habitué.",1
"Love Lish nail salon and the new owners.   I highly recommend trying them out.  CLEAN, professional, tons of colors to pick from, great atmosphere, super friendly.   Love that I have my own set of nail clippers and files in my own box they keep here for me and they use new plastic liners in the pedicure tubs every time.  No hidden costs.  They list what you get for how much you pick.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!!!",1
"Love the sushi here. Always great, and affordable. Friendly atmosphere. I always stop when I'm on this side of Pittsburgh!",1
"I came in for a simple repair on a longboard given to me . I walked out with a NEW BOARD , Why ? Because Tim and Sam are Awesome . Their board selection is Vast with a beautiful selection of boards .I couldnt resist purchasing another . They repaired my old board free of charge before knowing I would buy a new one . Sam gave me info on places with cool hills . He actually came out of the store to my vehicle to show me where the paths were . Thank you both for your incredible professionalism",1
"Came here back in June, we had a reservation, but still waited a little while. Needless to say, it was well worth the wait! You really cannot get Beef Wellington like this at any other steakhouse that I have been too. This is what Gordon is known for, absolutely special and worth any wait. The service was impeccable and the restaurant was very cool. A wonderful meal and a can't miss when in Vegas.",1
My second child is getting braces here now and all I can say is LOVE THIS PLACE!!! My sons braces straightened his very crooked front top teeth almost over night!,1
"Four of us had the prime rib dinner special last Sunday.  The prime rib was excellent, we are beef snobs as we grew up on home-raised beef and this was cooked perfectly with good seasonings.  The salads were all good, two had the Caesar and loved it. The sides were all very tasty with large portions for the sautéed mushrooms, the twice baked potato and the au gratin potatoes, we took home doggie bags. Same with dessert, the butter cake was very flavorful and the creme brûlée was finished at the table by burning the sugar atop and it too was excellent.  Service was attentive.  An excellent dining experience.",1
Wow! I got a bag to go & enjoyed the milk cakes. So different from anything I have ever had. I love sweets and so glad we discovered this place. Very friendly services and customers told me things to try:) very happy we came! So good! My parents also enjoyed as well!,1
They always have the best prices and deals for medical card holders. Thank you Rey Rey for always taking good care of medical card patients!,1
"Lazy Dogs is a welcome restaurant and bar from all the other run of the mill restaurants! Located in Downtown Summerlin (DTS as our son says!) it sits in the shadows of the Red Rock Casino and 5 minute walk from the Aviators ballpark and the Knights training arena and the Arsenal arena.It has a really laid back vibe and all the waiters and bartenders are in flannel shirts. Probably not to comfortable in the summer though.The entire staff is friendly, even in flannel, and very quick as they scurry around the restaurant. Walk ins are welcome in the bar area, but you'll have to wait to be seated in the restaurant tables or booths.They have an awesome outside patio area where all shapes and sizes of dogs are welcome. The patio is centered around a massive fire pit that keeps customers warm, as well as propane heated lamps around the area too.The food is excellent! Had a birthday celebratory rib-eye steak, the other choice was a flat iron steak, and I have to admit it was the best steak I've ever had in town! For a smaller restaurant not particularly know for putting out steaks, they found their little niche'. I haven't been to the bigger, more expensive steak places in Vegas because of the prices and the restaurant atmosphere is to stuffy for me. I'm sure they are better steaks out there. But Lazy Dogs is a very casual, come as you are, they don't judge...... and relax in a nice atmosphere.They are not a 24 hour place though. Great happy hours specials and free apps or desserts for birthdays. TV's around the bar so you can watch various sports.",1
"Vegenation takes traditional non-vegan foods and makes them vegan, like cheesy eggplant stacks, hot wings, and pizza. never tastes bland like many vegan places!! CELIAC TIP:  waitresses/waiters vary in thoroughness when trying to lower the chance of cross contamination, so along with explaining your needs to them, also make sure any gluten free pizzas are put in the oven ontop of foil or in a pan, and make sure the wings arent fried! They are still good without being fried :)",1
"I love this place, Ive had the last 5 birthday dinners here, as well as always come in with friends frequently. One of the hostess' was very rude on the phone, I spoke to the manager Steve and he made sure to make things right when I came in for my birthday. Our server, Landiss was amazing, was super interactive, gave us his full attention ( even on a weekend) I felt like we were the only ones in the place. He went above and beyond to make sure we had a great dining experience. The manager also came over to check on us and make sure we were doing well a few times, great customer service and a very nice guy! Plenty of good choices for vegetarians as well :) I loved their Cesar salad which I split with my friend as well as their pasta dish (the one with the mushrooms, brussels sprouts, squash). I was also given a nice card for my birthday as well as not one but 2 desserts of my choice! WOW! I was impressed and were even considering having our wedding reception dinner here.",1
"First time coming here to this location. Krystle our bartender was really sweet and nice she took our food order after out order come out we noticed it was all wrong we told Krystle about it and she noticed it too. She went to the Kitchen to tell the cook.the cook had a  attitude problem when she was trying to fix our food order but she keep her cool and  took care of it. To me that's taking care of the customer after all of this was going down i told myself wow this will be my first and last time coming, but when Krystle went above and beyond to take careful of us she just gained a new customer. I will be coming buck here because i know she will take care of us. Thank you Krystle your so sweet for doing all of this Now the cook Needs to  except responsibility for messing up a food order and try not to blame it on someone else..",1
"Great new restaurant in Boca Park. Wonderful atmosphere, great service, and a good value. Both of our fresh market creations were excellent. It is a nice twist on the old Mongolian BBQ concept. The sauces they have to choose from were very tasty. Try combining the spicy sweat chili sauce with the peanut sauce. Gives the dish a Thai like flavor. The ginger soy sauce was also very good. Plenty of fresh ingredients to choose from. The staff was very helpful in creating a unique dish for you. Will definitely go back.",1
"a homemade waffle joint down the street from my house???i must be the luckiest girl in the world!there are many items on the menu but the best item is the BYOW (build your own waffle).your choice of waffle type and toppings.that's all me, man!i got the organic flax waffle with strawberries, bananas and mangoes.the waffle was perfectly cooked - a nice crunch on the outside and super fluffy on the inside.the fruit was so fresh and perfectly ripe.didn't even need any syrup!the hubby got the breakfast sammich.it must've been good because, before i knew it, it was gone.the service was great.you can tell it's a family owned and run business.those are the best in my book.sure, it might be nice to be able to eat these amazing waffles on real dinnerware with real flatware but the paper and plastic products certainly won't keep me from gettin my WaffleS on!",1
"Wow. We stopped in last night for an appetizer and a glass of wine before dinner. Great ambiance. Cozy and quiet. Service was excellence (Lucas I believe). Prompt, thorough, unobtrusive. Wine was reasonably priced and tasted great (we ordered by the glass). We ordered the brussel sprouts and roasted carrots. Perfectly prepared and presented. Delicious. Will definitely return.",1
"I am very happy to have Commonplace Coffee at Smallman Galley! I've been drinking their coffee since they opened their first shop in Indiana, PA (now they have 4 spots in PGH) and they've never failed to have great coffee and specials. The spot at Smallman Galley might be my favorite because it's a great spot to work in the morning. Low-key and chill. There are outlets at the bar and larger tables for hangs/meetings. There are pastries to eat in the morning, and it's good spot to meet for lunch, as all the restaurants open at 11 am and everyone can chose what they like. Also, it's a really cool spot to take visitors as the concept is unique but casual. Downside is Strip District parking but whatever.Most relaxed coffee spot in the Strip!",1
"Easily the best meal of our recent Vegas trip- and we dined at several other places that were much more expensive. Stumbled on Gordon Ramsays location here at Cesears one hungry afternoon. Seated right away and ordered two beers. Drinks served promptly by our server who was very professional the entire way through our meal. We shared the sliders, mac and cheese and mixed veges (brussel sprouts and carrots). Sliders were great- cooked medium with cheese and bacon. Very tasty. Mac and cheese was excellent with several cheeses and duck fat croutons. The veges, believe it or not were outstanding. Mini brussels and carrots sautéed and seasoned perfectly. Service was quick and professional. Prices were high but on par with what you got and Vegas in general. No complaints here! Will definitely return.",1
"From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed by very friendly staff, we chose tepanyaki dinner and it was very good, the chef did just what we ordered and even made extra sauce for us on the side! Entertaining and good food! Also the brought us refills without us asking which I love! Will def go back!",1
"Stopped in for breakfast. I ordered the central park, a simple bacon and eggs breakfast. What I got was something that was prepared with pride and attention to detail. Seasoned breakfast potatoes, crispy, bacon, sourdough toast that was not from the local grocer, perfectly cooked eggs and coffee that was not brown water but not so strong that I'll be up for days. The price was really fair.",1
"Mr. D's has a lot going on all the time.  Bikini and Lingerie-clad Bartenders, Karaoke, Car Night, Bike Night, Live Music, Food Specials, and much more.Did I mention bikini bartenders?  They are very friendly, efficient, and easy on the eyes.The food is well prepared and reasonably priced.Lots of TVs and plenty of seating.  They have most of the sports packages too.You can review the other posts for more detail but the bottom line is that there is something for everyone with a great mix of clientele, young and old.",1
"I had the pleasure of staying here for my birthday wknd and I must say: SIMPLY AMAZING. I'm not going to go into detail about the beautiful chandelier and the funky artsy stuff that you see as you're walking to the Wicked Spoon (the awesome buffet restaurant)... I think all the reviews on here have pretty much covered it all.I will just say that the Cosmopolitan has THE most amazing bed and pillows. If you don't come to Vegas to sleep at all, then don't waste your time here. I WANTED to sleep the whole time and just order room service so I can lie in on their delicious bed! This place also has the secret hole-in-the-wall pizza joint behind STK. Best pizza I've had, aside from NYC, hands down.",1
"This is a great school! It's the fourth school my wife and I have tried and it is at the top of our list. The teachers are very involved. The front office staff is exceptional and attentive to parents needs. My wife and I couldn't have asked for anything better. My son is four and has been going here since the beginning of the year and he loves it. If your looking for a great preschool/childcare program, I would highly recommend this facility. Great job and keep being a great example in our community! Awesome!",1
"I can't thank Bucci's enough.  It's a great place for a group to gather....they are ALWAYS accommodating.  The owner treats everyone special and obviously trains her staff to do likewise. I originally booked a reservation for 12 but had to change it to 20 the day of, and no one batted an eye!Half our group were under 16 so we ordered three pizzas (MUST try the white), and almost  all the appetizers. wings- FAB, mozzarella fritta, hot peppers, chicken tenders  ALL GREAT.If you are looking for a family owned business with good Italian food, and GREAT service, look no further.....",1
My wife and I volunteered for a great cause. Feed my starving children prepares packaged meals for for children in under developed countries throughout the world. This is our third time doing this and it makes us feel good knowing we're helping those who don't have the ability to help themselves,1
"Some great bbq can be found here.  Get it while it's still available, otherwise you'll be missing out.  Unfortunately they ran out of fatty brisket and sausage when I arrived.  However, I was able to get some:ribs - juicy and tasty, though a little salty at the edges for melean brisket - good with a little bit of fat at the edge for a balance.  the sauce helpedpulled pork - this was juicy, tasty and full of texurethe cheese grits and cole slaw were good as welllmb sauces, regular sauce was good, the spicy one was even better, not too spicy either",1
Been here several times and the chocolate covered macaroons are amazing. Also LOVED the salted chocolate cookie- perfect combo of favors!,1
Was a little reluctant to go in for dinner since his specialty is cakes. I was pleasantly surprised. The scallops were amazing and so was the pasta. Topping off the great dinner and wine was the great service from our server,1
"I panicked when my garbage disposal died and water wasn't draining. I asked on Facebook for a plumber recommendation and immediately Paula came to the rescue! I ended up calling Alex and he was so nice. He tried walking me through it over the phone to see if I could fix it, but it was as too far gone. I LOVED that they offered this. I knew right then that this company wasn't just out for my money. The very next morning Alex came by. Super friendly, caring and clean. He had fresh little booties to place over his shoes to keep the floors clean. Greeted me with a smile and his business card. He fixed my sink and got me an even more powerful disposal. He was even nice enough to disconnect and disassemble my RO (per my request) AND fixed my toilet problem!! All in one visit! This meant the world to me and lifted a ton of weight off my shoulders. Cleaned up everything he did perfectly and showed me how to use everything. Offered to come back if any problems. He took precise care to his work so that the outcome was perfect. Did I mention how nice and caring he was? Thank you guys SOOO much. You will be the first and only plumbing company I will use.",1
"I come here every morning and regardless of the day I'm having, Tina and Amber and their staff always greet me with a smile on their face and treat me like family. It feels like my version of a Cheers bar and I truly enjoy going in every morning to say hi to the girls!! It's such a great way to start my day and they always know my order and have it ready. They're the best and really amazing people. Love Tina!!!",1
I stayed here for two months & the staff is great! They really try to meet your needs. The rooms & pillows are comfy. Housekeeping is thorough. They touch up daily & full clean once a week. Worth the money to stay here & the hotel is close to a really charming downtown area.,1
"We were looking for something fun AND economical to do on our last day in Madison. The Fella found a couple museums that are free and, boom! Day planned!Based on the hours of our intended stops for the day, we decided to start our day at the Chazen. And I was not disappointed by our visit! I enjoyed it immensely.The Chazen is fairly large. Two buildings connected by an enclosed bridge on an upper floor. The museum is wonderful! It is bigger than expected, and they offer a broad variety of styles and art types. There is certainly a little something for everyone!It is pointless to overview the exhibits because they change. But I can say there was a fabulous variety of classical art, landscapes and still lifes, and my super absolute favorites...weird, bold, funny, large-scale contemporary art!My favorite exhibit was the contemporary glass and sculpture exhibit on the top floor of the second building. There were certainly some interesting things to see up there (for reference, see the photo of the deer making out, the weird two-headed crying baby thing, etc.). My boyfriend was hesitant about going up there because he ""hates sculpture,"" his least favorite art form he says. But he walked up there was thoroughly tickled pink by some of the silly and weird stuff up there. There was also a special exhibit called ""Derriere"" which featured corresponding back- and butt-prints of people. A study on the body during rest. I dunno...it was cheeky (pun 50% intended). :-)I really loved this museum! The variety made it more enjoyable for a broader audience (my friend likes the more classical/normal stuff). It is pretty big, you can speed though or take your time, but a few hours would probably be the average time to get through the art.Either way...no matter what...if you can, get yourself here and getcha some culture!!",1
"Hux is amazing, it's made my life so much easier. They're really convenient and do an incredible job. 5 stars!!",1
"Love this place, you never know who you will be sitting to.  Lots of Rosedale ladies sitting along side boys from the village.  The salon is not the fanciest, it's clean and well stocked.The technicians attack my feet with enthusiasm, I never have a compliant.  If you want a luxury day at a spa this is not for you.  If you want a great pedicure in a clean salon, this is it.  I highly recommend.",1
"This gem is in MT Lebanon. It's the original Atria's. Lots of interesting history and delicious menu. Very quaint bar area which offers daily happy hour with half off drinks and appetizers. The pot roast nachos are my favorite. I've sampled just about everything on the menu and it is all delicious. My company's Christmas party was there last year and it was a hit. Great service, atmosphere, food and drinks. Highly recommend.",1
"I met a lovely, professional gentleman at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas (who approached me and worked there and asked me how my visit was A+ to you sir), he suggested I try Momofuku for a nice little snack. Originally thought this was a sushi restaurant. I approached the hostesses and asked what kind of food it was and they responded with ""do you want to see the menu"" which, I definitely did, but would have been delighted if they gave me a few words on their style of dining. They sat me immediately at the bar, and the bartender was super engaging. He asked me what kind of food I was interested in getting and I said vegetarian. He provided me with options, and was very detailed in his descriptions. I had a mushroom bun, a bizarre but tasty spicy almond cucumber appetizer (that he suggested) and the chick pea ramen. All of which were wonderful. The bartender accidentally gave me a bun instead of the cucumber appetizer but was very quick to correct his mistake. Apologized, and comped it. I was impressed and plan to come back very soon !",1
"Quality products at a great price!  I love my newly embroidered collared shirts and denim buttoned-down shirt.  Our company logo looks great!  Now, when I'm out working, I can feel comfortable, too.  Thanks, Alice!",1
Love coffee tree!! My dad visited before they were voted best in the Burg (4 time by the way). He called it the best cappuccino since he visited Italy. We love going there to chat or me alone to do school work. They have a lot of options and are happy to help you create drinks. You should definitely try them out!!,1
"Freakin awesome food and great prices, stopped by while walking down the strip, pleasantly surprised by awesome food and good prices",1
"I found out about this place through my friend and was skeptical about their flavors at first. But it's honestly worth trying, you'll be surprised at how good their flavors are. Personally, I like their peanut butter gelato, it's smooth and creamy, and not too sweet. Although the parking can be an inconvenience, the great, friendly staff and amazing flavors make up for it! I have already taken my family here and they loved it. I'd definitely recommend this place to more friends and family.",1
"Absolutely my favorite place to eat!!!  I love the variety of the 45' long salad bar and definitely take advantage of the choices when making my very large salads to eat.  Then you have the additional options to eat soups (the cream of mushroom is my favorite), pasta bar, potato/sweet potato bar, breads/pizzas, dessert bar, and drinks(love the fresh made teas).An added, really nice touch is that for a salad buffet, the manager often goes around and greets customers, asks how they are enjoying their meals, and often personally serves a cookie to each person he greets.  The employees are always cheerful and smiling. They continually clear your plates and clean the tables.Though this is ""just"" a buffet, we always try to leave a small tip because they go out of their way to take care of you even though there isn't the same kind if demand as from a full service restaurant server, I usually am better treated here than other restaurants where I expect it!!It's great to have a salad bar when salad bars are in limited supply!!!",1
I love this place. Just avoid lunch time during the school year as it will be very busy. Very delicious. You won't be disappointed.,1
Had my first Mickie's pizza a couple weeks ago and I've been back multiple times since then. Deep dish is to die for and is super filling. Tried the meat king as well as the Texas hold em both are bomb. Competitive pricing for superior pizza!,1
"Impressed by hassle free returns, and the pair of loafers I scored for a song.",1
"Had the breakfast burrito and a piece of the BBQ chicken pizza.  I definitely recommend the BBQ chicken pizza.  Great customer service.  It was busy, but the food was brought out quickly and with a smile.",1
Have your ever had pho in Charlotte if you didn't go to Pho Hoa tho? This is one of the most authentic Vietnamese restaurants you can go to in Charlotte. The food is well seasoned and served hot! My personal favorite dish here is the Bun Thit Nuong. This restaurant is pretty generous with meat for this dish.You should try:Bun Thit NuongBun Bo HueChi Gio,1
"Truly one of the best shows I've seen!  I rarely take the time to rate as many shows as I should, but this one I just had to!  All 5 guys were amazing & super talented acapella singers, they all have great voices!!  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute!  If I had any complaints, it's that I wished it lasted longer!  I could listen to them sing for hours!  As soon as I have some extra cash, I'll be buying their albums!!!  The show was extremely entertaining... and it doesn't hurt that Josh is super sexy!!  Well Heath is pretty cute too lol... hell all of the guys are good looking, but Josh is my fave!  His voice is phenomenal and he's hot... perfect combo! lolI can't wait to see this show again & will tell everyone I can they need to see it!  Really awesome, entertaining show from start to the amazing finish!  If you like music, this is a must see!",1
"Great cut by a friendly barber. Feel bad I don't remember the guys name, but I'll definitely go back.",1
Great experience! We were greeted quickly and escorted to our seats. David H.  was our waiter and he was very hosptiable. He made sure our drinks were always full and kept the fries coming as an appetizer. Entrees came within 5-10 minutes. Had the siracha burger and unlimited fries. Will definetly dine here again.,1
"March 3, 2019.To beat the weekend crowd, we got in a little after 8am. The waiting area started to fill up by the time we left which was a little before 9am.My order:He's not my grandpa, but ""Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice"" with marinated shredded chicken, wrapped omelette style & garnished with green onions is super ""masarap"" (delicious)! Now I know why it's a local favorite. And being a Las Vegas local, it's now one of my favorites, too!Our orders:Short- stack Red Velvet pancakes, short-stack Orange Creamsicle pancakes, and short-stack Banana Fosters pancakes.Unless you're super hungry, be prepared to box your leftovers!",1
This is an excellent  urgent care facility  I waited about 8 minutes  the staff  was efficient  and  very kind  .  It was clean and the Dr  listened patiently then prescribed meds. Just wonderful  service  they even take adult medicade.,1
"I recently saw Dr. Sarah Ryan at the Tenaya office, and she was friendly and professional. She has an amiable personality and tries to make patients feel comfortable/at ease. She also welcomes a collaborative doctor-patient relationship, which is important to me. I was given ample time during my visit and felt I received an appropriate level of care. The staff were pleasant as well. My experience with Urology Specialists of Nevada was a positive one.",1
This place was amazing. Our waitress was great and on the ball. The bread they give you is amazing. We got the duck confit for an appetizer as well as a cheese plate. Both very good. My beet salad was fresh. My husband got the steak and fries and I had the lamb. I would come back here for sure!,1
"Absolutely one of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time. Wait staff attentive and pleasant, Sierra was awesome! The food was lightening fast and very very good! I had the barbecue platter and the meat melted in my mouth! The drinks were reasonably priced and very tasty! I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for excellence.",1
"You never forget your first, right? I won't be forgetting my first Poke Bowl anytime soon! We came to To See Roll because of the name cognition and convenience (my parents live 5 minutes down Rainbow Road).  First off- when we came to visit my folks for Thanksgiving- where on earth did all these Poke restaurants pop out of?!?! I counted nearly 5 restaurants on Rainbow Boulevard alone between their house and here.  Wow- must be some high demand and heavy competition!Nonetheless, To See Roll was pretty memorable. We each got a poke bowl- my husband ordered a combination (he subbed out salad for rice base) and I got a custom build-your-own. The fish was delish- very fresh. The sauces were also yummy. I liked the pour-your-own miso soup station; we even got a few refills. Overall, I can't wait to try other spots and see how they compare.  Thanks To See Roll- you've made me a true believer in Poke Bowls!",1
"This is my 3rd visit in 3 days every night with different colleagues and a different dish. The service has been fast, professional and each dish has been very well prepared. Cobb Salad, Pecan Cranberry Salad and Ribs and Shrimp. Rickard's Red is my favorite beer while in Montreal.",1
"I showed up on a Tuesday night without a reservation, unbeknownst to me this is one of their busiest days due to their all you can eat tacos and margaritas for $24. Ari greeted us and was a delight but informed us of an hour and a half weight. She took our information and we walked off to the side to discuss our options and before we could come to a conclusion she came over and informed us that a reservation had canceled and she was able to get us in right way. She was fantastic! The great service didn't stop there however! Star was our waitress and I can't sing enough praise! She informed us of the the taco Tuesday special and without any needed persuasion we found ourselves indulging in all you can eat tacos and margaritas! There was never a moment I found myself wanting... She was extremely attentive and made sure we always had food to eat and tequila to consume. This was my first time here and it will most certainly not be my last. Thank you Ari & Star!!! It is a testament to the service when I created a yelp account just to place this review.",1
Dr. Treon and his staff are wonderful! Dr. Treon and his staff make you feel welcomed and comfortable. They went over all the concerns they had with my teeth along with a solution and made sure all my questions where answered. I had a root scaling and tooth cleaning and they did a fantastic job.,1
Superb.   Very fresh sushi.    Great flavors  Portions could have been larger for the prices.    Lobster salad roll and Myers Park roll.  I will eat here again.,1
"Definitely my favorite shop in town but that's only because they have my favorite ""bud tender"" in the city DARA!! She super knowledgable about everything green related. I have a few bad medical problems and she has even done computer research to help me get the perfect prescription for what ails me. Check it out ask for Dara, you won't be disappointed in the location, the staff or the product!",1
"Holy $h!t !!!!!!! Sweet mama that's good!! I still can't get over the coma inducing pleasurable aliment!!! Burger Bar sure knows how to win a girl and boys heart!!! Not only can you order your burgers like a drink ""just the way you like it"" but you can do the same with their sides.  My buffalo burger was just the best chunk of meat hidden between two fluffy bun pillows I've ever eaten!  The sweet potatoe fries were freaking just titillating!!! OMG....YUM!The drinks weren't all that great but who the hell cares! The food is vain and requires all of the attention, ANYWAY!!!",1
Very amazing dinner and friendly service. Server's name is Nagela - we had a great conversation and the service was wonderful. Lovely atmosphere in a fun part of DT Cleveland,1
"Grab a pamphlet, pick something that sounds good. You can't go wrong with any of the single origin coffees. The employees are very knowledgeable.",1
My daughter and I both recently had our wisdom teeth removed at First Choice on Park St. We had an awesome experience. We received great care and had no issues following our procedures. The staff is friendly and worked with our insurance company to get us a quote in a timely manner. The day of the procedure they put us at ease and made sure we had everything we needed. The appointment started on time and everything went smoothly. I have a lot of anxiety around dental work and I could not have asked for better folks to work with.,1
"First time here...Good fried chicken, mac & cheese and yams! Loved the sweet tea! Will definitely be back!",1
The food here was AMAZING! You can literally taste the freshness in the food. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant if you are looking for fresh and healthy Mediterranean food. This is my new Sunday lunch spot.,1
"Often crowded, and for good reason - fresh ingredients and hearty portions at great prices. The servers are all friendly, helpful, and easy to get along with.Their menu isn't as expansive as other Mexican restaurants, but their quality beats quantity. Fajitas come out sizzling, the meat is tender and juicy, and vegetables are cooked to just the right level of crispiness. Great place to relax and hang out.",1
I went to this location to upgrade my phone on a Friday after work.   I was greeted  right away and after 20 to 30 minutes Ms. Jaime help me out.  She took the time to explain every detail about the new phone and contract.  Thank you so much.  Keep up the good work.   Handling customer service is not easy I should know.,1
"We had the most wonderful dinner at this restaurant, everything we ordered was fabulous....!!!! The owner and his family are super, never had as great a time for an evening out.... My birthday was so much more enjoyable because of their hospitality and excellent cuisine.... The baklava chocolate cheese cake with vanilla cream mousse is heavenly.... They made me a cheesecake lover.... We will return many times, it is now our #1 restaurant in the valley....  There are so many items on their menu we are going to try.... You won't just sit and have a meal, you will be entertained with humor and enjoy the most excellent dining experience of a life time..... We'll be back next week so many great foods to enjoy, remember my teramousalata .... Dott.... We loved Greektown....!!!!",1
"Very impressed by the commitment to quality.  Burgers and fries are very good but the souvlaki salad blew away some greek restaurant salads.  Fresh romaine, grape tomatoes and real feta plus red onions.  No skimping here for sure.  I posted a photo of the souvlaki dinner I had today.  Looked great right in the container just like the photo.  Never had a bad meal there yet and I have been at least 8 times.  Impressive quality plus very pleasant staff.",1
"My first time in Vegas I stayed at the Venetian--it will be hard to top. This hotel is beautiful, inside and outside. The rooms, as everyone has mentioned, are huge and perfect for big groups. The lobby is gorgeous. The restaurants are great, either for lunch or a late-night snack (I think there is one place in the hotel that is open all night). The casino is like a maze, which is smart on their part--if I can't find my way out, I might as well gamble more! The canals and gondolas are amazing...just like Venice but without the smell. I loved the pools too, especially the smaller one that has a more Italian look to it. It also has the largest hot tub I have ever seen in my life.The staff is very helpful and brought us everything we needed (I forgot my toothbrush--oops), plus carried our luggage (girls pack way too much for Vegas). I guess that's pretty standard hotel service, but it added to the great experience for sure.It's a very classy place, but not so classy that you feel bad getting drunk and stumbling around. It's a bit expensive, but we found a good deal online, so keep your eyes peeled for those.Just writing this review is making me want to go back...",1
Awesome service. A little pricy to have them wash and fold but it just depends how valuable your time is to you.  For me it serviced a purpose,1
"Happy Valley Animal Hospital has taken great care of our senior dog for a couple of years now. Everyone there has always been helpful, accommodating and knowledgeable. Highly recommended!",1
"I purchased business cards and invoices for my stucco company at Happy Printers. In this case, I'm extremely happy we chose Happy Printing! They are locally owned and operated.  You deal directly with the friendly and professional owner Linda. She walks you through the entire ordering process and keeps you in the loop as to the status of your order. Her shop is adorable and offers office supplies for sale. When you walk into her shop you feel at home.  Linda made recommendations as to what type of cards, color, font and verbiage would work best and  she went the extra mile in assisting me. In the end, my final product was perfect and completed in a timely manner. I enjoy referring friends and family to her and feel confident they will be in good hands at Happy Printers!",1
"This buffet is the father of all buffets.  You can get as much beer/wine as you'd like?!  I was amazed!!!  Unlimited alcohol NICEEEE! Next time I'm on my way to Vegas, I'm definitely making a stop here again!  They also have a gelato/ice cream bar! Perfect for a sweet tooth like me! They've got curry, bbq, other various asian foods. FRESH SEAFOOD.  It doesn't compare to anywhere else.  The quality's top-notch.  The staff is attentive and the buffet room is so large, roomy, and clean! I love this buffet!",1
"If there is a job out there that involves walking around the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens and just commenting on how nice everything is, get ready for my application.  This place is nuts.First, let me say that it's EXPENSIVE.  $15 to get in the door.  But, it was $15 well spent so the expensiveness didn't even stand out to me.  I've blown a lot more on crappy movies that leave me unsatisfied.  We were in there for at least two hours, and there were so many things to experience here beyond the usual bo-garden experience of room after room of obnoxiously beautiful plant life.  There were plants to smell, birds to touch and let walk on you, children's gardens to play in, living butterfly exhibits to feel like a child again in.  Hanging out here, I really had FUN.  Even just looking, there was so much--bonsais, edible plants, cacti, a French garden, etc.The gift shop is also nice and affordable.  Creative, unique stuff.Free parking in a certain part of the lot is available for patrons, which is just plain kind.",1
"Coldest beer possible, beautiful bartenders & delicious food! It's a must when in Vegas",1
"This place was great. I  messaged her on Yelp and she promptly responded. She was able to get me in quick. The massage was great, very relaxing. It was very affordable as well. Couldn't ask for anything else.",1
"Had a great hot pepper pizza. Went with my Italian girlfriend and mother, they said it's their favorite place to eat their native food & they ""are always here"". Service was good, had enough food for leftover lunch tomorrow. Good atmosphere!",1
I've finally tried the sushi burrito and I love it. Their selection is very wide and the staff is very nice. Love the food.,1
Absolutely love this place. It's a nice little hidden gem. It's a Small to medium sized restaurant with a fusion of Vietnamese / American bar food?  All I know is it's delicious. Make sure to try one of their Banh Mi sandwiches and fries. They're to die for. Can't say I'm a huge craft beer guy but what I had was good. The service is decent and pretty fast.,1
"It's a seasonal landmark for different events and activities. Winter - skating Spring/ Summer - water show (uploaded a photo) lots of people walking and sitting around chatting while eating street meat, sometimes you get shows and promo stuff going on. Fall - Nuit Blanche It's always fun to walk by and see who's around city hall :)",1
"My mom and I have been going to Diane for years now. She does a color and cut for my mom (maybe layering and other things - I'm not sure) and she has helped me when I have any hair crisis. She has also thinned, layered, colored, and cut my hair throughout the years. For me, it is hard to find someone who can do my hair without messing it up since I am Asian. Her 37 years of experience really shows and I would highly recommend her. She also makes scheduling extremely easy and spends time making sure she understands what you want.",1
"So I had a Thai tea boba the first time. That mug hurt my stomach because I'm lactose intolerant. My fault I get it! It was still bomb bomb. I loved it! We came again for a Sunday evening dessert. I didn't wanna get ruined again so I decided to risk it for the biscuit and got an almond milk thai tea boba. The wifey told me it was gonna be gross, juke, it was just as good! Haven't had a bad drink here. Get everything!",1
"What a gem! Finally got a chance to check this spot out and I'm so glad I did! There are so many options that's all sound amazing, and so it was really hard for us to decide on what to have! I shared 4 dishes here with a friend and each of them was a hit. We ordered the Tako Wasabi, the Hotate Trufa roll, the Volcano roll and the Salmon pressed sushi. All of them were delicious, great portion size and beautifully presented. The STAR of the show was the pressed salmon sushi. It comes in a rectangular shape with torched salmon on top and the flavour from this sushi is INCREDIBLE. We loved it so much we almost ordered a second dish. My friend and I both agreed that it was one of the best meals we have had together, and we go out to eat a lot. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. We loved the cozy space and the the fusion menu concept. Cute, comfy, yummy.",1
"Brendan at Brooklyn pizza made our night. Besides the fact that the pizza was delicious, our drinks were perfect. 10/10 would come again for Brendan #Brendan2020",1
Hidden gem- they're always poppin but they do great work!!! Very reasonably priced too.,1
"I've been in Vegas for a little over a year and I can honestly say Grimaldi's has the best pesto pizza hands down! I got the personal for $10 and had left overs! The caesar salad is also pretty yum. The service is always top notch, the pizza is consistently aHh-MaZiNG, and it's only a 7 minute drive from the hale.I gotta say... Grimaldi's coupled with Sambalatte enhances the experience by 10x's. Got a new favorite pizza joint, YES! =)",1
"Great food with a touch of middle eastern ingredients. Tamarind beef is a MUST-TRY! Falafel dish is just amazing paired their house made hummus. The cocktails & wine menu offers a variety of tastes including sweet, sour, spicy and etc.We went back again for brunch, great options on the brunch menu as well. I loved the mushroom and caramelized onion benny. Their pancake tower is again a Must-Try, it is probably the best pancake I have had in Toronto; it comes with bananas, banana whipped cream (delicious) and maple syrup. The right amount of sweetness and saltiness. The chef def knows what he is doing.",1
"This. Place. Is. So. Good. And worth every penny. It might seem a little expensive but trust me, it's worth it. The meat is high quality and the service is fast. I've had Japanese bbq at other places and this was definitely the best experience I've had so far.Everything tasted great and the restaurant was not too loud or smoky. There is a time limit though, so watch your time! The staff will let you know when your time is coming to an end and give you a heads up for when it's your last call for anything else.",1
"Love the philly steak pizza! One of my absolute favorites. Have enjoyed the wings as well. Friendly staff, will continue to enjoy La Bocce!",1
"We came her for dinner our first night in town and made it a priority to eat here again before we left. Service is awesome, super friendly staff. After the waiter found out it was our first time he came back with multiple sauces that he put together. Drinks, good. Food, great. I would definitely come here all the time if I lived in Toronto.",1
All custom iron is a quality company did take pride in your work Winship they go all the way to the end of the job and make sure that everything is top Notch. I would highly recommend them for any job did you have great people to work with something that you don't see anymore very glad they put my patio cover upTerry Armitage,1
"I had NO idea that I would love this place nearly as much as I did, but WOW. The butterfly garden was UNBELIEVABLE.  Most things were handicap accessible, which made it also tons of fun for my sweet grandma to enjoy as well.  We were blown away and it was truly BEAUTIFUL.  You must go, Clevelanders!",1
This hotel is one of the BEST hotels that I have stayed in. The hotels smells with fresh flowers everywhere with modern deco. The room is beautiful with flat panel tv's. Everything in this hotel is incredible without the smell of cigarettes like most hotels have.,1
"Best service I've had at a restaurant in a while. Preston, our waiter was so patient and friendly. The food was fantastic. I was craving Alfredo and chicken but it wasn't on the menu, but Preston made it happen. So awesome! Can't wait to come back here, if you want great Italian look no further!",1
"When I walked in today, I asked if the YELP checkin discount was still in effect. They said it is, and I realized that I'd never done a review here. A complete oversight on my part. As a grown up, it took me a few visits to realize that the name, CHEBA HUT, was a marijuana reference. I even commented once that the Jamaican Red (my sandwich of choice) had no jerk seasoning on it ‍. Pot theme aside, this place is fantastic. And I'm not just talking about the food. Ever since I got my MBA, business models have started to jump out at me. This place is a brilliant business model. It's well thought out, and everyone should be comfortable here. It's got a reasonable price point and the decor fits the scheme without making you uncomfortable. Also, the munchies are EVERYTHING. who'd have thought that you could through Apple Jacks or Cap'N Crunch into a Rice Krispy Treats recipe?!?!Eat here, and bring your grandmother and your kids. Everyone will love it.",1
"This is a really special place. The coffee is consistently good and prepared with care without being obsessive about it. The food choices are at once extraordinary (in the sense of out of the ordinary) and comforting (in the sense of comfort food). The atmosphere is always relaxed and friendly, no matter how crowded it is, and the service is friendly, personable and prompt. The wifi is usually strong, and the music is eclectic without being obtrusive. Its tucked away but close enough to UNLV to be considered a ""college"" coffee shop. I personally find it a good place to work, to schedule meetings and to bring my kids -- sometimes all in the same visit. And I always leave feeling better than when I came in!",1
"We used the roundtrip limo service from Presidential on our trip to Vegas this weekend for 8 students and I have to say it was fantastic -- the only way to arrive and depart Vegas with that many people, truly.Adele was our driver both times and she was great! Truly made us feel special, and was hilarious. The ladies loved getting roses when she arrived, and we enjoyed the bottle of champagne to drink on our way in. She also took us to the liquor store on our way to Vdara where we were staying, and was a wealth of information on what to see and where to go.Thanks again for making the trip special! We'll be back, and will definitely use Presidential Limo again!",1
Ok so I hate standing in lines for anything let alone when I'm hungry but when it comes to good BBQ I can deal with it.  Nothing fancy just good meats and sides that really make you wanting more.  The portions are good sizes so it's hard to walk away feeling like you missed anything.  Also if your wanting a wide selection get here early because once they are out of an item it's done for the day. Staff very friendly and fun.,1
"As I opened the door. The cool air in the shop treated me  to a pleasant welcoming, massaging my face and complementing my workout attire. The ambiance  welcomed me with a coffee smell, mixing comfort and design perfectly. I was greeted by the barista as soon as I gazed upon the menu, Her eyes glistening and so were mine. I decided on getting the ""ABEJA""The smell was a surprisingly smooth and the honey made it amazing, a true thrill for my belly. The smell was circulating the shop and I gazed around as I enjoyed my beverage. The first attraction for me was the futuristic concept , the white walls made everything look very tidy. Everything was place meticulously, tables with transparent glass, and art work that was a real treat for my eyes. The whole setting of the bar allows customers to look at everything, it was an open kitchen style bar. Overall exquisite experience!",1
"Love love love the views of downtown Phoenix!  Food was amazing, friendly service, and a great atmosphere!",1
"David from Dryer Fires LV was phenomenal! He arrived within the time frame given, and off the bat he demonstrated genuine customer service. David was quite thorough with his work and the explanations of the problems and how he would resolve the issues. He took before and after pictures so we knew exactly what needed to be done. We felt extremely satisfied with the job performance of the company. We highly recommend his business. We'll be going through Dryer Fires LV for future vent cleaning and dryer maintenance. Thank you Dryer Fires LV!!",1
"Excellent food choices, taste great and reasonably priced. The food choices were geared to bring healthy and nutritious, everything was cooked appropriately, the inside of the restaurant was neat and clean, plenty of parking. Their was not a thing not to like about this place.",1
"I was wandering around after an interview and just happened to stumble upon this small salad joint. It was a bit busy but the staff were very kind and efficient. They quickly took my order ( I opted for the salad special) and prepared it diligently. In terms of the salad itself, it tasted as fresh as it looked and their sauces were full of flavour. For about $7 (with tax), you definitely get your money's worth, if not more. If I'm ever in the area again, I will have to try out another one of their salads!",1
Never been here except for the Tuesday special but that's one helluva deal on a great sandwich,1
"We were at a nearby professional gallery and ran into a framing/hanging problem that needed a quick, creative solution, so we Googled to find a nearby frame store to help us with it, and found The Workshop Gallery. What a lucky find! Julie was incredibly helpful, and took the time to think hard about how to solve the problem, trying different things until she found a truly creative one that would be safe and look professional. She was friendly and engaging while she worked, and based on our experience today, we would trust her expertise with any framing job.Thanks Julie, for saving our bacon!",1
"What an awesome place! Hidden in a neighborhood, we would have never found it without our friends recommendation. We had the Peanut butter and bacon burger. It was delish! My husband also had the ginger beer, was very gingerly. The location was really cool. Outside seating mainly. I was in awe. Food was great. Somehow I felt it would have been even better with milk shakes on their menu. We will be back! Give it a try! You will not be disappointed!",1
"I've never had better Mimosas or service from anywhere and being a born and raised Houstonian, I actually tried this chain in Denver for the first time and it holds the same standard city to city and obviously state to state. Chef Gordon Ramsey should check them out. If that's impossible all of their employees deserve recognition for the way they easily connect with guests no matter their race or what they're dressed like.",1
LOVE THIS PLACE. Such friendly staff and Amazing name brand things for so cheap! Got lots of nice teas that they sell at frys for 4x the price! Also scored the cutest Christmas outfits for my dog children. Sorry dollar tree I'm a 99 cent store type of chick now!,1
"Went with the bestie the other night (with no kids) for an impromptu ""catch up"" dinner and we hadn't had Korean bbq in quite some time. I was worried that it would he too loud to just chat. The ambiance was fun and noise level was ok for a weekday night. Our server was friendly and helpful but he didn't explain what each of the sides were before the meats came out. No worries, we're adventurous eaters, but we still had to ask. We didnt care for the ""soups"" that were brought out but enjoyed the steamed egg and seaweed salad. We ordered the family dinner for 2, reasonably priced for all that we got: skirt steak, short rib, spicy short rib, and spicy pork belly. Our server cooked our meats for us and asked how we liked our meats. Our faves were the short ribs and spicy short rib! The cheese sauce was ok. The meats were seasoned enough that we didnt feel it was necessary. We were disappointed in the pork belly. It looked like shredded pork after it was cooked. We were expecting something crisper. Anyhoo ice cream sandwich dessert was included which was a nice surprise. We left happy and full",1
The best cupcakes I've ever had Leah is professional and helpful with your cake needs the right cake for the right celebration,1
"It might sound strange that I am a vegetarian and yet this is one of my favorite restaurants-- that is how much I love their Farm salad! It has the freshest ingredients! I also LOVE their veggie burger-- one of the best veggie burgers I've had. Even though I am a vegetarian, I usually dine with meat lovers and everyone I've ever gone here with has loved their meal.  When going with a group, it is also fun to share a few of their different types of fries-- sweet potato, truffle, zucchini, etc.  Also, their salted caramel shake is perhaps my favorite dessert of all time!  Whether you are vegetarian or a meat-lover, you will love this place.",1
"My 5 stars is entirely for one item on this menu: The Porco Pizza. Their housemade dough topped with mozzarella cheese, slow roasted pulled pork, caramelized onions and serrano peppers and then woodfired to perfection (golden brown with just the smallest, light black spots here and there). When it comes to pizza I often like to stick to the basics or more traditional pies, my usual go to would either be supreme or just plain pepperoni, but with La Bocca it's gotta be the Porco. It's just that good.It's been awhile since I have gone with friends and actually sat down, the last time I did it was the Mill location and service/atmosphere was solid, no complaints. I'm not sure if I'd like it as much here cause it is such a small location that it does seem a bit cramped. Anyways, I always just end up getting take out, the bartender has always been friendly and quick. Never keeps me waiting to pay or anything like that. If I do show up earlier than the food is finished, they usually give me a time estimate for how much longer and are always within a minute. The pizza's there are 12-inch and the Porco comes out to $14 something after tax, so it is a bit pricier, although so worth it as a nice little treat after a long week or something. Plus, the 12-inch is still enough for my girlfriend and I or a friend and I to split as a small dinner, or take it home eat half by myself and have half the next day for a light lunch. If you go with another person and want to try it though but want a bit more food, you can always do another pizza or get their bruschetta which comes with 4 planks and they have like 6-8 different styles that you get to choose from for each plank. The bread/dough/all their ingredients really are amazing so it's hard to go wrong. I have never had any of their salads, but a friend got one once and she said it was really good. Both this and the Tempe location have been putting out consistent quality food wise, haven't noticed a real difference there between the two. The Tempe location is definitely bigger though.",1
"My military husband was impressed. He Said,""just like they served it in iwakuni"". Easy on the wallet. $2 beer. Hot and deliciois. 4 bowls gets free appetizer and a punch card.",1

"I had an amazing experience here. Sarah j helped me find the missing piece to my flamingo costume, hot pink hot pants. She was very friendly and knowledgeable and I will be coming back for sure",1
A must do if you're visiting Scottsdale or greater Phoenix area!  Zach was a fun and knowledgeable tour guide.  We did the sip and sample tour and sampled yummy cocktails paired with some delicious food!  The pork tacos at The Mission were out of this world and we will definitely be back to Bootleggers after this tour!  Ended at AZ88 and our crew decided to stay because we enjoyed it so much!  Well organized tour with a company that cares about delivering a high quality experience.,1
"This place is great atmosphere and delicious food!  Bring a coat in the fall/winter if you are eating outside because it can get fairly cold.  Also, if you go there on First Friday be expected to wait about an hour for you food.   The Blue Sky burger is off the chain.",1
"I originally found out about this business using Groupon. I recently bought a 2015 Nissan Versa Note SV through someone on Offer Up, and it needed a 90,000 mile service. They were able to honor the Groupon, which was for $175. I also requested for them to use Full Synthetic oil and tire rotation. I was advised by Ardi that the tire rotation would be an extra $10 and the full synthetic oil would be an extra $25; however, he told me that if I could give them a good review on Yelp & Google, I can get have them waived. I haven't seen my car yet, so I'm not quite sure about the work yet, but so far, the service has been good. He did tell me that my car needed some work. For example, it needed a new serpentine drive belt. He offered to do the service for me for $150 today instead of $175. I'm currently on a budget, so I kindly declined. I'll have to get that done another time. I really appreciate that he didn't push for me to have it. He even offered to give me paperwork on what my car needed, and it will apparently be listed from the most important to the least important. I would definitely recommend this place to others because the affordability is most important for me at the moment, so thanks A+!So when I went inside of my car, everything seems to be good so far. It didn't smell like gasoline, or anything weird. Ardi did give me paperwork regarding the services that were provided today along with his list of recommendations. He also listed the prices. I wrote over what he meant for the 2nd recommendations. Thank you, Ardi, for your attention to detail.",1
Such an amazing team Ricky and his team are!! He captured our wedding day like nobody could ever have!!!!! We are forever grateful!!! U are just amazing!!!!!! I recommend memory lane to everyone!

Tyler was awesome ! He was so helpful with ordering process. We loved our drinks !! Thanks !,1
There are many Sushi places but few Sushi Masters....this gentleman has many years of experience and it shows......no all you can eat poor quality here just super fresh generous portions.....even the plain rice is better here...Quality rice cooked perfectly....I recommend the Chirashi generous slices of Sashimi served on a bed of rice....I saw some of the Korean dishes ordered by others and they looked awesome....Im going to try that next time!...now for an afternoon nap,1
"Great food , excellent service . Wait staff was very courteous and engaging . I come here once in a while, with the boss as a nice treat. Chicken cabresa sandwich is delicious, and whatever you try , you won't be disappointed !!!",1
Traditional menu but the OMG Chicken sandwich is to die for. Great service today by Allie. You've got to stop in.,1
"If you're in the area, you must try Dear Fro's bingsu! You won't find bingsu this good anywhere else in the Greater Toronto Area.The bingsu are served fluffy & light, like an untouched Canadian snow pile; not to mention filled with plenty of to-die-for creaminess.It's so amazing, it's a pity you can't get anything similar other than at Dear Fro in the city.Also, the place is small, cozy and nice - a perfect place to just relax and enjoy some bingsu. 5 stars for these reasons.",1
"Great experience, Jason was fast and really nice, made me a delicious dirty chai tea.",1
"If I could eat here every day, I would. I don't care that it's expensive. Everything was delicious. The food came out in record time, and I nearly stuffed myself as the waiter talked me OUT of dessert (he told me, ""you really don't HAVE to."" But, no, I do...)The deviled eggs appetizer was one of the best things I've eaten. Like, ever. The Ramsay Tonic was yummy and refreshing. I ordered the Fish and Chips because I felt like I just *had* to, and they didn't disappoint. Everything was delicious. I loved the ambiance, the over-sized chairs and high tables, and pretty much everything about this place. Just go.",1
Amazing place! like a queen west place but more trendy and in the financial core. Had the trinidadian geera pork sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. service is awesome as well and a great crowd. Definately a place to come back to!,1
Parvin is amazing! No wonder she is so busy and has so many reviews. I will definitely be a client for life!! She makes waxing as painless as possible and is super fast but also very thorough.,1
"Couldn't believe how awesome this hole in the wall dumpling place is. We ordered 4 dishes and they all exceeded expectations. Two that stood out were the fu man special fried rice and the pork and chive dumplings. Fantastic service, place all around is a must try.",1
Came here after seeing the good ratings on yelp and it did not disappoint! You walk in and order what you want and pay before seated. You get a table number and get to choose where you want to sit and the food will be taken to your table number. I ordered the French toast on challah bread with a strawberry jam-type drizzled on top with blueberries and whipped cream. It came with FOUR pieces!! So it was very filling. We also ordered the blueberry ricotta pancakes. I expected the ricotta to be pretty overwhelming but to my surprise it wasn't too much! I liked the combination with the blueberries and the pancakes were very fluffy:) Service was really nice and the restaurant wasn't too busy or crowded. Would definitely recommend this place and maybe even come here again to try their sandwiches.,1
"Five stars for service, menu, prices and quality. Our waiter was zealous and friendly, he gave us information on the foods we were not acquainted to. He ended up earning a fat tip from my husband. Thank you, sorry I have forgotten your name. Although this restaurant is long ways from us, it is worth the extra miles.",1
"I was in town for the Indians game on Sunday and decided to take my family to a familiar restaurant, Harry Buffalo. We are always satisfied with the he food as well as with the service but we thought this trip deserved a review. Our waitress Taylor made our experience above average and definitely better than what we are used to! She was on top of everything even with a full restaurant. We never once wanted for anything and for that, we were truly thankful and happy with our choice of restaurant for dinner! Thank you Harry Buffalo for a great meal and thank you Taylor for an even better experience!",1
"Celine crushes it live, period. If you are on the fence about it, just pull the trigger, she sings almost all of her top hits and they do not disappoint!Show spoiler from here on out!  She started off with a music video of submitted fan clips singing to I Drove All Night then top hits, transitions to a french song and some jazz ones and then finishes off with more top hits (some duets). In total the show is about 1.5 hours. We spent 113$ on the back section but in the middle row (and center) for $113 all in and it was totally worth it. Not really any bad seats in the entire stadium.",1
One of best sushi place in West coast. Kind waitress and sushi chef. That was pretty gorgeous experience in Vegas that never expected to find nice sushi bar. Fresh and tasty which I wanted tonight.,1
"Only for adventurous eaters. Don't go if you don't want to try something new. I'm tempted to take away a star for the crowds and the noise, but I don't want to hate on them for being too popular. Five stars. Great prices for what you get.",1
Food is always great. The kitchen staff is on the ball all the time. Not long wait for hot food. The servers rock. Manager Marcus is very friendly and willing to assist anytime.,1
"took my grandson who is visiting from the south to the buffet on sunday morning, he and i both enjoyed the variety of selections and the freshness of the food.every thing we tasted was superb, the staff was friendly and the ambience was great.i'd go back and eat here as often as i can.way to go boulder station hotel and casino.",1
"This is a very nice store. If you're looking for Gundam and the latest Star Wars model kits, this is the place to go. There is a huge variety and the prices are what you'd expect. I was looking for Space Battleship Yamato models. They had a few, one that I will definitely buy later on, but not the mecha collection. Then again, those are hard to find unless you buy online. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. The employees are super nice and the store was immaculately clean.",1
This wonderful gem is very near our house and we love to drop in.  The veggies are quite fresh and the meat flavor a excellent.  The service is great and caring.  You can eat healthy here as well with the selection of fresh ingredients.,1
"The party pizza is perfect for any occasion! Delish!!!!! 5 stars.. Also the dining room is great for any banquet or luncheon... Great food, nice place!",1
We live in VA and visit Scottsdale every winter. Always look forward to maintaining our workout routine at Golds. Trent is very helpful and the rest of the staff are always friendly.,1
"Bad Breath BurgerCarne AsadaCould not stop saying ""mmmmmmmmm"" the entire meal.Good atmosphere, good service.  What more can you ask for?",1
"A measure of great ice cream or gelato is how well they do vanilla. Imported Madagascar & Tahitian vanilla beans in a thick creamy gelato was incredible!!  They only use fresh ingredients, no filler, all thriller! It's a luxurious dessert experience - visit this place now!!",1
These people will take care of you.,1
"They are great with my two big dogs. We can't get them to stop squirming when we try to cut their nails, but the folks at Claws & Paws make it seem easy. Our dogs actually love coming here.",1
I came here the other afternoon for an event and I had a really enjoyable time. I loved the decor and the overall ambiance of the outside seating area. They have a great concept of using local and fresh products and I think it's awesome how they have vegetables and fruit growing on site. I had a zucchini flatbread that the zucchini was picked that morning! I look forward to returning here at another time to see what other new dishes they are serving.,1
"I love his personality on stage.  Remember Maryann Alan?  She told me how she encouraged you years ago in Orlando.  Anyway, great job last night as it was a really fun show.  I recommend it.  Eat at Tender first and then go see Carrot Top!4/8/17We are going to see you again in June so I hope your show is new.  Can't wait.",1
"I just moved to the area and I took my dog to get an exam with Dr. Cutler. The staff was very welcoming and courteous. They had already phoned his previous vet and obtained his records by the time we had arrived. Nancy, the nurse, brought us in. She was very gentle with my dog and he felt at ease in no time. We saw Dr. Cutler and she was excellent. She listened to all of my concerns and answered each one of my questions. She did mention his dental health but she did not corner me into booking an expensive dental procedure right off the bat, like other vets we have seen. I understand he may need it, but Dr. Cutler recommended some products first, without pressuring me. Wouldn't you know, he loves the food she recommended, so we will be returning to pick up a supply! This office is highly recommended!",1
Awesome Venue. Don't really understand why reviews are so bad. I had a great time here. Just don't order wine. It's terrible.,1
"What a unique, awesome little veggie spot.  I'm guessing it's more busy during lunch during the semester, because whenever I go the place seems empty, but the atmosphere is welcoming and decorated in a cool way with an earthy feel, deep colors, and live plants.  I've had two of the wraps on the menu; they were really awesome creations with lots of fresh ingredients, interesting tofu and other meat substitutes, and delicious sauces.  I haven't tried the falafel yet, but I haven't had a reason to resort to that since there are so many other interesting things on the menu!  This is a really cool spot and deserves more exposure.  Finding a vegetarian restaurant is hard enough on its own - when you find one that serves great food you can't help but appreciate it even more.",1
"UNREAL. Delicious. Most places have a very bland Chicken Tikka Masala, but this is the most flavorful dish I've had in AGES. If I ever move from this city I have to ask Faraz to give me cooking lessons. All of the food was amazing. great levels of low heat so it's good for everyone to try. Get some spinach pakora as well--great starter and HUGE portions! If you aren't going to Tulips, are you really even eating Indian food?",1
"FIVE STAR RESTAURANT! I decided to spend my birthday at Sinatra this year and I must say this was one of the best birthday experiences I have ever had. As I arrived at my dining table, there was a cute little card waiting for me on the table. I opened it up and it was a HAND-WRITTEN birthday card. I thought it was very sweet that the restaurant went out of their way to hand-write a birthday card for me...quite a memorable characteristic indeed. As for the food...I could not believe that this restaurant has an entire vegan menu. I am not vegan, but am lactose intolerant and they were able to modify all dishes to meet my dietary needs. And all of the food spectacular! For my starter, I ordered the beef carpaccio served with salsa verde, wild arugula, shaved parmigiano, and croutons. Excellent combination.For my main course, I had the agnolotti filled with butternut squash and served with sage, parmesan, and brown butter. They made this dish completely dairy-free for me. I have seen a similar dish at several other restaurants, however I can never order it due to its high dairy content. I must say I was impressed with these accommodations. For dessert, I ordered  the bomba al cioccolato made with Valrhona chocolate cake, raspberries and passion fruit sorbet. DAIRY FREE. This is the best vegan dessert I have ever  tasted in my life. It did not taste vegan at all...actually tasted quite normal :) The combination of the cake the with sorbet went perfectly together.The ambiance is elegant and lovely. There are photos of Frank Sinatra all around with charming Sinatra music playing in the background. They also gifted me and my entire party with Holiday Frank Sinitra CDs!! Can you believe that? We all left with Sinatra CDs! If thats not going over the top...then I don't know what is. The bathrooms are also beautiful. The bathrooms are technically the Encore hotel bathrooms, but regardless they have HAIRSPRAY and hand lotion in BOTH the men's and women's powder rooms. And the hand lotion smells amazing!Finally, I must comment on the service as it was outstanding. We dined as a party of 6 and asked our server to provide each of us with individual itemized receipts (for reimbursement purposes). The server did not complain or have any problems with our request. In fact, he remembered each of our items and was happy to fulfill our request.I highly recommend checking out Sinatra in Las Vegas. I had an absolutely phenomenal dining experience!",1
"This place was great. Very chic, modern, and Ramsay like. Pricing is reasonable and the food was amazing. The fries we couldn't even finish because the burgers were out of this world. Absolutely fantastic. The only flaw about this experience was the wait, but who can complain when one is in a world known chef restaurant with mouth watering food. I'll tell you, it was worth the wait.Sidenote: they do not have ranch or BBQ sauce here",1
"My first time visiting Cleveland and first time at an Aloft Hotel. Very impressed with friendly service, cleanliness, and comfortable beds! Great location within walking to restaurants, river walk, and pubs. Look forward visiting again!",1
"I literally daydream about this place. Andre was an excellent server and made the BEST recommendations. Try the bread, oysters, grilled octopus, Lebaneh with feta, moussaka, Brussels sprouts, buratta salad, and the lamb tartare. Also, if you haven't had Turkish coffee, try it at least once. GREAT restaurant. Can't wait to go back!",1
Great foodGreat venue had my Christmas party here everyone had a great timeOver 400 peopleHad a great variety of food good examples of the fare that is avaliable dailySome really simple dishes and other extraordinary Simply the dolphins stole the show,1
This place is always our go-to when we can't figure out another brunch place and never disappoints. The staff is always been super nice and attentive. The food selections is great with a good portion of the menu going to their awesome specialty pancakes. We got the classic egg Benedict. Perfect poached eggs. The chicken fried steak is one of my favorites!  Sooooo good!   Def a favorite place of our for brunch.,1
I have been using Valerie's company since 2012.  Before Valerie I had minimal leads to my website.  She is proactive and reviews the website analytics  regularly.  She does marketing every month to ensure search engine optimization and social media are current.  I highly recommend eSpark Marketing.,1
"If i could 10 stars i would,I was in need of a hair emergency and I was from out of town. I needed help badly because I was supposed to be having my Bachelorette party and I had no time to get my hair done before I left I went online googled hair salons and Hair Xperts came up. I didn't make an appointment I rushed right in Cesar helped me. He took one look at my hair and said ""girl I got this"" . He turned my nightmare into a total triumph.  He did the most beautiful cut and color on my drab hair it looked so natural.  Besides the work they are professional and the salon is really nice. Noel & Cesar really care about their clients and you can tell they love what they do because they put so much love in their work. I had sooo much fun with them both they are so funny. The whole staff is nice. I walked out of there feeling like a million bucks. I know I'm from out of town but I'm definitely coming back they are worth it. I suggest you do too you'll love the results!",1
"My better half and I have dined in and carried out at least 3 times in the past month and we've enjoyed the same great quality of dishes each time.Having visited for lunch and dinner, Arova Shawarma & Falafel has a very steady stream of hungry and satisfied customers alike.We've tried the laffa's and pita's and enjoyed them immensely!Toppings available include: hummus, tomato, cucumber, coleslaw, dill or Israeli pickles; black or green olives; jalapenos, fried onions and fried eggplant (my favorite!).Sauces to choose from: tahini, garlic or spicy mayo; hot sauce, bbq, ketchup and honey mustard. Booths and tables available.Free parking.Restrooms.Able to place an order from the touchscreen just inside the entrance, phone ahead or place online to jump the queue",1
I am blown away with the quality of ingredients they use here. I didn't think it would matter to me and I didn't think I would be able to taste the difference. But the flavors are REAL. No artificial syrup tastes. Also the owner is a super sweet woman. We love talking with her. The atmosphere is fun and we always see people playing board games or doing homework here. A very inviting space.,1
"Johnny made me feel at home as soon as I walked through the door. He actually came outside to greet me and offered me something to drink before I even sat down. It was my first session ever so I was obviously nervous but that quickly went away as we got to know each other. Throughout the entire process, Johnny asked if I had any questions and made me feel very comfortable. I had a really great experience and can't wait to have another session.",1
"I've been meaning to try this place for a while and I'm glad I finally did.  My server just told me they are starting a wine club in November!  I've been looking for a wine club since I moved to Gilbert.  But back to the review.  I love the ambiance.  Trendy but not snobby with great couch seating and an area where they have live music.  My wife and I came during happy hour on a Wednesday evening around 5 and it was not busy so we got our drinks and calamari pretty quickly.  I had the Creek's Old Fashioned which was perfect for bourbon lovers.  They had a good wine/beer/liquor selection and decent happy hour deals.  The calamari came out piping hot and perfectly cooked.  My Grilled cheese and Crispy Prosciutto was amazing - on par with my other favorite restaurant, Perfect Pear.  My wife had the pork chops with pineapple chutney.  Delicious.  There were a lot of menu items that I will be coming back to try.  With app, drinks, meals, and tip, we got out for about $75. For high end food and drinks, I feel like we got our money's worth.",1
"The brews are consistently great, but you can still get a basic assortment of mixed drinks too. They're always adding new reasons to come back (e.g. trivia & shuffleboard nights), and each day of the week they bring in a different local restaurant to do food after 5 p.m. What I really enjoy about this place is how laid back it is. Doggos and fat-cheeked babies result in a much nicer atmosphere on the patio (what a patio!) than a swarm of bros and ladies going to the meat market. Hope the vibe stays the same as it gets more popular here.",1
Best spot ever!!  Seafood towers and the butter cream cake was to DIE!   U must order for dinner (u can share).  Suggest making reservations for the tree house,1
"You will simply not find a nicer place to eat if you're looking for great Mediterranean food.  You're NEVER a number, you're a friend. They've cheefully followed through on special requests I've made on several occasions when I've eaten there and the quality of the food has always been consistant. Even on the two Grand Opening Nights, the service and quality of the food was fantastic as was apparent by the tremendous lines that were forming outside the door!",1
"i have had Earl's sandwiches at all hours of the day...  in all sorts of different states of mind. and regardless of whatever I'm feeling at that moment, the sandwiches never fail to send me to taste bud heaven. depending on your state, the size of the sandwich satisfies any type of craving possible. It could be the perfect portion (late night drunk munchies status), or even way too much (sober lunch/dinner, when you are thinking logically and decide not to stuff yourself by saving the other half for late night snackage). prices are super reasonable (about $6 per sandwich), and the selection is huge!the eating area is located at the edge of the casino area. it's far enough so that customers can avoid the smell of smoke and loud cheers, but it is also close enough so you are able to keep a watchful (and rather entertained) eye on your belligerent friends who insist on playing poker drunk. (or vice versa... both ways work :D)no matter the distance the hotel happens to be to PH, i ALWAYS make a trip to Earl's. definitely worth it!",1
"I can thoroughly recommend this ""old-style European"" tailor for your alterations.   I purchased an expensive blue blazer at The Wizard of Aahs online store (http://www.thewizardofaahs.com/ - another great recommendation) knowing that it would need alterations.  I took it to Jose who did a very professional job of taking in the jacket for the reasonable price of $60, with a three-day turnaround.",1
Great find! We had lunch here the other day and it was fantastic. I had the shrimp caesar and it was great and garlicky with zesty dressing. My husband had the roast beef sandwich with slaw and our friend had the goat cheese and beet salad. They also had $5 off all glasses of wine! Yippee! Very friendly service and nice upscale vibe. They even had the movie ELF showing (it's Christmas time) Highly recommend and would definitely go back when in town!,1
"Outstanding beer list, very knowledgeable staff, great atmosphere, and the beer list is extensive and impressive. Get the flight if you don't know what you want, try 5 samples for like $12. I'm not from the area and wasn't familiar with many of the beers so it was great to be able to try a bunch at once!I had the jalapeño hushpuppies - good, but I missed the classic seasoning on them. But the pulled pork sandwich was a homerun. Juicy, fall off the bone pork with a terrific spicy BBQ sauce. Highly recommended!",1
"Really unique flavors like coconut lemongrass lime sorbet, sweet cream and passion fruit, whiskey Irish cream, strawberry guava sorbet while also providing the classics. Love the creativity and small shop feel. Best gelato I've had stateside compared to gelato in Italy. Location kind of hard to find because tucked inside AZ sandwich co and the sign isn't very obvious. Also looks like a corporate building from the outside.",1
"I've known retired Fireman Dave Hall for years. Firemen's Limo is one of the oldest, most reliable, premium car services in Cleveland!  On time for early morning pick ups and late night drop offs.  Safe and professional for long distance and out-of-state trips as well.   Highly recommend!",1
"What a great restaurant! and staff! Originally we planned to host our event in the main Arcadia Cafe, but decided to move to The Hacienda, across the street from the main facility. The room is beautiful with a Spanish mission influence.All of the food -- appetizers, salad, entrees and dessert -- was fabulous.  Our servers were friendly and efficient in serving the large crowd. Our guests continued to compliment the food, service and decor for days afterward.We thank everyone at Arcadia Farms for making our evening truly special.",1
"So, so good. We've ordered the 9 piece a few times and have had the fries, mashed potatoes, and gravy. All were excellent. We'll be returning for sure.",1
"My husband and I traveled to Las Vegas to see a show at a different casino/hotel; we originally booked a room at that hotel as it made sense to do so since the show was there...after reading bad reviews we quickly knew it wasn't the right place for us so I started my search for something nicer and within our budget. It took me all of 5 minutes to come across The Cosmopolitan and I knew right away that this is where I wanted to stay. I read through countless reviews first and was worried it would be considerably out of our price range...but it wasn't! It was actually only $60 more than we were going to spend at the other hotel. I showed my husband the pictures and reviews and we booked a room that night. We arrived on Sunday October 18th- Valet is quick and friendly; it's a major step up from any other valet we've ever used,  which is many. Check in: We were up to the counter within 30 seconds of walking up. Check in was very fast and the staff is really friendly. We were offered an upgraded room for $30 more which we quickly said yes to; which turned out to be a very wise choice. Our room was INCREDIBLE. Very clean (which is SUPER important to me). It was nice and quiet throughout the hallways; no loud patrons, parties, etc.We walked into our room to a nice seating area (living room). The room had a stocked mini fridge and a basket of goodies (not free I'll add). There's also cabinet space, sink and microwave. There's a cute 'office' area with a desk, desk lamp, television and phone. Then you enter the ""changing"" area/closet and full length mirrors. There's even a cute ottoman in the middle of the room which we used to set our luggage on. The bathroom vanity has double sinks and a lighted makeup mirror that can be sectioned off by a sliding door. The toilet is separated behind its own door. The shower is stunning with a tub at the other end as you walk through; you can soak in the tub with a nice view of the strip as you look out the window. The bedroom is a bedroom. Bed, nightstands, television and phone. The bed was super comfortable. Too bad you can fold it up and take it home with you lol. The shower has a clear glass door and window on the opposite side that faces the bedroom, the tub has an opening (no window) that also faces the bedroom..need some privacy? They have blinds that can be pulled down :) The entire room is equipped with light dimmers which can make for a calm and even romantic evening. We had a private balcony with a little loveseat & ottomon with a table and ashtray  (there's no smoking IN the room). We had the BEST view of the strip. We spent much of our time sitting/standing on the terrace just taking in the view. We were lucky enough to experience thunder/lightning and some heavy rain and we were able to enjoy it out on the terrace :)The casino is really nice. A nice selection of games. We didn't hit it big lol. Its what you expect when you go to gamble; you hope to win but you expect to lose. Luckily we didn't lose our entire gambling budget but that may be because we didn't gamble a while lot. We found other things to do in Vegas. Walk the strip, go to the show, visit the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, check out the Clark County Museum...Money- After all was said and done and with a dinner room service charge for two people, one night, our bill came to $400. We don't go to Vegas all the time, actually, this was my first time in Vegas, EVER. So in my opinion it was worth it. I have amazing photos and wonderful memories. You can't put a price on that :)I highly recommend this hotel/casino and we'll definitely be back. As a matter of fact, the room/view in itself made me want to stay in Vegas forever, no kidding.",1
"I love this place! The owners are friendly and fun to be around. The food is always really good. The menu is not huge and the wine list is small, which I think is smart for them to do. They create more of an experience than just going for a meal. They just opened their new location and are no longer on Roosevelt. You'll find them at  1616 N Central Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85004 in the MUSE Apartment complex. Their new place is larger inside with a much bigger outdoor patio. They work hard and I'd love to see them be successful at this new location.",1
"My husband and I LOVE Novanta!  Their food is incredibly fresh, high quality and so so tasty.  I have loved every wood-fired pizza of theirs I've tried, but the Margherita with Prosciutto added on is my fave.  I tried their Mozzarella Bar Option 2 today and it was delicious - very light and fresh, and I have plenty of fresh mozz with pesto for an afternoon snack later.  Their cannoli are also quite good if you get them earlier in the day and eat them right away (goes to show how fresh & natural their food is).In addition to excellent food, their service is phenomenal.  Nick and Nicole are always working extra hard to make sure their customers feel welcome and cared for.The only downside is the pizza doesn't travel super well.  The fresh-made thin crust can get soggy if not eaten shortly after coming out of the oven.  Their location on Junction Road is cozy and very clean, with great outdoor seating surrounded by a fresh herb garden in the summer.  It's well worth it to grab a seat & eat on-site.",1
All Pro Shade Concepts is awesome! They came and measured and two weeks later as promised right to the day installation was complete. Brian our installer showed up on time and installed quickly. Customer service is amazing. Other businesses should take lessons from these guys. This has been the most hassle free upgrade we have done to our home. The shades look nice and quality is good. Lots of bang for the buck!,1
"Great food here, especially the spicy falafel!  I also had the veggie, beans, and tofu wrap which was HUGE!  Good stuff!I did not try the salad bar, so I cannot comment on that.  Really great stuff, and I'll be coming back soon.  I'm getting hungry just writing this review.",1
"I love having LVIV in my neighborhood!  There's so much to enjoy from delicious fresh meats, freshly baked breads and tortes, pierogi, imported individually-wrapped chocolates, and shelves stocked with so many amazing foods from Ukraine.",1
"I been coming here for a few years now, prices are great, portions are great, service is great! Never left unsatisfied! Great quality restaurant , I highly recommend it",1
"You must acknowledge that this is not a sit and get served fast type of restaurant. This is a order and wait for heaven to be delivered. There is no beer, wine or liquor served here, however you can bring your own bottle of wine or beer and just charged a corking fee. Brilliant!! Well I recommend trying it out, enjoy!",1
"This is one of the best hotels in uptown. It's in a great location; walking distance to EpiCenter, Spectrum Center, Bank of America Stadium, BB&T Ballpark and the Convention Center.The access to everything great but right in the lobby is a pretty awesome restaurant, Coastal Kitchen Bar and Grill. You must try the deep fries deviled egg and a cocktail or two. Ask for a room facing uptown on a high floor so you can see the city skyline.",1
"This place has everything you could ask for in a local bar. The food, which is mostly sandwiches and burgers, is excellent and you can tell it's fresh and made to order. The cost of food is low as well. There is also a great variety of draft beer and it's served cold right off the tap. The environment is very welcoming and I would highly recommend this place to anyone!",1
Kevin just blasted the head of a 1952 Farmall tractor for me.  It use to be rusted and full of 65 years of grime but now it looks brand new. Thanks for helping the students at Buckeye Union High School FFA.,1
"Stopped by for a random mid-afternoon lunch, was VERY pleasantly surprised!Decor:Modern and simple, consistent with mid tier trendy bistros. Both intimate and open settings, which unexpectedly works well. Clean. Service:Very fast, courteous and professional. Food:I got the prawn (shrimp) pad Thai lunch special which comes with a cream-style Tom Yum soup (very good) and egg roll. The pad Thai portion was generous; food was flavorful and hearty, with just the right amount of spice. Overall, I'd definitely come back again and look forward to trying other items on the menu!!",1
"My wife and I flew to Toronto for the chassuna of a grandson, and after a long day of travel, we wanted a relaxing dinner with cocktails and wine.  We chose Marron, and we are thrilled that we did.  The appetizer we selected is what they call gravlax, but it's really a delicately cold-smoked (applewood) salmon exquisitely presented with capers, quacomole, jalapeno slices and shaved radish on crisp tostitos.  DELICIOUS!  My wife had rare steak (actually served rare, a rarity for a kosher restaurant) a beautifully marbled and flavorful cut of beef attractively presented with roast beets, potato, summer squash and haricots.  I had duck, same sides, almost perfectly cooked (skin not quite crisped enough, but considering overall quality, a minor quibble).  For dessert we both had creme brulee.  The service was impeccable.  The ambiance of the room very like a Parisian bistro.  All-in-all a most successful dinner.  Considering the totality of the experiance I would call the dinner a bargain!",1
"Visit date 5/4/19- Came here for my 9th Anniversary ANYTHING WAS AMAZING!!! They even gave us a glass of champagne . From the staff to Management WAS GREAT! The young lady who walked us to our table was having a bad afternoon, she was not mean or anything but there was no warm or friendly greeting with her and it was just like blah.. BUT EVERYONE ELSE MADE UP FOR IT! THE FOOD: the food was GRRAT! We had the fried okra appetizer, its the whole okra pod and was very tasteful. I  had the ""Just for the Halibut"" .. it's like you have a 3 course meal: it's fish and crab meat and spinach on top of a potato cake ...very fulfilling and loaded of flavor. My husband had the Ribeye now the ribeye is not like your regular ribeye it's more thick and round. My husband wanted it cooked medium but it came out as medium well. The waiter got the manager (my husband did not complain, she was just doing her job and asking us how was our food). The manager ended up cooking my husband another ribeye cook medium. My husband did say both ribeyes tasted good.Dessert was good too. (See photos)",1
"Best place for sushi! Love ""The Prime Time"" with Filet Mignon and Lobster. It's a must have in my book!",1
"Our uncle lives here, very quiet and private community, great location, and member are pretty friendly.",1
"Love their products! Kenny is great to work with to find the best product for your specific symptoms. I have chronic pain and inflammation and have recently found some relief, thanks to the healing panda!",1
I've actually been to this hole in the wall a few times and each time the impress me in their quick and friendly service and delicious food. The portions are huge and the flavor of each dish were amazing. I highly suggest and would definitely recommend paying them a visit. I've experienced both picking up my order an delivery service. Generally speaking the delivery service takes 30-45 minutes but on their busier days I've experienced an hour or so. In my opinion still very acceptable and worth the wait for the food. I highly suggest the fried rices and chow meins. The egg roll and crab puffs are also delicious for starters .. Their teriyaki chicken general Tao chicken Kung pao dishes and pepper beef are amazing and a personal favorite! Hope this helps:),1
Our office staff had lunch at Sala Thai this afternoon. As usual the food was excellent. I have been going their original one  located on 32nd st and Shea for years. I am glad they opened one on west side.,1
"I love Black Forge! It's my neighborhood coffee shop so I am a frequent customer. Its a really unique space with a metal/grunge vibe and an ever-changing art display (you can purchase the pieces too!). They also have different events like drag brunch and live music performances, which makes it more than just your regular old coffee shop. I credit this as one of the businesses that is leading the revitalization of the Allentown business district. The coffee and specialty lattes/drinks are also delicious. They use their own homemade syrups in a lot of them which is FANTASTIC. I definitely recommend getting any of the drinks that comes with one of these syrups. They carry a variety of locally made baked goods too, which I almost always get. They have both savory and sweet and I think I've tried them all by now. (Definitely get the oatmeal cream pie!) The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I think the owner is a 20-something woman too, which is AWESOME. Support your women-owned businesses! They recently secured a loading zone spot in front of their storefront, which has made a world of difference in terms of convenience. They're located next to a police station where all of the immediate parking is reserved for police vehicles, but now we have a spot! I highly recommend this place!",1
"Fantastic, above-and-beyond service!Purchased a Tropitone fire pit through about 5 years ago and had it drop shipped to my house in WA state.  Wet weather and neglect by me led to the need for some parts to be replaced so I tried to contact my local Tropitone dealer and got zero response.  I thought I'd reach out to All American and Andy really took the time to make sure I got the parts I needed from the factory.  Couldn't ask for better customer service!",1
"Top notch Buffet. Crew are the stand outs. Writing this review as i am still here. Vangie, a station attendant was the most gracious host! Came in for breakfast during the week. Food was delicious!",1
Hope everybody gets their order from Robert Thomas because he made sure everything was clear and easy to order offering solid customer service and friendly attitude that assures I will come back for superior service.,1
"Best experience I've had with a moving company! Dustin and David were our movers and they were timely, professional, and friendly.  None of my furniture was ruined and they were very cautious and careful not to bump into walls. I hope I won't have to move for the next couple years, but if I do, I'll be calling this company!",1
"It doesn't get much better than this for seafood and cocktails.While here, we raided the raw bar menu having oysters on the 1/2 shell, raw clams, and their jumbo shrimp. All were fresh and delicious.  Also, they serve a little bit of horseradish on top of their cocktail sauce to add a little extra spice for those who crave it.The bartender here was helpful, quick, and friendly. He was knowledgable and able to provide beer recommendations based on my taste. In addition, he made excellent mixed drinks.",1
Great place. Great Pizza. We only ordered and sat at the Pizza by the slice booth but we just needed a quickie bite somewhere cool and comfortable. Pepperoni and Picante slices were awesome! Can't wait to visit again and try the Purple Potato slice!,1
"We love Southwest, this is my favorite airline. There is not ""stretch seating"" ""comfort plus"" blah blah that other airlines push on you. You get your ticket, you get a letter assigned for boarding and you're on your way. Free baggage is a plus, and you still get a snack and a drink. Leg room is pleasant. We fly non-stop from Omaha to Las Vegas. One time out of probably 20 times there was a problem. 1 time and they fixed it. The plane was broken. They couldn't fix it in Omaha, they tried. So they had to had to fly a crew from Chicago to Omaha to fix it. That ate up about 5 hours. 7 hours later we were in the air. Before departing, the gate attendant said that if you wish to keep your flight (people were cancelling and leaving) to come to the gate. We were all given a $200 credit to be used on a ticket to any SW destination. Holy moly. We played it right and our next Vegas trip was paid for. Nice and apologetic. Always customer service. I can tell you, if you complain about SW take a delta flight. Always late, rude, and they kiss the ass of the credit card holders over the intercom. Frontier, no free drinks. You have to buy a drink. American Airlines, nice and friendly BUT late late late.",1
"I realize that giving a place 5 stars is a big deal. And declaring Spudnuts ""as good as it gets"" is no mistake. Say it with me...Y.U.M. The doughnuts are incredible. They are super tender and not the so-sweet-you-need-a-root-canal-immediately-after-consumption type either. Don't get me wrong, they are a seriously delish indulgence, but they are perfectly balanced. In general, I prefer crullers. Theirs are no exception. I also adore their sour cream doughnuts. Amazing. Stop reading. Get in the car. Drive to Spudnuts. Now!",1
"My husband and I went to see Emma Hewitt perform at this night club. We purchased our tickets ahead of time for only 15. This was our first time at this night club and we didn't know what to expect. When we arrived, the staff was really nice and welcoming. The space was small with no seating unless you get a spot outside or purchased a table. The sound system was insane! I felt like the music was going right through my body! Emma's performance was incredible! It felt like she was performing for a private party. I was up front almost the entire night and one of the Security guys let me stand on the stairs next to the stage since I am really short (Lol)! I would love for this venue to have more events because of their sound system. Regarding their drinks, I felt the prices were reasonable- granted I just moved here. I know a lot of folks fr az say this place is pricey. Furthermore, the venue wasn't as packed as I thought it would be- especially with an artist like Emma in the house. No one was really buying drinks either which made it easy and fast to get drinks when we did. Overall, I had a great time mostly due to seeing Emma perform. I even got pictures with her!!!! How crazy is that?! I look forward to other events they hold here!",1
"Wow. Just finished breakfast here. What a treat. Sausage gravy with the best homemade biscuits. MmmAnd best of all we met the owner, Nick, who greeted us at the door. Then came over and shared his story.  Don't miss this place if you're in Las Vegas.",1
Best shop around. The owner is a pimp. Has everything from Zippos to baggies. A jewel in the rough.,1
"My family has been eating at Nicky's Thai Kitchen long before the rest of Pittsburgh discovered it and you needed a reservation to get in here on the weekends. They recently opened another downtown location but the Western Avenue Nicky's will always hold a special place in my heart, especially in warm weather when the Zen Garden around back is open for dining with it's beautiful foliage, Buddhas, and trickling water fountains. You forget you're on the Northside!Nicky's seafood dishes have won my heart over the years so much that I pretty much order whatever seafood dish is on their specials list. In the summer it's often Seafood Phad Cha and I'm always delighted to see that because its my favorite one ever - the sauce is amazing! Their sauces are always so flavorful with lots of fresh veggies & delicious fresh seafood like shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, tilapia and often some crazy corkscrew looking piece of seafood that I can't identify but thoroughly enjoy! Recently the special was Chili Mango Seafood which had a slightly sweeter sauce with the addition of the fresh mango. You can order your preference of heat from 1-10, and I always go 6 - I enjoy a good kick!Since 2 of our family members are vegetarian, we've probably ordered every vegetarian appetizer they offer over the years and they are all delightful. There is often a sampler vegetarian option on the specials menu. You also can't go wrong with the veggie spring rolls or samosas.Nicky's on Western Ave. is also BYOB & typically there's no corkage fee.  Love, love, love Nicky's!",1
"Went for a massage at massage envy and wanted to end our day with a snack, we had the pick two chicken salad and potato cream cheese soup. Both were excellent but we realized a bread bowl would have made it even better so I asked if we could add after we had already started our meal and frank graciously brought us a bread bowl on the house, 5 stars for making our meal even better!",1
this location is very close to my work so as soon as I drove by to eat around that plaza I was so excited that Which Wich would be opening. I couldn't find the date of the opening anywhere so I drove by today and it was open :) Love the toasted sandwiches and love that they have a punch card... I get a free sub on my next visit thanks to today's order!! I was getting sick of eating at Subway so I'm pretty excited there is another sub business open now. It wasn't very packed today for a grand opening so I'm thinking not many people know about it yet. Its located right between Chipotle and a Yogurt shop and Pei Wei.,1
"Pernil (roasted pork) with arroz con gandules( yellow rice n beans) tostones (fried plantains) and potato ball deep fried stuffed with meat, OMG!!!! Stumbled upon this place via yelp. It's amazingly fresh cooked to order hot and delicious. Give it a try. Puerto Rican at it's finest. Topped off with coco rico and goya cola champagane",1
"Great food, Large portions, and fast. Went in on a Monday afternoon with the lunch rush. They had a DJ playing all the feel good r&b jams. This was our first time at LoLo's so we took the first table available which was tucked away in the back corner room. I was asked when I checked in if I would like a table in the main room or the first table available...If I knew better I would have waited a bit longer for a table in the main room so I could listen to the music and people watch. Either way I still enjoyed the feel of the restaurant... And the food was AMAZING!",1
"This place is pretty awesome.The space is very glam and super cozy and the food is delish!I went for happy hour with some friends and ordered their meatballs (our favorite- tender, perfectly seasoned, sauce wasn't too tart or heavy), chicken drumettes (they had a nice crunch with a nice sauce  that was spicy and sweet), charcuterie plate ( 2 meats and 2 types of cheese, grapes, bread), and blistered shishito peppers with lardons (hey it counts as a vegetable, right?). The service was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly. Prices are very reasonable especially during happy hour. Their dinner options look fantastic. The table next to us ordered the smoked ribeye - and we definitely had food envy! The only thing that I didn't care for was the coffee that I ordered at the end of my meal. It was a little on the weak side but did not really dampen the overall experience for me. I'll be coming back for dinner soon and can't wait to try their entrees and desserts!",1
"This place is simply amazing. The best place I've been in Richmondhill, and I highly recommend it to everyone who is a foodie, or not.I first visited couple of months ago, and since it was recalls good, I came back. The service is amazing, all these times I had a very polite, nice, amazing hostess. Food is high quality, fresh and they are very generous. I ordered the avocado salad, which was very nice and it came with generous amount of grated feta cheese. In other places I should always ask for extra cheese or bread, but they also gave 2 types of bread in generous amount, and they both tasted fresh and great (this was on house). When I asked for lemon, they brought me real lemon and unlike other places, I wasn't given super dry, bitter lemon or lime wedge! LolCabbage rolls was the best I had in Canada so far, because it was very fresh!!!Last time I also had the straganof which was very tasty. The decor, the ambiance, and the music was awesome! Staff are super nice and all together it's an amazing restaurant!Give it a try , you won't be disappointed",1
"I'm really impressed by this awesome venue! I'm from Cali... I've never seen such a unique place to hangout, eat, drink and play golf ! The set up is amazing, feels like ur in a sky deck. I enjoyed being here, I would totally look forward to homing again on my next visit!",1
The best in the business. London is super detail oriented and a perfectionist. I'm very picky of my fades and I would never trust anyone else. Book with him and you won't regret it!!,1
"I recommend this place to anyone who needs a CPA, as I am starting my new small business they were so helpful with all my questions and when the guy (Trent, I think) didn't know he brought in his office manager who was a pro at state questions. I seriously appreciated their help so much as I had gone to SCORE offices and small business support groups and non could answer my questions!! I'm thankful that they were able to give me advice and answer my questions. They will be the CPA I use as my business gets started!! Highly recommended!",1
"Amelie's pretty much just serves up amazingness on a plate. Hands down one of the best bakeries that I have been too. Everything I tasted was delicious. My favorite was the bread pudding, as it is absolute greatness. Once you order it, they finish cooking the bread pudding for another 10 minutes so that it is delivered to your table tasting fresh out of the oven. The strawberry vanilla cake was good also(be sure to let it get to room temp before eating). I'm definitely a fan of Amelie's and will definitely be back whenever I'm in Charlotte.",1
"Nice atmosphere. Went there for lunch for our first visit and the food was great! My steak salad was cooked to perfection (really) and my dates chicken wrap was fresh and very flavorful! Both plates were seriously good! But the highlight of the meal was our crazy good service provided to us by Jennifer. Her consistent attention, charm and professionalism was that of what you would expect to receive at a 5-start restaurant. You guys have someone special on your staff. Great job Jennifer!! We will be back to try their dinner menu real soon!!",1
"This place is amazing! The new layout is perfect for a high quality salon, and the prices are absolutely affordable. ATTENTION: please disregard past reviews. Kim never worked there, the tools are 100% disinfected and sterilized before every use, and in case you didn't know CHEESE GRATERS ARE USED TO REMOVE CALLUSES. If you're not comfortable with cheese graters, you can ask them not to use it (but I recommend you do if you have bad heels, mine have gotten better because of the dead skin removal.) I would recommend this place to anyone!",1
Convenient. Coffee are strong and not watered down. Ice mocha is great and not too sweet. You can also order a breakfast sandwich with your coffee which I usually do when I'm running late for work while being both sleepy and hungry!,1
Just received a delivery order. The food was hot and fresh. The crab wontons were delicious. Pork fried rice had tender big pieces. Orange Beef was amazing. Slightly spicy and nicely crisp. Will order again soon.,1
"Finally made it to Cafe Monarch.  It was as good as you've all said.  Wonderful atmosphere and the food was ahhhmazing.  Chris is very relaxed and you feel like you are a guest in his home.  I couldn't understand why the open kitchen wasn't a mess?  It was spotlessly clean.  The restaurant itself was charming and hip.  The braised ribs fell off the bone when you tried to pick them up.  I've never ever had anyhing that tender before.  The fried catfish.....delicious. The polenta, even my husband with texture issues said, ""wow, it's addicting"".   The appetizer was a bed of some sort of delicious greens and black eyed peas, topped with a huge slice of a perfect tomato and a cut of goat cheese.  The flavor combination was out of this world.  We both ate every bite.  The dessert was simple but elegant.  Fresh whipping cream, strawberries, a puddle of chocolate and puffed pastry sticks that he readily told us how to make.  He is so kind.  It was definately a 'dining' experience. ...... 2 hours.  We were getting a bit antsy just towards the end and only because we had our child with someone.  No one else was budging, even ones that had been there longer then us.  I thought the prie-fix pricing was low for what we got.  Things like the sprig of mint and a big berry in our water glass that was not only beautiful but delicious!  Considering that he is literally the only person working there, the service is fabulous.   Our water was always filled.  When dusk came we received a darling oil lamp to light our table.  Although the lighting on the porch/patio was perfect anyway.  We brought white wine so an old milk barrell with a beautiful terra cotta urn came to the the table to keep it cool.  The hip thing was that that table next to us had a wood milk crate and an urn brought for them.  The crate was turned to be open towards them and Chris put a candle down in the bottom of it and it was so hip.  He's definately got a nack for ambiance and cool. Most definately a wonderful anniversary dinner.",1
Would give 6 stars if I could! Wife and I went here for dinner for our 6th wedding anniversary and everything we ate was delicious. Max was our server and did a great job providing insight to the menu and what was good. Every recommendation was great and so tasty. We will definitely be going back to try the Sunday brunch!,1
"I love upscale dining but I love my bean and cheese burrito more. The best, next to my mom's homemade burritos. #imstilljennyfromtheblock",1
"I am always satisfied after leaving Cambod-Ican Kitchen! I pretty much always have to get the crispy noodles with shrimp and chicken, and the seafood won tons. And I always put the moun sauce and roasted red pepper flakes on everything. Anyone I know who has ever been here loves it. The restaurant is family owned and operated, with mother and son in the kitchen, and father and daughter in the front. Sometimes they have extra help, but it is usually pretty slow. And very casual, with a decor that reflects this. It's also BYOB. The only drawback is trying to find a parking space near this section of Carson Street.",1
"I was a little apprehensive given the overall average rating was only 3ish stars ...but my fridge was adamant about attending their Halloween Bash and the concierge says the best option would be to do dinner then club ...All that said, my concerns were unfounded.  The food was divine!!  We started with the Lobster Spring Rolls which were delish ...the Sea Bass truly is one of the best things I've ever eaten (apparently that's their sig dish) but the shut yo minute dish was the Coconut Shrimp.  Huge shrimp in this crispy coconut coating was beyond yummy ...We finished with the Fortune Cookie which is much much more than a cookie!! Full and a wee bit tipsy we went through the gyrations to get into the club (why so many stamps and check points??) Party if was!!! Really amazing costumes. Great music. A place to stand or Dance.  Best of five clubs we visited!",1
"Love House of Tricks.   Been here many times for lunch.  Took some out of town guests here for dinner.  As usual, they did not disappoint.   We started with drinks,  I had the Lavender Dog, so good.  It was so good others ordered one after they finished their first drink.( Would love to have the recipe).  I ordered the Pork Chop very tender,  full of flavor  and the bitter brussel sprout leaves were a great counter balance to the sweet tart chutney.  One person got the Mahi Mahi,  she loved it.  The other at the table got the Filets and again they all enjoyed it very much.  We ended the night with night caps,  I got the Toasted....excellent.  Thank you House of Tricks for always making meals so wonderful.",1
"Every year I'm in AZ for thanksgiving and always make a stop in here at buzz boys. Great cuts, great atmosphere and they know how to blend a fade. Good enough for recruiters... good enough for me! Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed, straight edge and a hot towel, can't beat it!",1
"They have new owners and you can tell. I usually only went here when it was convenient while shopping, but I love the new owners and have had the best shellac nails every time. I've had pedi's too and they have always been great no matter who I had.",1
This place was very nice and clean. We came in at 8:30pm and they close at 9pm and they still treated us as if we were the first customers. Yhe massage was great we had the Thai massage was excellent. I will definitely be a continued customer!,1
"NOM! NOM! cute little place..aka as the ""GSpot""..a little spendy..good for a drop-in after a date night!",1
"Really great experience staying at this hotel. We got a suite size room, even though we booked a regular one. The room was huge with a view of the rooftop pool. Sweet!Two things I look for in a hotel: clean room and comfortable bed. The others do not matter to me. I am not going to live there, I am just visiting. Give me a clean room where I can fall asleep quickly and I am a happy man.We stayed here for 4 days/ 3 nights. Excellent location, close to Mount Royal. The bar downstairs was nice and room service was prompt. It is close to public transit, downtown, and all the trendy stores.The rooftop pool is amazing...and they offer you cucumber and lemon water to quench your thirst.",1
For my money one of two or three best Mexican restaurants in the valley. Work downtown eat lunch out 5 days a week. Always go here at least once a week. Some of the best green and red chili I have ever had. Also great beans made with bacon grease. Also has menudo and posole which are wonderful. Try this joint do not let the appearance or location scare you a way.,1
"My favorite place in Cleveland!! I stop here every time I'm in town. It's so fun to stroll around and see the food at each booth. You can buy stuff you'd buy at a grocery store here: fruit, veggies, meat, fish, etc, but there's also a whole bunch of food stands to eat too! I LOVE the gyro place ($11 for a huge gyro that can fill 2 ppl), the crepe shop (~$8 for sweet or savory crepes), and Picadilly's creamery (~$6 for liquid nitrogen ice cream). Come walk around and buy what you want!",1
Tasty burgers and sandwiches..Staff were super friendly including the owner..I was just visiting the area and found this place yelp and thought would give this place a try..highly recommended!,1
It doesn't get much better then this place awesome food awesome drinks awesome environment come during happy hour and try the margarita with the coronita,1
"It's my pleasure to give this Chick-fil-a a five star review! I've been to this location several times since it's close to both my work and home and have had positive experiences every time. The level of customer service received is above and beyond their competitors.Personally, I'm a fan of the spicy chicken sandwich, waffle fries, chicken tortilla soup, chicken egg and cheese bagel and to be honest just about every single thing on the menu haha (I don't eat mANY salads and/or wraps). This location does get busy during lunchtime so think about planning ahead and placing your order on the chick-fil-a app.",1
"Great spot! The ladies are friendly and took their time with my pedicure. My moms pedicure turned out fabulous, paint and all. Clean facility. Clean restroom. Prices are good too.",1
Nick is best at his job. He can easily do your service without interupting your day. He will schedule to let you know when he will come and service your home. Highly recommended!!!,1
"Great experience overall!My husband and I got married at the Wynn's Primrose Courtyard on Aug 30, 2014, and it was a wonderful experience. We had about 50 guests. Our wedding specialists, Kabbie and Sheena, were very helpful and always got back to us with answers to our questions. The venue was beautiful, but most of all we didn't have to do much planning. The whole ceremony was so well organized and everything flowed smoothly. Richard the officiant was incredibly professional and performed the ceremony the way we wanted.The bouquet and boutenniere that came with the package were beautiful.We had a friend play guitar during the ceremony and they accommodated him with a mic and everything. I wasn't sure if the ceremony would be worth the cost, but now having been through it it was definitely worth it. All of the guests said how beautiful and intimate it was. I would definitely recommend the Primrose Courtyard for your ceremony.",1
"Heirloom is a hidden gem and a top five restaurants in Charlotte. It is rich in flavor and will make you want to go search for the recipes to try to make them yourself . I truly enjoy knowing they support local businesses aspect of cooking with local ingredients. This farm to table didn't disappoint us at all. I believe if you are not use to tasting real food you may have a problem with the taste as it may have different textures than highly processed foods. It may have been the night we came but everyone was on their ""A"" game as the food was delicious and service was insightful because every meal was explain very well. We did the tasting of six courses and full disclosure if you are hungry this is enough for two people. I would recommend doing the tasting to share and get two to three sides instead of another entree to split as well. Since we did the tasting and a meal to share I literally walked out of there having to take a button down on my shirt to allow myself to expand. We shared the fried chicken entree with Mac and cheese and slaw. The Mac and Cheese was definitely good and creamy! The tasting was great as my favorite in the tasting was the braised duck and soup. We were told the tasting changes each night so it gives each person a unique experience each time. We enjoyed every dish from the salad to the dessert! I can't wait to come back and try even more flavorful, fresh and truly unique masterpieces! I think you will find this in your top five too.",1
"The sushi was amazing.  Can't decide which one was our favorite They are all fabulous.  Our service staff, Lauren, was exceptional.  she was very attentive and friendly.",1
"Stopped in tonight for the first time. We had the Chicken Pho, which I have to mention was white meat and very hot. As well as, fresh Shrimp Spring Rolls. Both items were delicious! We were probably the last customers in and were met with great customer service by both the host and the server. We even got to meet the owner(who is from Chicago), who stopped to ask us how our meal was. We enjoyed the modern atmosphere! It will definitely not be our last visit.",1
Nice place for salads and juices. They appear to be and taste fresh. My favorite is Thai curry with chicken. You can make your own or get their creations with or without any modifications. It is always packed so that's a good sign.,1
"I've had a consistently great experience here. From the front staff to the hygienists to the doctor himself I have always felt comfortable and taken care of. After not being able to see a dentist for ~10 years, they've really eradicated and/or helped my issues immensely!",1
"We happened upon this great place while in town. Unfortunately, we were in Phoenix due to family illness and it's proximity to St. Joseph's Hospital. There isn't much in the area to choose from but that's not why it got high marks. The staff was perfect, kind and accommodating. Service was A+. The food was really outstanding. We ate there three days in a row. Yep. Every dish was a winner. Put it on your list, they got it going on!",1
"Amazing customer service and great job replacing my bumper. Emily was fantastic to work with. They ordered the bumper, painted it and then got the job done in only a few hours where the other place I got a quote from would've kept my car overnight. When I went to pick it up, I was greeted by the owner and he made sure I was happy with the job they'd done. I would definitely recommend them!",1
"The manager, Melissa, was amazing. So professional, so gracious, and she took excellent care of my friend and me. Thank you so much! Also her suggestion of the Peruvian Doughnuts was a great one, perfectly-paired with our Samba Split (only the most amazing banana split ever created--seriously, caramel popcorn!!!). Big thumbs-up to their pastry chef, Jai, as well. Melissa might have shepherded us to our dessert choices with poise and class rarely found in a Las Vegas establishment, but Jai's care with the preparation of our sumptuous desserts was nothing shy of brilliant. He really raised the bar with his flawless presentation of both desserts. Beautiful, indulgent, simple, crafty. He allowed the dishes to speak for themselves, and they spoke loudly. In my mouth!  He even came to greet us personally.  And I'm pretty sure there was an extra scoop of ice cream in there. Kudos to the Sushi Samba staff for all their excellent service this evening!!! Thank you!!",1
"This is one of my favorite middle eastern markets in the phoenix, every time I'm Scottsdale and Tempe area i can count on them for low prices and high quality.  Its just a great spot with fresh meats and a full-service restaurant and a grocery store to fill your fridge with fresh fruits, deserts and whatever else your pretty little heart desires.  One stop and you can have all you need for the week.  A++ value and quality",1
"My favorite go to neighborhood bakery! The bread and pastries are always phenomenal and the staff are always sweet. I've never had anything I didn't like there, except for their soups (they aren't my favorite). The salmon sandwich is always super yummy!!",1
"Finally, I made it to Omei! Omei provided close to, if not, the best tasting dim sum I had in a long time.  All dishes included ample yummy shrimps. Service was good. Decor was average. First impression is 4 stars. But the amazing taste bumps this up by 1 notch to 5 stars.",1
"Just came back from breakfast here and all I can say is wow! Its our first time here and I am sorry I didn't try it sooner. Ive driven past countless times and it is very misleading. Its an unassuming building that is easily missed. It almost looks vacant sometimes. Today changed all that. My daughter stated many times that she wanted to check it out but it always looked closed. Even this morning as we pulled in she said, ""wait. Is it open?"" The outside is no indication of what awaits you inside. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful and very cozy. Its fairly large and spacious with big comfy booths. I loved it straight away! But the best thing is the menu. There are so many choices with interesting dishes. I had the Summer Crab Omelet which was cooked to perfection. No browned crispy egg here...phew! It had lots of fresh crab and perfectly crisp, not mushy veggies. It was different and so good! My daughter loved hers too. The potatoes are to die for. Seriously everything...the toast, strawberry jam, the coffee. Just excellent!Our server was so pleasant and efficient. It was one of the best restaurant experiences ever. If you haven't yet, just go. You wont be disappointed!",1
"This location is super nice! The salesman here are so professional, the managers are attentive and I had good experiences with everyone I talked to. I bought a car from Josh and he was overall just so helpful, he made the first time buying process understandable, he knew a lot about all the cars and let me basically ask him a thousand questions. I'm really happy with my car and I would definitely recommend this location if you're looking for affordable, relient cars.",1
"We love this neighborhood Mexican food, great breakfast burritos, dinners and nice staff.",1
"Great new menu love the Firestone pita with hummus ,  also the lamb sliders are to die for . They also have a new cocktail menu I had the Arcadia oasis was very very good",1
"Dr. Goodell is a great doctor, and I would highly recommend her. My previous doctor had retired a while back, and I had not had an exam in a long time. So I went to see Dr. Goodell a few months ago as a new patient. As it turned out, I had some extreme issues, so much so, that it was necessary to schedule a surgery asap. I was a bit nervous because I had not established a comfortable relationship with her and now she would soon be cutting me open. I decided to stick with her anyway, and I am so glad I did. She made the whole experience as easy as it could possibly be. My hour and a half surgery turned into 4 hours due to my extreme condition and massive complications. But, she preformed the surgery well, she kept my family informed, and regularly visited and updated me while I was recovering in the hospital. During my follow up office visits she spent plenty of time with me, and patiently answered all of my questions and truly listened to my concerns. I was back on my feet in no time, and I feel better than ever. I will continue to go see her for all of my needs. Oh, and she also managed to save some very necessary internal organs of mine that I wasn't even aware were in jeopardy. For that, I can never repay her.",1
Dr tanita and staff were amazing. The receptionist  were super pleasant. Office was clean. I was running a little late but they still got me in and out within an hour. I felt very comfortable with him and his nurse. I will be making my daughter an appointment with him as well.,1
"Took our pastor and his wife there this weekend. Wonderful and they loved the coffee. I am gluten free but can do the Papa K with ham, egg and Buckwheat.  Highly recommended.",1
"It's a hot 110 degrees out and one of the best things to do is hit up La Flor De Michoacan!Their artisinal ice cream flavors are not like anywhere else, and their agua frescas are much better than Cardenas IMHO...We stopped in and it was packed as usual. Amazingly this time though, I didn't get any ice cream( I always get pine nut, mamey, and avocado) I just got their biggest cup of Alfalfa Agua Fresca.(Stop making those ""yuck"" faces!) It actually tastes ALOT better than it sounds, kinda like cucmber and citrus...stop in if you're in the area and wanting to cool down, you'll be glad you did!...ALOHA!!!YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(320/365) ""Try The Green Water!""",1
"The kebabs of Anatolia Cafe are just perfect. Juicy, tender, served hot and tasty. The servers are awesome and the location in Lee road is perfect. There's parking in the back or across the street behind Phoenix coffee.I'm definitely coming back for the kebabs as I was skewered with delight. True story.",1
"BEST Greek restaurant in Vegas!!! Food quality is excellent! Try everything on the menu and you won't regret it. Always excellent customer service by the Owner and his crew. I highly, highly, highly recommend this place to everyone!",1
"At the end of a long day and you want some great food in the neighborhood stay away from the chains and visit  locally owned Auslers Grill.  The daily specials truly are, do yourself a favor and enjoy one.",1
Called at 7am and got a technician out by 945am. Nick called me before leaving to verify address. He explained to me what product I had and what usually happens to them over time. Very knowledgeable and informative. Took him less then 30min to complete changing the sprockets and gears.,1
Delicious!!!! Best Spring Rolls Ever....Service and Presentation Excellent.Sushi At It's Best,1
"Ambiance, service and food are stellar.  Happy this place opened and I will continue to frequent it.  The menu is amazing.  Im big on sushi and this is the best all you can eat place in town.  Thanks guys.  Ps. Don't go to Sushi mom down the street they're ignorant and act like it's the customers pleasure to be in their establishment.  Sea Salt is the new spot from now on.  They're very welcoming and it's their pleasure you're there.  Love this place.",1
"I'm not a vegetarian but that really doesn't matter at this joint. It's all about the noodles and fresh vegetables. They do make a variety of vegetarian protiens like duck, shrimp and beef and they're pretty good. But the real hero is the seasoning and the sauces. I especially like the soups. My favourite dish is they're version of Singapore noodles, Also they mixed veg and noodles. Great place. Bring cash, there's no debit.",1
"May-yo-boy eat there again. I almost gave it four stars because everybody else did, but I gave it 5.",1
"Let's just say if you want authentic Italian food, go here now! Amazing! The staff is fantastic, the food is so fresh! Feels like your at your Italian grandmas house. Incredible!",1
Jewel and her staff are the best!  We've been using Copy Works for lost dog flyers and posters. The prices are very reasonable and turnaround time is fast. I definitely recommend this place.,1
"I don't eat Italian much, however had an opportunity to stop in for Easter, and now I'm almost kicking myself for not visiting this fantastic Place sooner! They have a wonderful patio setting that had live music, all of the staff is super attentive, and I even had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was completely dialed in and make sure that we were serviced perfectly! Now about the food. I had the London broil which you have to give a try if you're in; it was pretty fantastic with a hint of Rosemary and other spices that made it absolutely delectable. I chose a side of pasta with a white sauce that in my opinion was one of the best white sauces I had ever had. Most white sauces tend to be a little bit runny and lacks in regards to substance, but this one was absolutely perfect, it was very delicious and almost in a way thick,  just like a perfect Italian white sauce should be.  For drinks, I tried the Italian Margarita, which packs a really great punch with a delicious agave tequila over the top that was not overripe but definitely a major part of the drink. It was perfectly Blended alongside the limoncello that they use as part of the margarita. Although I didn't take advantage of the brunch menu, they have a great brunch menu that includes the very rare Monte Cristo which I absolutely have to try the next time I'm out there. All in all with the owner being so passionate about making sure every customer was taken care of, food that was just absolutely perfect, and drinks that were made extremely well and with live music to boot, there is literally nothing that can be said that would be a negative for this great location on the west side! Definitely one of my stops the next time I want to grab a gourmet meal!",1
"Absolutely delicious every single time we go! No matter what we get, the food is top quality, so flavorful and satisfying. Tonight I had the salmon taco with the rice and bean plate.... I don't know what they put in their beans, but I am completely addicted to them! And the salmon taco was so exactly perfect - juicy, flavorful, and the mango salsa is the perfect pairing with it!I already can't wait to go back",1
"I really don't like going to movies, but going to the Globe makes it bearable for me. Great staff & good films! $5 Tuesday's! no annoying ads to sit through & comfortable-enough seats. Snacks are cash only & there's no ATM! so come prepared with cash, or a flask & a granola bar in your purse!",1
"I dine here once or twice a year and always pleased with experience.  The food is excellent and locally sourced as a bonus.  Atmosphere is relaxed not pretentious - the focus is the food.  Not a place to be seen like King West, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  The menu is simple but should have something for everyone.My main was the Duck 2 Ways and started with the Smoke Trout Garden Salad.  The salad had nice contrast in flavours.  The duck didn't disappoint but the croutons were an odd addition.  Wine list is short but covers all the bases - nothing extravagant (we ordered the Barbera). Don't expect Grand Cru Burgundy.  The service is good not spectacular but appropriate for the price point.Overall, good value for great food.  I know why it is not easy to get reservation as you need to book about 2 weeks in advance for prime times.",1
I am a sucker for frozen yogurt.  Even more so when it's a frozen yogurt place close to my home.  They do not have as many flavors as some of the other chains out there but the flavors that they do carry are all excellent.  The also have a great variety of toppings- which is fun.  They are known for the flizzard!  I love it- its basically a blizzard (think dairy queen) but with frozen yogurt and all the toppings of your choice!  No more eating all of your toppings first- you can mix them all throughout your froyo combo.  Just make sure you choose yogurt flavors that go well together!  Decently priced and they offer a stamp card too so all of your trips here will pay off!,1
"This place is excellent! The food was great, was a bit of a wait, we went at about 10 am and by the time we left it was packed and for good reason! I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken which was so good! the mashbrowns, gravy, and chicken were cooked to perfection. The coffee was smooth and had a great taste. The owner came by to ask how the food was and made us feel welcomed. I will come back and will definitely check out the Summerlin location!",1
"OMG! I love my new quartz countertop. First and foremost the company was wonderful to work with, second, they were extremely professional with any issues and concernsScott and Austin our installers were the best. They were thoughtful for laying drop cloths down (it was snowing) throughout the kitchen and foyer, also very quick, neat, professional and funny too! I had great conversation with Scott and Austin! I truly feel we got the best product for our money! Thank you again Stoneworks!",1
Excellent donuts.  As good as you are going to find.  The only negative is that dont have donuts all of the time.  When they are fully stocked...its gonna be a good day.,1
"Service was excellent Food was delicious I ordered Chicken Kabob , Tabouleh, Hummus - everything was clean, food delicious and service on point- I will be back soon",1
"This is a great place.  Good atmosphere, tacos, drinks, and prices.  On Tuesday tacos are only $2.00.",1
"Love popped! Just popped in , lol and got stellar service and goodies for work for the Sales Team!",1
"This has been the best pool building experience. I have built several pools with other builders in the valley but Xterior Creations is by far the best to work with. They are courteous, professional, and punctual. They communicate better than any pool builder that I have ever encountered. This is true from the beginning to the end. Thank you Xterior Creations staff!",1
"Have pasted here many times. Last night was the night to finally stop in for dinner! Oh the smells as you enter the door bring me back to a true East Coast Italian restaurant!! Seated in a booth and started with Cocktails. Our server Melanie was so fun and attentive. Made awesome suggestions.... that didn't disappoint. Appetizer of Eggplant Rolatini.  I could have had this as my dinner. Delicious! Dinner... I had Rigatoni Bolognese. Meaty and just so good. Husband had Baked Ziggy(Ziti)... she recommend it "" loaded"". Sure. So meatballs and sausage added. Well needless to say..... fantastic. Brought back home enough for a meal today!! Can't wait to go back. I'm sorry we didn't go sooner!!",1
"We recently used ACSI for the inspection of our new home. Our inspection was done by Tim who did a very thorough job. He also walked us though all the main issues and took the time to explain everything, and recommended a few inexpensive easy fixes. After we moved in I noticed that a 4 way switch wasn't working at our stairs. With all the hassle of moving, I didn't think much of it. After living there for a month it was a big nuisance to not be able to have a light to walk up the stairs at night. Last week I got an email from ACSI asking if I was still pleased with my inspection, and for the record overall I was. I called them and asked if there was anything that could be done b/c I felt the inspector should have found the switches weren't working. They were so helpful, and sent out Dave the next day! He was there promptly at 9am and stayed until the switches were fixed. He even ran to the store and bought a new switch. He was there over 2 and half hours and dealt with my kids jumping over him to get to their rooms. He was AMAZING to stay until the job was done and dealt with all of us in his way. A big thank you to Dave and ACSI for coming out and fixing this for us. It truly is appreciated!!!!!",1
"Great Neopolitan Pizza, Brings back memories of my youth in Naples in the 60's. It even had a sign with the street were I lived on the wall. I had the Margarita Pizza, the classic Neopolitan pie. It was perfecto.",1
"Have been looking for a good pizza since moving here last Nov. Had our first thin crust pizza tonight from Rosati's. It was yummy, plenty of cheese and a great perfectly cooked thin crust, the last thin crust pizza we had here from another pizzeria was burned on the bottom. So we have finally found our pizza place. Loved it!",1
"Even tho this is my first time ever eating at Culver's, I highly recommend their sourdough burger melt -- so good it melts in your mouth! And a shake... Can't go wrong with a shake!",1
"This is my favorite restaurant. Not just for Ethiopian, but my overall favorite restaurant. Very affordable and just really delicious food. I would eat here every week if it were close to my house. I'm very excited that they've started selling some of their dishes at Whole Foods now, particularly my favorites: misir wat, tikil gomen, and fosolia.",1
Great sushi quality! Every time I crave that otoro or blue fin this is the place to go,1
"My son goes here once a week and loves it! He started when he was 14 months old. Louis is an AMAZING instructor and really gets close with the kids. My son adores him. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Don't be discouraged if your first week or two your kids shrieking like a lunatic halfway through. We've all been there, if you stick to it they'll love it, and it'll be so worth it.",1
"I went during their happy hour and really enjoyed it.  They have a a ton of different varieties, the sushi is fresh and light tasting.  The ambiance is inviting, the happy hour prices are very reasonable, and the servers are attentive.  This will definitely become one of my new favorite dinner spots.",1
"Great job, they came, they worked, they cleaned up and they left!  The workers were courteous, prompt, and knowledgeable. Best prices in town... I would definitely recommend you give them a call.",1
"Great selection of wines by the glass.  Very interesting selection.  Don't be afraid to explore.  They have picked a huge selections of winners.  Lovely food as well.  All small plates. And a great selection of sherry, amaro, even scotch.Come for the wine.Enjoy the food.Friendly helpful staff to boot.",1
You have to try the big ol burrito and there McBegal!! Only downside is the overly priced donuts and pastries.. other then that we love it,1
"We had dinner the night of a bachelorette party and it was great! The food was wonderful, staff was accommodating and environment led us to a night of laughter. Food and drinks were great, I recommend eating the ice cream with the chocolate bar...yum!",1
"FANTASTIC!!!  I was so impressed with this hotel.  the lobby is beautiful and everyone was very friendly.  the room...awesome!  i felt like i was kind of in the rain man suite!  so cool!  the service there is awesome.. the guy who helped with the bags was so nice and helpful and went and got us ice!  the bags came before we could even call and whenever we called for something we had it very quickly. the room was huge, couch, gigantic bathroom (big enough for 4 girls to get ready at the same time), 3 flat screen tvs and one of my friends was so stoked on the full length mirror!  One cool thing...the blinds have a remote...i know..cool right!!!   quick elevators...my only complaint was the nutso prices on bottles of water...crazy!  $3.50 for a bottle of crystal geyser or something....not happening!  I will take any opportunity i have to stay again at the Palazzo.",1
"Went for dinner with a friend, and it was some of the best authentic Korean food I've had in Toronto. In my opinion, the food was better than any Korean restaurant I've been to at Yonge and Finch. This is going to be my new go to spot for Korean food.The portions were very generous and I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.We got the seafood pancake and a bibimbap to share between the 2 of us and it was more than enough food. This place is on the pricier side but totally worth it considering the amount of food we got.",1
Best service from a A/C company Ive ever had. Spoke to Ruby in the office and had someone out within a hour to check the air. The technician explained to me what was wrong in terms that I could understand and had it fixed right away. Definitely my first choice for future service and repairs.,1
This place is awesome. Friendly staff. Eda and Loren are amazing bartenders. The food here is amazing. The kicking cheesesticks and the New Yorker are great. They also have a nice big 5 dollar game day menu. They also are starting a pool league on thursdays. They have a poker league on Tuesday and Friday with games at 6 730 and 9. Sunday poker is at noon 130 and 3. If you into comedy check out Wednesday nights. Liza the owner is very nice and approachable too.,1
I ordered the gyro platter and the meat was well-seasoned and tender. The salad was fresh and the sauces were delicious. Will definitely be back for more!,1
"Best salon in Dormont, if not the city.",1
Very nice staffPlace is never packed - I get in and out,1
"Great BBQ and cheese cake. The portions were so big I couldn't finish it and I'm 6'5"" and 280 I had the pats ponder amazing.",1
"Craving TJ style tacos at 4 AM while on the Vegas strip?  This is the place to be for your taco craving in the City of Sin.  Finally, I found a place in Vegas who serves street tacos and is open after a night of drunken bliss.  We stumbled into there about 4 AM and saw the line pouring outside the door on a Saturday night/Sunday morning.  A crowd mainly comprised of Latin descent and a good mixture of other cultures was a clear indication that this was the place to be for authentic street tacos.  READ THIS PORTION CAREFULLY!!!!!Okay so when you make your approach to the restaurant you need to determine what kind of tacos you want.  From what I remember (I was pretty inebriated), there were three UNIDENTIFIED lines.  Starting from the left as you face the kitchen, line #1 consisted of the carne asada line.  You tell your order to the taco chef but be aware that the designated lines represent the specific type of meat you want on your food.  Line #2 is the adobada line, and #3 is the tripas and cabeza line.  There were other types of meats but I can't remember which line you can get them at.So if you are a taco eating machine like myself, you want to try all the meats strictly for the purposes of providing fellow yelpers a true, well educated opinion on the good and the bad of services provided to the general public, more specifically an educated opinion from me regarding street tacos.  Not to nurse your future hangover in Vegas, because hangovers NEVER happen in the City of Sin.  Unless you only want one type of meat on your tacos, be sure to tacticallly plan your approach to the taco masters and be sure you are in the right line.  Unfortunately we learned the hard way and did not split our resources to different lines.  We ordered the asada tacos and had to fall in the tripas line to score my tripas, cabeza, and adobada  taco fix.  I wasn't  going to fall in the herrendous adobada line, so I worked smarter not harder and had someone much better looking than me who wore heels and had bigger and better goods for these taco guys to look at than my taco eating mug place the adobada taco order even though she was in the tripas line.  Apparently it worked because we scored what we wanted.  Till next time Tacos El Gordo.....We shall meet again and hopefully I won't have to resort to the egotistical motto that women always get what they want and how men use them.",1
"Just wanted to give a quick shoutout to the desk worker named Joya, I had left something at the hotel and after days with little communication she went above and beyond to personally check for me, a big relief, huge thanks to her!",1
Great place!!  So friendly and always able to meet our group needs. Food is always authentic and super delicious. We go often!!,1
Met Pat the owner last night. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Everything was great. MAKE SURE TO GET THE BEANS! The smoked chicken drumsticks that is THEN DEEP-FRIED IS AMAZING. We will defiantly be back!!!!!,1
"This is a nice Chinese restaurant with good food and a friendly staff. I have ordered take out here many times and the food is always ready when I get there, the ingredients are fresh, and the food always tastes good. Another thing I like is they will customize your meal if you ask. I am trying to stay gluten free so as an alternative they offer a white sauce that has no soy sauce or gluten in it. If you are in the mood for Chinese food check them out.",1
"Our first time there, we loved the decor. It looks like a Mexican restaurant with the colors and decorations but they had awesome paintings all over the walls. We ordered a little bit of everything, some we loved, some weren't our favorite. The Best Damn Margarita was one of the best margaritas I've had. The queso was delicious and the quesadilla was my favorite. We would definitely recommend it and will be coming back!",1
"I was only here for weekend  brunch, so I can't rate the dinner or weekday menus. However, my brunch experience was perfect. All of the servers were really nice and attentive, and explained the menu Nd gave great selections. At $10 a platform for brunch, out meal was actually really reasonably priced. I had the corn fritters which came with salad and guacamole and delicious bread and potatoes, and my friend had the pancakes of the day, which were apple Ginger. Everything was sooooo good. And then we had some chocolate mouse fruit creation thing for desert that I can't even begin to describe the yumminess of. Mmm I made myself hungry writing this review.....",1
"I've been here twice and both times have been great! They have quality nursing bras in a variety of sizes.  The owner is awesome!  She helped me figure out the right fit and was so easy to talk to, I felt like I was shopping with a friend!  I definitely recommend it.",1
"I have always lived a healthy lifestyle through sports and would always get bored with LVAC, EoS, or other local gyms. I have stayed committed to PowerHour 360 at the Southwest location for over a year. Even at the busiest times of my life, I have stayed with it 3x a week on average. Chris, Ignacia, and Joe have all been amazingly inspirational and give me the extra push to be committed on those days I feel like being lazy. At 34, I am in the best shape of my life and they have been a MAJOR part in why. I often times hear people say they don't want to spend a lot of money on a gym, but you can't put a price on happiness within yourself. It's worth every penny, I love the high intense workouts and that they are unique everyday. This gym is the BEST I have been to! - Billy Hemberger",1
Trust the reviews! B&B were fantastic in handling my personal injury case after a car accident. No problems/issues whatsoever. Adam was a great help and kept me in the loop constantly.,1
"First time and love this place. Me and my sister were waiting for some family friends to show up for the Disney on Ice show so we decided to wait here. I ordered a medium Chai Latte that costed about $4.50 which isn't bad since it was super delicious, there was lots of froth, for me, I love latte froth/foam. The latte itself wasn't too sweet compared to other places like Second Cup (theirs was too sweet and too expensive) and you actually taste the herbalness (not a word but I don't care). My sister got a cheesecake brownie which was very delicious, a tad bit too sweet for me since I'm more of a savory person.The service was very good. Orders were taken fairly fast but that was a bit of a wait time but that is expected with the latte since the barista had to steep the chai tea leaves first and make everything else for it. The location is fairly good too, it is located conveniently across from the Rogers Centre and fairy easy to locate. I also like the decor, it gives off a nice homey feeling and it definitely made me feel welcomed and at home. Would come back if I'm in the area.",1
Tried this place while visiting Arizona for the time. Love it! The prices are really reasonable for a cute little dessert place! We got taro along with condensed milk and strawberries and mango on the side.,1
"Nicole helped me. Extremely friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu or different kinds of beer. She suggested Hi-Brown Burger and oh I'm so glad she did. It was trilicious!! Side with Garlic fries and a great beer, nothing tops it. Very cool decoration and great ambiance with zillions if large screen TVs showing different sporting events. Folks , this place is really happening.",1
Dang I'm so glad I was referred to Dr. Glicks office a couple years ago. Still so happy with my dental care. Karol gets all those build up areas I can't reach on my wisdom teeth and I feel like my teeth are a smooth as glass after a cleaning. Way to go on the awesome office manager at the front desk. She was amazing and so polite. Handled all my questions and knew all the answers. Just amazing service all around there. I miss Dr Glick though. I hope he's back soon. Best dental office in Nevada!,1
"No complaints about Coffee Bean, they in my opinion are much better taste than Starbucks. They have nice pastries also, but their chai is my go to, and it's not overly sweet.",1
"It's 4th of July, I'm having a party this afternoon, I just called progressive pest control because I found a beehive in my back yard and they are on their way over.  Just response!!",1
"What a gem in the Luxor! Excellent food and good drinks.You don't expect an Egyptian-themed hotel to have a good Mexican restaurant, but Diablo's is very very good. The prices are reasonable, the drinks are good (they have to be in LV to compete!) and the food is excellent. I had the combo enchilada plate and it was very tasty. The enchiladas came with red sauce, green sauce and mole. The presentation was nice and the price was reasonable. The decor is typical of a restaurant in a casino, but it was nice. Fortunately, it's located on the upstairs level so you're not in the middle of the slot machines and smoke, etc. Highly recommended if you're in the mood for some excellent, slightly foo-foo Mexican food in Vegas.",1
"Had an excellent haircut here with Hiro, and the ambience is very cool. They are reasonably priced, and they offer a variety of services including hot towel shaves. Online booking makes things easy, too.As for the cigar shop part of the business, though I'm not a smoker, the cigar shop is certainly unique, and they seem to take a lot of care in selecting their products. I will definitely be returning for a cut again!",1
"I enjoy visiting this lounge more than I do Vegas.Entirely complimentary to members, it has a variety of resting areas from cabrioles, futons, to daybeds.  1 shower, a bathroom, dining area, kids room, conference space, and a workspace corner with desktops.  The best part is the food and drinks!Bfast is served from 6-11A, lunch/dinner thereafter till 11P.  Salad bar with assorted fruits, waffles, and typically 2-3 types of hot food.  Open bar with espresso, tea, and soft drinks.Though unlike other lounges, no bottled non-alcoholic drinks to take with you, and no flight announcements.  The FIDS is also slow to refresh (5-10 mins behind), so I actually missed boarding a delayed flight.Great place to meet interesting folks from all over.To get here, take the tram to D gate and go up the escalator, signs all over.",1
"From the very first call to the installation of our beautiful banner sign, Color Reflections was professional and helpful.   We are a new business and the world of signs and advertising was intimidating.  Jay Castellano made the process very easy.  Our window graphics are gorgeous and we have had a steady flow of customers since the banner and pylon sign went up.  Thank you!!!!",1
"My sister found this beautiful hidden secret in Henderson and I luv them. It's a one stop shop for me, mani-pedi-wax and done. Thank you Mary (=",1
"SO happy I came across this place. Place is clean, staff is friendly. Food is amazing. Street tacos & their Mexican style corn on the cob is everything. Everything I've had is so fresh & delicious. Salsa bar is better than any other place I've been to. Would recommend 10/10.",1
"I had a great first time experience at China Fresh Tea. We were greeted firstly by the owners who I believe are a couple. They introduced several popular drinks to us and asked if we prefer light or darker tasting tea. We ordered the Jasmine Tea with cream (which is lighter) and Carbon Oolong Tea (darker/stronger). Both were great but the Jasmine Tea was reeeaaally good. Although there are many boba shops opened recently in Vegas, I believe China Fresh Tea is very unique and individualistic compared to other boba shops. I love how they use fresh brewed tea and fresh milk. The shop is also beautifully decorated which is a plus! They have free Wi-Fi and spacious tables with plenty of outlets for studying. I will definitely return to try other drinks. 10/10 would recommend.",1
My family and I love love love here.  The people here including food is awesome. The prices are resonable. We have never left here feeling hungry.  DELICIOUS,1
This place is awesome. It has a modern and cultural vibe to it. The food was amazing! I recommend to go for lunch because they always have good deals. Thai tea is only a $1! yummyy,1
"Moving to Vegas I didn't know what to expect, but once I knew there was an undefeated and less than 5 miles away from me, life couldn't get any better adjusting to a new city! The staff literally makes you feel at home, great selection, great sales, highly recommend, can't wait for stussy to open right next door. Vegas is only going to get better!",1
"If you like sports, this place is awesome.  Just got back from watching sunday football at this place from 1pm to 4pm.  On the big screen they will share screentime between different games.  They first had football, then CFL, then raptors, then back to football.  There is a screen everywhere you look.  For us, they had all NFL games playing on at least one tv within view.  The food was okay.  The hot wings were good, but not that hot, and the nachos were decent, but without much toppings.  The service was good and friendly.  We had good seats, but not all seats are within view of the big screen, so I guess experience depends partially on where you sit.This place could be 5/5 if you're a sports fan, but 2/5 if you're not.      Derek",1
"I had read reviews about this place for a while, and had always wanted to go here. Now that I have, I can definitely say that this is something I wish I could frequent. I ordered the ""Dirty"" Milk Tea, which looks pretty ominous, or seems to fit some people's aesthetics (like mine), with the milk tea base and what looks like a black liquid on top that on its own, is very bitter.When mixed however, it is a taste I wasn't expecting, but it's definitely enjoyable. They make their tapioca in house, and i was not expecting to receive numerous colours in the bottom of my cup.Stunning!",1
By far the best selection of reptiles in ontario. Staff is friendly and well educated. Definitely worth checking out,1
"If you are looking for a healthy (Mediterranean) meal Pita Jungle is a great option. Whether take-out or dine in, you won't be disappointed! I live and work close to this location and they know me here. I am a regular diner with them and I highly recommend Pita Jungle!",1
"Had the asparagus quiche and it was so good we had to come back the next day to get it again! Love their salads and sandwiches too. Have not been disappointed yet! Great job to all the ladies working there, always happy helpful people.",1
"Very friendly bunch. Rates were more than reasonable. I don't usually write reviews, but the experience compelled me to do so. In an age where companies only care about the bottom line, this company stands out as a testament of how companies used to be and should be.",1
"Professional, caring, and reasonably priced. Excellent Egg's Benny!! Can't wait to go back.",1
I came to Angelina'a and as soon as I walked in I had the best greeting and I seen two great smile they are hard workers they brought are food at fast it was great I really do consider trying this place,1
"I have been going to the Cinedome for years. Great ticket prices and the best popcorn! I love Cinemark's policy of no little kids in R-rated movies after 6pm. I can't understand parents bringing little one in at anytime to R-movies anyway. They DO have 3D movies! Fancy recliners, NO. Theaters are clean, seat are comfortable for 2-hours. Great customers, for the most part. Jerks, please stay away! Staff is good and cordial. I actually work in many theaters around town and when I am paying, I go to Cinedome!",1
"One of the best Pho in Richmond Hill. Pho is ""pure"" and clean. Speedy service. Expect to wait in line 10-15min when busy.",1
"Hands down consistently the best breakfast in Scottsdale. Incredible egg dishes, incredible pancakes, and incredible coffee. Wait times can be long so go there early, but definitely go there.",1
"My favorite buffet in Vegas so far! Went here for the dinner buffet.Sit in the garden area. It is so pretty and nice. It is kind of like Alice in Wonderland's tea party decor-wise.The food is quite good for buffet fare. The salads that they mix for you have a touch too much dressing on them, but are great. Other good food items - Chinese shrimp dumplings, risotto, bruschetta, shrimps.  The desserts - this is where to spend your calories in this buffet if you have a sweet tooth like mine... The ice cream is excellent. Eat all of the flavors. Put toppings too! Candy apple is quite decent - it looks nice and eating it in the garden area makes it taste better. Lemon meringue thing in a cup = very very good. Strawberry shortcake recon in a cup was also very good. Black forest cake classed up in a neat slice - quite good. Apple crumble is sooo good and warm. Cream puff was so so - I have had better, but eat it anyway, it is not that big. The creme brûlée was not bad either, although the ones in Montreal are way better. Just eat it, since it tastes light and sugary. Crepe is good and ask for ice cream on it. Take a chocolate and sprinkled covered marshmallow on your way out the door because they look cute and are sweet.Mmm. Go to this buffet and eat and eat and eat! Then sit and look at the pretty garden area, sip some tea, and eat eat eat some more. Make an evening out of it!",1
"If you want real Mexican food, you must come here! Best outside of Mexico! Simple choices and best taste.",1
"Got married in '07 and stayed here.  Giving 5 stars because of the view of the Fountain Show.  Remember to turn up the volume of your TV when the show starts. IT IS AWESOME.  Then saw Celine Dion next door at Caesar's Palace so the proximity was great - just walked right over [Paris Hotel is next door too].  The Bellagio has staff that asks for your card at the elevators so security is in place.  The pool is awesome and IIRC, the towels are provided as a courtesy.",1
I was not going to stop but I was too thirsty  for something cold to drink. I found a very polite & handsome young man at the drive through and a truly sweethearted woman who gave me my drink. I used to go here a lot for their $0.59 cones. Very nice McDonald's if you must go to one - they know customer service!,1
"I've been a patient of Dr. Shah's for over two years now and must say, he and his staff have always exceed all my expatiation. Over the past few years, I have gone to many dentist in the Phoenix area prior to seeing Dr. Shah, yet never had a reliable and truthful office experience until I came to Amy Dental.  Dr. Shah an amazing dentist! The  staff at Amy Dental are extremely friendly and always willing to work with around patients schedule. Dr. Shah's genuineness is seen, as he looks at each patients as individuals not a money value. Regardless if you have insurance or not, his office gives comparable pricing to fit anyone's budget. I would recommend Amy Dental to anyone looking for an ethical dentist who actually cares about his patients! Love my teeth and its thanks to Dr. Shah and his staff!",1
"Outstanding.  From the minute we walked in the door until the moment we walked out.  The staff was friendly, attentive and efficient.  We had a big party of friends and family for an engagement on the pier. Doug the manager was excellent and his staff super. Liam was so friendly and provided outstanding service.  The food greatness. Their chips fresh and delicious. The guacamole and queso are a must try. Gracias.  Bravo and thank you.",1
Had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was awesome!! Only complaint is that it took a lite while but it was super fresh!,1
"If I could give Ask Computers 6 stars, I would!!Some context for the issue:I spilled tea onto the keyboard area of my MacBook Air one morning. It was still on (yikes)... I saw the screen flicker until it turned off completely. Panicking, I turned it upside down to try to get more of the liquid out of it and left it for about an hour. I didn't think I spilled too much but I guess I was wrong. Then I took it to the Apple store (3 hours after the initial spill because I had to wait about 1.5 hours for my genius appointment). Though I had Apple Care, it only covers manufacturers' defects and no accidental damage. The Apple genius took one look at my laptop after taking off the back cover, and told me that liquid got on all the major components of the hardware. Almost all of it would need replacing he said. He quoted me $100 more than the cost of a brand new MacBook Air (uh... what?! In what world would someone pay the same price as a brand new computer, just so that they can get it replaced with other computer parts that may or may not be refurbished). I didn't trust Apple... I knew they were not in the business of repairing computers. I was so disappointed because they could have at least tried to help me out (I'll explain below). Sooooo, I stashed my laptop in a ginormous bag of rice for a few days (didn't help though). Apple made me feel like my computer was damaged beyond repair. ------------------------------------------------Actual review:I emailed Ask Computers about my problem, asking if they could take a quick look at my computer (I sent them a photo) and deem if it was at all repairable. They replied very quickly, and after a couple of emails, told me to come in so they could assess the extent of the liquid damage. They told me to disconnect the battery (and how) in order to increase the chances of my computer being repaired. Apple couldn't even do this for me when they opened up my laptop to assess the damage...????  Gives me the impression that if the Apple guy had found a puddle of liquid in my computer, he'd just close it up without trying dab it dry or something. The following day, I dropped off my laptop for Ask Computers to assess the damage and provide a quote for me. Whilst at the store, they took off the back of the laptop to take a quick look and provided me with an approximate price range. The man who primarily helped me, Max, said he'd call me with the quote. It was way way WAY less than Apple's ridiculous quote (plus, Apple needed 10 business days to rip me off). Max said he'd be able to repair it for the next day. So, I went ahead with the repair service and picked up my laptop the next day. It was pretty much as good as new!!! Hallelujah. The repair service also came with a 60-day warranty.------------------------------------------------TLDR; I listened to other Yelpers and they did not lead me astray! You can trust this place to fix your electronics and put the customer first. They also sell other computer/phone accessories.Thank you Max and everyone at Ask Computers! You guys run a great business. Thanks for the honest and efficient service!",1
"I live in Las Vegas, but have never taken one of the many helicopter tours the area has to offer. My mother was visiting from Florida so we booked a sunset tour of the Las Vegas strip. The airport was very easy to locate and park. The office staff was very friendly and professional.  We were given clear precise instructions and felt very safe. I cannot say enough about the helicopter ride. It was incredible!  Even though I have lived in Vegas for 10 years I felt as though I were seeing it from a whole new perspective. My mother also had a wonderful time and was very grateful. I will recommend 702 helicopters to visiting family and friends!",1
"I love coming here for some healthy grocery shopping, a quick lunch, or to pick up dinner to bring home.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I also like that they have a huge selection of already made food to make the most of my lunch break.",1
"Beautiful salon, really friendly staff. Awesome idea to have a boutique and salon in one. Would recommend, thank you!!!",1
"Great company. Todd has a top notch team, which is a reflection on his leadership. They're the most honest company I have ever come a crossed. My units are now over 20 years old and still going thanks to preventive maintenance by Black Mountain Air. Thank you guys!!+",1
"Delishness! We orders everything hot n juicy favor medium, Cajun calamari, & 3 sides of rice. 2 lbs of Manila clams, lb of mussels, lb of shrimp, and king crab legs. Everything tasted amazing! Their sauce was just the right amount of Cajun, garlic, sweetness, and spice. And it compliments soooo well with rice! Cajun calamari was fresh and perfectly crisp and a hint of Cajun. I sprinkle lemon on top and always ask for a side of tartar. That's how I like it! Gloves, bibs, lemons, salt & pepper, & great service from Jared were also included. This was my father's first time here & he wished there were a Hot n Juicy where he's from. If he wasn't traveling back home today, he would've packed the sauce. Most def be back!",1
"Can't go wrong, especially when I'm in the mood for craft beer. Service is not as good as the  bar or kitchen.",1
"I just had my first facial with Kristin, and it won't be my last! She is professional, yet personable, and extremely knowledgable about skin. She addressed my concerns without trying to promote her own line of products (this was a first!) and was very thorough! Best of all my skin came out glowing, and she gave me some fantastic skin tips!

Best Italian food outside of Italy itself. Beautiful ambience and lovely service and a friendly smile.,1
"I brought my husband to Brindley's to select a new guitar for his birthday.  From the time we walked in both Bruce and Gabe were very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.   Bruce help my husband decide on the right guitar for him by selecting several different guitars explaining the pros and possible cons of each one, then letting him play each one.  Talk about personal service!Once my husband selected a beautiful Ibenez hollow body, Bruce offered to change the strings and check it all out again in 30 days.  My husband is very happy with his new guitar and extremely pleased with our experience with Brindley's Music.",1
"For something I thought was going to be boring, cheesy and not worth the money, I am so happy I was proven wrong!  I'd never been to a wax museum and this exceeded my expectations!  The fact that you got to touch the figures I had no idea!  I heard that the one in NYC didn't allow that and everyone was behind velvet ropes.  That made it even better!  We took pictures with literally every single figure!  I mean, when's the next time I can hug up on a topless Jenna Jameson!?  Angelina and Brad nearby?  I was in heaven!  So many photo ops and so much time!  Well worth the money - and you can get coupons out of any tourist guide that your hotel or cab has!",1
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!! Got my car beautifully clean inside AND outside in minutes! Will definitely come back and recommend.,1
"Love this place so much. One of my trips to YC'S was almost a disaster for me because I decided to experiment with my sauces and accidentally made my sauce too hot for me to eat. When the server walked by she asked how the food was and I hesitantly said ""it's really spicy"" and she immediately offered me another metal bowl to make start a new dish. I was eternally grateful because my food would have gone to waste and I hate wasting Ycs or anything really. Definitely gonna continue to love these guys :)",1
"This place is for UBE lovers! Even if you're not an ube lover, you will find something to your liking! I only had the ube monster with boba and I enjoyed it . Wish there wasn't that much cookie crumble in it.My husband and I split the Turkey pesto. It tastes better than starbucks'. Wish they had some choices of Filipino food to snack on hoping they'll add stuff in the future.Other dessert I tried were the ube crack crumble and the ube flan. The crack crumble was better than the ube flan! However, they were both good. Ube flan tastes like a purple puto cupcake with flan on top.Will be back and I'll try the halohalo next!!",1

I'll start off by saying a am not a very easy person to please. I provide good customer service myself being a plumber so I deal with people everyday and do everything I can to make sure they are happy. This is how I am treated when I come to genos. Guaranteed good food and cold beer. Perfect he TVs to look at with all your sport channels just to top the cherry off. Thank you guys. You rock,1
Walked in bright and early at 7 & was treated extremely well by waitress Jasmine! Food was delicious and was quick to come out. Great experience all around,1
"The fifth star is really for the hours. Till midnight!I had been to this place before, not realizing they did passport photos, because they're in the Presse International magazine shop. After trying (and failing) to get my photos done over lunch at Shoppers Drug Mart (where apparently no one knows how to use a camera), I came here because it's open late and I was busy till 9. The guy made sure I was up to Passport standards (no hair in face, no sunglasses on head, etc.) and took a few photos before he got one he was satisfied with. Handed in my application this morning and they were satisfied with the photos as well, which is all that really matters. Would not be getting my passport in time to travel if it was not for this place!",1
Jackie was so helpful today at the craziness that was the 7 for $27 sale! Thank you :),1
"Great pizza! Needed to call to discuss food allergies. Friendly and helpful customer service! Both pizzas we had were delicious. The free breadsticks were plentiful, tasty, and soft. Online ordering was easy; delivery service was efficient and friendly. Enjoy!",1
"This is my favorite place to get coffee in Pittsburgh by quite a large margin. The location (which is in the process of moving about 50 feet) is in the heart of the strip, and is a great place to kick off an adventure on a weekend morning in the strip. The baristas are extremely knowledgeable about the drinks and show tremendous skill in making them. Always willing to share knowledge about the different types of coffee and best methods of preparation/consumption. Especially considering they serve ""traditional"" beverages (as opposed to what Starbucks has led us to believe..), the customer education is paramount and they take it very seriously. If I could offer some advice, don't add any milk or sugar to this coffee. The baristas are very good at understanding each customer's beverage preferences (more/less milk, flavor profiles, etc.) and tailoring drinks to their needs. It's a great place to go to get educated on coffee or just enjoy a great beverage. 21st Street is the best in all of the city.",1
F yeah!  This place rules.  Curry is amazing.  Even if you choose a meat they load it with vegetables.  Nice serving size.  The Thai Basil and Ginger are also good menu options.  Yum.  Lunch special is really well priced without compromising quality.  Love them.,1
"I had never had my brows waxed or threaded before Farideh.  Less than a week before my wedding, I kept going back and forth on what to do with them.  I was extremely nervous and could not shake the thought of something going wrong with my face so close to the big day.  After reading numerous reviews on both waxing and threading salons I found Farideh.  She had such great reviews, her location was convenient, and the price could not be beat!  Everything happened so quickly, which I love!  I walked in, sat in the chair, and she started threading away.  I was pretty much in awe of her skill.  My brows were perfect.  I don't think I can every go back to plucking.  I will be paying her another visit ASAP.",1
"We recently had breakfast at Black Bear.  After a prompt seating, Darian showed up with hot coffee and a beautiful smile.  He knew the menu well and we quickly placed our order (only thing missing on the menu is grits!).  Our food came quickly, huge portions, and tasted delicious.  I was not fond of the biscuit  - too large and too bland - next time I'll order toast.  The chicken apple sausage was excellent.  Darian checked on our table several times during the meal, presented our check promptly and got us on our way.  A delightful dining experience.  (And the bathroom was immaculate.)  Definitely recommend this diner for breakfast!",1
"I just ate the most amazing, best-tasting biscuits & gravy in my life!",1
"This place is amazing!! We came here for a quick bite and the food was so delicious! We ordered some street tacos that were on special and the macho nachos with carne asada. The tacos were really good, and the nachos were probably the best I've ever had. I would definitely recommend this place. We stopped here before a concert, and we were blown away by how good this place was! I would give more stars if I could!",1
"Veronica Peraza is the most talented stylist in the valley! You will not be disappointed.  If you choose to simply walk into this Penney's, you are doing yourself a disservice.  Call in advance for time with Veronica and you will be happy that you did!!!",1
"Um hello?  Why did I just barely find out about this place? I should have came here a long time ago because dude, what a deal!  This place looks like a fast eat restaurant but serves sit down quality food.  Yum!1 star = for the quick service.   All of the plates came less than 10 minutes after ordering.2 stars = for the cleanliness of the place.  I wasn't afraid to eat off their plates, and in their clean environment.  People don't normally Yelp about this, but this place was clean man!3 stars = for the Pad See Ew, best I have ever tasted; they are not shady with the Chinese broccoli so it made it all the better!  and the amount of egg, generous!4 stars = Catfish delight.   Catfish isn't for the luxurious type, but i love fish and all kinds, and it's the best I've ever tasted at any Thai restaurant in Vegas5 stars = for the combination seafood green curry.  Like, what other Thai restaurant has this option? No where else!This place is awesome and is the cheapest Thai restaurant I have found in Vegas.  Lucky am I that I Yelped this place.  Thank you Yelp!",1
"Everyone in the store is so helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable.  They have great tips about nutrition for pets and just about anything relating to dogs!  They also have great customer service and are always happy and friendly!  When I have a question related to my dog, I find myself wanting to ask the folks at Healthy Tails more than anyone else!  Highly recommend!",1
"After countless experiences being treated lesser-than by elitists at other stores around town, I moved to the East Valley and found Ash Ave. Finally, there was a shop that treated me as though I had equal capacity to consume, enjoy, and discuss comics. Plus, Drew truly knows his stuff. I've been a loyal customer ever since. Whether you're a long-time reader or you've just been wanting to get into the world of comics, don't give your money to soulless internet retailers, come here instead. In the age of dying comic stores, this one is worth any drive.",1
We had come in from Los Angeles and we were so happy to find such an authentic Indian restaurant with food that excites your taste buds. Thank you for the wonderful sweets! :),1

"My experience here was great! Was on vacation and just decided to get a last minute tattoo before leaving. It was incredibly simple to search for the design I wanted, printed to size, and start tattooing. The tattoo artist was great, took his time and the overall price was not bad either! I'm 100% satisfied with the turnout!",1
"I was shocked to see such a low rating for the Green Valley location of Pulmonary Associates. I have been a patient for over 6 years and truly believe Dr. Christensen is one of the best doctors I've ever had (and I've been to far too many to count). Dr. C is incredibly knowledgeable and charismatic. He will treat you as an individual and not a diagnosis, and he will go to great lengths to help patients with rare diseases (look up his peer-reviewed papers on PubMed if you need validation).As for the negative reviews of Patty and others, I seriously doubt the credibility of the sources. I received allergy shots 3x a week for too long to remember and I never had a bad experience (and I'm a pain in the ass with high expectations). Patty always asked about my pups, my job, how my life was going, etc., and took a genuine interest in getting to know me.I would also like to commend Brenda for her persistence with getting approval of medications with my sometimes difficult insurance, and for always following up as promised. She is incredibly kind; she even offered me her jacket last time I was in the office and was cold. That small gesture showed that she truly cares about patients and their overall wellbeing, and does not just view what she does as a job.Overall, I highly recommend Dr. C and his wonderful team at Pulmonary Associates. Thanks for giving me a better quality of life and dealing with my difficult insurance to get all that I need approved!",1
"Exquisite presentation, delicious flavors, and gluten free. I thought gluten fee would be boring, but the caramelized pears, and the shrimp and avocado, and Venezuelan  dishes were amazing. Service was exceptional.",1
Consistent quality with the best bun dishes in area. They have a friendly staff and very large portions.,1
"Today I went to see Dr. Suffoletta for a new patient exam and cleaning. I am very wary when I pick a new dentist because I have had poor experiences in the past with nickel and diming dentists and staff. First, I found this office on Yelp and perused through reviews, the good, the bad, and the ugly. After reading them I decided to pull the trigger and schedule an appointment.I talked to Joanne first. She is so so pleasant and made scheduling an appointment incredibly easy. I was surprised to be able to get in the next week on my day off at 7:45am. (New patient appointments are at 7:45am or 12:45pm and last about 1.5 hours.) She answered any questions I had prior to my appointment and also sent me the paperwork beforehand so I could read through/fill it out on my own time rather than rushing to get through it 15 minutes before my appointment. When I arrived for my appointment, Joanne was at the front. She was super nice and was expecting me to show up. She called me by name, which I appreciated. It makes me feel like they want my business and the actually care for their patients. Once she got done processing my information, she had me sit, offered me water or coffee and let me know they had a morning team meeting they do and that I would be helped after that. I didn't have to wait long before Jackie called me back. Before sitting me down she gave me a tour of the place. The office is very nice and clean, different sections for different types of work. She explained what we would be doing step by step. I really enjoyed being in the know about what would happen next, it helped me gauge how much more time I was going to be there, rather than being left waiting and not knowing as I have been in other offices. Jackie was also really good at having natural conversation and building rapport with me as a customer. Once Jackie was done mapping out my mouth, she brought Karrah in to clean me up. Karrah was awesome and gentle and informative as well. She let me know what she was doing inside my mouth and what the numbers and letters she was calling out meant. I got to see and hear about everyone's dogs and families and hobbies, etc. Next, Dr. Suffoletta came in and I was very impressed with the effort that went into getting to know me and my story. He seemed interested and engaged in conversation, asking for more detail and not repeating any questions the girls asked me before. It was really refreshing. He is also very knowledgeable and not super pushy at all when it came to discussing the ""extras"". I did not feel sold at all. (I have worked in sales before and I HATE feeling sold especially at the dentist.) By the end of my appointment, I had already been scheduled out for my next cleaning with Karrah, I was aware of what needed to be done and what was optional based on what I had expressed bothered me throughout the appointment, and I would have had another appointment scheduled to get some more pressing issues fixed, if I knew what my schedule looked like. All in all, I would absolutely recommend Dr. Suffoletta and his staff. I will be returning and I will probably even be seeing them for the ""extras"" I mentioned before based on how comfortable I felt during my appointment. Thank you guys so much for making my experience such a positive one!",1
"We have been to Amico's Ristorante many times during the past 5 years. We havenever been disappointed on any of our visits both with the past owners and the newowners. The food is simply fantastic, very tasty, large portions. Pizza's here are oneof the best in the City of Toronto. Staff is very knowledgeable and very friendly.The atmosphere is very relaxing and the owner's are always out to please. Drop inand experience great food at a great price. Best pizzeria in Parkdale.Marvin & Lori",1
"Love, love this salon, especially Alex.  He is beyond talented!  So happy to have found this salon and staff.",1
Best place in the world a must see order the dunkel if you like dark bier but there's other ones. I've been to the real one in Munich. Authentic German dinning.,1
Got a great fade and a great story from Bong. He takes every haircut very seriously. Ask him about his first ski trip!,1
"Food was awesome!  Big portions!  The watermelon wedge is huge and the honey lime sauce is amazing!  We also had the Brisket sweet Potato hash, so yummy! Great little place!  Will define toy come back!",1
"Great vegan food that is affordable.  The portions are huge.  The chef even came out to our table and served our food.  We loved the vegan Nachos and the vegan ""chicken"" fajitas.  You will not be disappointed.",1
"Armed with my Groupon in hand, I made an appointment for a massage.   Amy was my massage therapist.   I asked for half ""regular"" massage and half ""deep tissue.""   I loved my massage!  She gave me just what I needed.  I know I tend to have tight muscles around the shoulders and that part of the massage was a tiny bit painful but not like I've had it prior.   I don't like my massages when they're too light.   I mean, what's the point?  I want to feel as though some of the tension has left my body, and that can only happen with a little kneading of the tissue.   The reception area is light and welcoming and clean.  And with chocolate Hershey's candy, yummm!   Had a couple while I waited.   The only thing observation is I don't think the extra money for the aromatherapy was worth it.  I barely smelled it.  I wouldn't mind going again.  Conveniently located next to a grocery store as well as a pet store and various small businesses.",1
"I just had a breakfast sandwich from Karma instead of my usual Starbucks sandwich.  I will be going back.  The price and freshness beat Starbucks hands down.  You can pick which type of bread, cheese, and meats to add to your sandwich and it is fresh and not out of a package!  I love KARMA!",1
Nice ambiance good food its our first time to try this resto and im not dissapointed. Recommended for others to try it,1
I have been coming to raku for almost 10 years and what I Truly love about raku is that EVERY single time I dine here .. It's always consistently delicious! This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in LV or even in the United States. My husband and I both love raku and we both have very different loves.My must orders: pouched egg w uni and salmon roe ; raku or agedashi tofu ; foie gras His must orders : pig ear ; Teba wings ; chicken breast w chicken skin; Ours loves : tendon ; juicy fried chicken ; miso soup ; and fluffy cheesecake ! What can we say : we love raku !!! We loved it so much we had our wedding cake fr them!,1
"I was reading other people's review prior to writing mine, and it seems we have a conflict of opinions. I'm from NY so I've had my fair share of pho experiences - this, was one of the best bowls of pho I've ever had. I don't know what crack is in their soup but it was so flavorful my sister and I drank every last drop of it. (We shared #9 which I believe is the special pho?? and the spring roll with shrimp - pretty avg, but the peanut sauce was subpar...)",1
Fresh homemade soups and you can get a sample its huge homemade potato soup a hit.  Lamb burger was scrumptious,1
I have had my hair with cut or colored here 3 times!  Tannia is so talented with her hair cuts as well as color.  I have tons of hair and she cuts the layers perfectly.  My hair never looks too heavy when she is done with it!  I had a balayage but wanted the blonde closer to the roots but not so much so that I have to go in every month to have it colored. She gave me the perfect cut and color considering I have a newborn and don't want to be at the salon for 3 hours every other month while my baby is so young!  Highly recommend Tannia for her skills as well as how much fun she is to talk to!!!,1
I actually had been intending on going to kings for some wor wonton but they moved so I figured I'd might as well try a shawarma. The staff are friendly the setting is great and the food is fantastic. Whenever I'm in the area I will be definitely stopping in more frequently.,1
"My husband and I have been helped here several times. This is the only auto shop we trust to have our cars serviced. I can't help but acknowledge the staff.  Every encounter we've had, we have been engaged with friendly interactions and conversation. the people here are wonderful and I know they are reliable. The fair pricing is icing on the cake. I don't have to worry about haggling or subconsciously wonder if I'm being ""ripped off"" 100% recommend this place, we will never go anywhere else!!!",1
Best wedding soup and the unique cheese syeak os remarkable; this is a must visit place in the north hills,1
"A really great experience, the movers were very professional and friendly they worked quickly and efficiently. The only thing if you buy the groupon be aware as of July 2019 the groupon is missing the trip fee - the company made me aware of it at the beginning and assured me they're working with groupon to get it fixed, but I didn't know it at the time of the groupon purchase so it was a little bit of a surprise But again, amazing experience and worth every penny",1
"I never thought I would say this, but I actually look forward to going to the dentist because everyone at Pospisil Dentistry is so great.Dr Doug is kind, and gentle, and just an all-around super nice guy. Just one example - During one of my visits, my Ipod battery died. Dr Doug knows that the only thing I really hate about having dental work done is the noise. So, he gave me his phone and set it up with a playlist he knew I would like. How nice is that? They have taken great care of me and my family for years. I don't plan on ever going to a different dentist - this one is the best :)",1
"Amazing food, every time we dine here we leave happy and full. We also choose this location for our private dinner with 20 people they  were so easy to work with and extremely accommodating I would recommend Tavolo for an amazing dinner or an big event. Thank you  for making out dinner amazing everyone loved it",1
"Stopped by again for  another quick, late lunch.Had the spicy squid with some banchan (soy beef, radish kimchi, and seasoned bean sprouts).  Sooooooo good.  Totally hit the spot.  Also, spoons are available in the container on the counter top and the cafe is open from 7:30 am to 5 pm, daily, except on Sundays (closed).  Sometimes they close early if it's slow.  So, best thing to do is either call in advance to see if they are open or just stop in and ask if you are already near by.",1
"Unbelievable experience!!!The bar, the food, and the service are truly magnificent,One of the great restaurants on the strip by far!",1
"STAY AWAY !!!! IT'S ALL MINE LOLOne of the best spots in town, bar none. Delish, authentic, affordable, yadayada just don't tell them how good they are they might get too confident ;-)",1
"Great Service... Great Knowledge... Great Company!!!!!!!!! Alex is hands down the best electrician I know. Plus, I value my life to much to even attempt to do any electrical work myself so I call this guy to take the risk and do the job right the first time. Win-Win in book ;+)Brent Bartz",1
Loved it. Had the Shephards pie and toffee pudding for dessert.  Be sure to save plenty of room for dessert. I swear it was better than sex,1
"I love Kung Fu Tea!! Definitely my favorite boba tea place.. and this one just opened and I live around the corner. Me and my fiancé were so excited when we saw that it would be opening soon. Today I went to get my haircut at Great Clips which is in the same shopping center and saw the sign that said now open. I ran over to get my king Fu tea fix. I always get the very berry green tea it's my favorite, sometimes I'll go for a taro slush but 9 out of 10 times it's the very berry green tea. The owner was there this morning when I went in and told her how I've been waiting for it to open, she offered me a free drink of my choice so she helped me pick and went with a winter melon milk green tea, it was very good so I may have to throw it in to my rotation. Very friendly staff at this location and the drinks were on point. So happy this location is finally open,  I'm sure I will be there quite often.",1
"The drinks and food are all equally delicious. The octopus is amazing and should be ordered at every table. Yes, the meal can kind of break the bank but I kind of see the place as a special occasion place rather than an every day place. The service was great and even though we slipped in between reservations they never rushed us or asked us to leave when our time was up since food service was a bit slow.",1
"What i am about to describe is what makes this place more than just a restaurant, but in the company of good friends. My girlfriend and I came here and we had 7:30 reservations. We got there about 5-10 minutes early, but our table was not ready so we sat at the bar.  We ordered our wine and looked at the menu, deciding what we were going to eat. We had alot of questions and the wait staff was very happy to answer all of them. We were doing well, when i realized we had been sitting at the bar for half an hour with our table still not ready. Because of that they gave us a complimentary order of their fois gras croquettes (amazing one bite little morsel). Finally our table was ready and we sat. We knew what we had wanted so we ordered right away. I wanted the stuffed pig foot, and out waitress told us that it would take 45 minutes to prepare so we should order and appetizer if we were hungry. So we ordered the fois gras poutine. When the poutine arrived my jaw dropped. It was divine. But after we finished the poutine we waited....and waited...and waited for 1.5 hours for our food to arrive.  We were getting a little impatient. But it was worth it. Keep in mind....the pigs foot can feed probably 4 people. It is the single most decadent dinner i have ever had. It is an arms length worth of fried boneless pork leg, on top of a mashed potato mixed with cheese (so stretchy) amd mushroom sauce. And for the cherry intop of it all...100 grams of more fois. I have reached my fois quota for the next 5 years. Of course i didnt finish it...it was massive. It comes in its own 18 inch casserole. That is how its plated! So once we boxed up our food we asked for the check. Our waitress comes back not only with our check, but two glasses and a bottle of calvados. She said that die to our really long wait for our table and oir food not only would be get complimentary calvados, but the poutine would be taken off the bill. They even offered to throw in a dessert (but we were way to full). THIS IS SERVICE!!!! They knew they were running behind, were incredibly apologetic (wait staff, hostess, general manager) and were very accommodating. Thank you so much for taking care of us. Chef Piccard you have a great team here.",1
"Such a great find, the woman running the place is so friendly and helpful. I don't remember how to spell what I got but the owner will explain the entire menu to you if necessary.",1
"We got our seat right away, Brett was our waiter, he was right on us soon after we sat down.  I'm (trying) to make more smarter choices when dining out.  So it took me a bit longer.  So Instead of soda, or a adult beverage, it took me a while to choose water!  And I chose the Sesame  Salad with Salmon, and the onion soup.  Now I could have left out the onion soup, but ohhh well, at least it wasn't the blooming onions......Right?   OMG, everything was so good, I think this is going to be my new go to salad spot.  The manager, came over and checked on us.   I can't remember her name.  But that salad was so big, I couldn't eat it all.  And I think it was only 600 calories for all of that!  So if this is what eating healthy is about!  I'm on board with that.  Overall, a great experience with this location!  I will be back for another salad, even if it's to go.",1
Karla has been an amazing family attorney. Very profession and very efficient. I was very fortunate to find Mrs. Calahan and hire her as my attorney. Always happy with the outcome!!! Thank you so much. Karla took care of my divorce as well as many custody hearings that I will add was not and easy feat. Karla handled everything from the very beginning to the end (over a year long process). You get what you pay for with Karla!!,1
"I was very pleased with the sales service of Ryan and accessory help by Dan . Ryan gave me his cell phone # to keep in touch if I had any questions ? Made the buying process very simple . I purchased a Scout , Dan ordered my custom exhaust from Hacker exhaust around the 5th of July 2016 . Hacker informed Dan that my pipes were on back order for 3 wks , the end of July right ? NOT !!!  . It took 2 months for my pipes to arrive . Dan was so helpful in keeping me updated thru a grueling waiting process by Hacker , NO fault on Indian of Las Vegas . He also helped me with other parts that I ordered for my bike .  Shelby was helpful in explaining the bike details before delivery , Thank you S . I must ad that the entire time that I waited for my pipes to arrive ,  Indian of Las Vegas stored my bike FREE OF CHARGE for 2 months , THEN delivered my bike to my home once it was completed , again for FREE !!  Thats great service . . . For me ? Indian motorcycle of Las Vegas went WAY above and beyond I would buy my next bike from Indian of Las Vegas , I would recommend a friend and my family to do the same .",1
"Thank you Thank you for such an amazing session on Numerology.  Loved the way Meredith led us through everything - complete with singing bowls and great interaction.  Caitlin, the space at the studio was inviting and the perfect intimate setting.  Loved it!",1
"Chris is awesome!!! This was our second time using his services and even though it was New Years week he still pulled through! Extremely prompt responses to any calls or texts and clear emails and texts with directions! Last summer we went to the Palms, Surrender, and LAX through Chris and Monday night we went to Marquee. Line was about 10 minutes and like Chris told us we had free entrance and free drinks! Great experience and would for sure recommend using Chris to complete your Vegas trip! Nothing but good things to say-we tried using a different promoter and that was a disaster! Chris is the only way to go!!!",1
"The absolute best car wash service I have ever had. Had an entire gallon of paint spilled on my car so I went to get it washed. Being new to Charlotte I had no idea where to go, but I live close by and needed to get my car cleaned fast! The two men working spent almost an hour hand washing the car until every paint drop was off. I went through the wash multiple times and they only charged me $5....such a day maker and stress reliever. Great people with good hearts. Will definitely be back again!",1

"Great service. Geoff was extremely knowledgeable about all of the products and made great suggestions. While we are not taking delivery until September, the initial ordering was painless and well done.",1
"Dr. Rishi and associates were some of the most hospitable staff at a clinic we have experienced. We were new patients, but it felt like we had been patients for years.",1
"My wife and I had brunch here and greatly enjoyed it! Make a reservation because it fills up, with lots of folks waiting to get in. Nice location inside the Paris.   Great service and super delicious food.",1
"Awesome atmosphere outdoors!  Two of our party had the baked walleye, and they were most impressed by the taste, texture, and portion size!  The other two shlubs (my son and I) had the fried cod with fries... delicious!   Beer flights were fun, generous, and delicious. We are coming back, and my son wants to move in!",1
"Don't let the fact that it is a part of a 'chain' put you off. They are as close to a neighbor business as it gets. The manager Todd, seemed to know (many by name) more than half the customers that came in while I was waiting, and you could tell they were happy customers, coming back for regular service.I have been here in the past for an alignment and was pleased and went back for a few  30,000 mile service items that I do not do myself (I am old school and still do my own oil/rotate tires/wipers, etc). They were among the cheapest of the non dealers I called after you check for coupons on the web. AND, they ended up being slightly less than they quoted me on the phone as the Trans flush required slightly less fluid than standard. Service was even done slightly ahead of schedule! (PS - Several eating establishments in the same parking lot if you decide to wait)",1
"I recently went to Daniel for a personal consult for criminal speeding. He was very thorough and did not charge me anything for the consult. I was very pleased because he told me that based on the speed I was driving that defensive driving was a very likely result and that I could handle the case on my own. I have sent one person to Daniel before and he did a great job, but now that he told me what to do on my own to save me money I am even more impressed. I would recommend him to anyone.",1
"They are quick, professional and take extra time to make sure everything is right. They've provided additional repair going the ""extra mile"".",1
"I absolutely love this place , they have just about everything! The customer service is fantastic, their products are great and if by chance you have any type of problem they are quick to exchange or return it so you are a completely satisfied",1
"Absolutely awesome. Extremely professional work, fast turnaround times, and very reasonable prices. Can't recommend enough.Brought in a North Face parka to have the velcro cuffs replaced, and got it back within the week.",1
We just had a wonderful lunch at the Islands! We started out with hot chips and fresh salsa. I had the Hawaiian burger and my husband had the Bleunami burger . They were cooked perfectly and on a fresh bun. The  fries were hot and tasty. The service was excellent as the fresh chips kept coming and the passion tea was refilled. Our server was also the bartender and she was excellent in every aspect of serving a customer. What a nice way to relax: great food and great service! I am so impressed!!! I wish the Islands would open a southeast East Valley location.,1
Most extraordinary doctor ever! Amazing staff! Injuries can be so devastating but Dr Dettling and his incredible staff have helped so much! Highly recommend!,1
"Overall a great dining experience.Multi-course tasting menu with vegetarian option.  Vary accommodating to dietary restrictions.  Wine pairing available.Ambiance:  Jazz music, red/black interior, comfortable seating, quiet noise level.  It's just off the gaming floor - so not really a white linen experience - more modern with a large dining bar that overlooks the open kitchen.  Tables to the side.Service:  Attentive.  There are many options - tasting or ala carte.  Expensive food and wine alternatives.  I will say the waiter was very hard to understand, however, the service was good.Wine:  Great wine selection at fairly high prices - as expected.  Solid recommendations.Food:  This is what it's all about - excellent food and very accommodating to altering the tasting menu for like/dislikes.  We left full, but not stuffed.Parking:  In the MGM lot for $10.  After dining and paying a small fortune they should validate.  Prices:  Eke - expect to spend and arm and a leg - but maybe once a year or once in a lifetime.",1
Perfect experience both from and to the airport. The drivers were on time and professional. Would definitely use them again and refer a friend.  Shout out to Diego and Kali our drivers. They were both great.,1
"Great Burger KitchenI must preface this by saying that I have never treated this place more than a take-out restaurant. Although She and I dined in once, the space only offers stools and a counter top. With that being said, this place is a PERFECT take-out burger joint to have in your area. Ever since I was young I have set myself on a mission to try as many different burger places in Toronto and GBK can dance with the best of them. They offer two different types of meat for their burgers. Both options are fantastic but for a few extra bucks you can treat yourself to their ""premium beef"" option. There are a few specialty burgers such as Greek burger (tomatoes, feta cheese, and psuedo-authentic taziki sauce). My personal favourite is the Tasty burger which is a cheeseburger topped off with pulled pork. If you're a control freak, you also have the option to create your own burger. The second phase of your meal is one of their delightful poutines. They have daily specials and plenty of specialty poutines that can meet anyone's standards. And last but not least, you MUST treat yourself to a cone or a shake at GBK. They are one of few places in the East end that serves Kwartha ice-cream. It is some of the best made ice-cream in all of Canada. Overall, GBK is a great experience. The food and the staff are all on point.",1
It definitely felt comfortable and welcoming at Christmas time. The misses was thoughtful enough to plan a trip this time of year which is quite tough. We were both welcome even though we were not parishioners. The interior is beautiful and the icons are exquisite,1
"We have had a PO Box since this location has been open. We actually look forward to picking up our mail because we are greeted so warmly every time we walk through the door. They remember us by name and excel at customer service, calling us personally whenever we have a package to pick-up. I know it sounds corny to actually like where you pick up your mail, but they do care about their customers and do take care of us.",1
Love this place! Go here...eat authentic Italian...These folks always give amazing service and food eats...we will be back!,1
Great beer! Amazing selection of their own beer! The Irish red and the Cuppa Jose was amazing! The Cuppa Jose was amazing!!! Like one of the best I have had! I ordered fries for a light snack and they brought it out in literally a minute and they were perfect!  definitely will be back to try the pizza and burgers! They sound and look amazing!!,1
"If you're in Las Vegas and happen to have about $200 to spend on dinner then you MUST eat at Sensi! This place is like having four restaurants in one (Italian, Asian, Indian, Seafood). Two words...mouth orgasm!!",1
"This sushi place is absolutely amazing. When you enter it, you're welcomed by everyone and it's just a nice experience. The inside is designed very tastefully. I absolutely love the interior design. Food is the best part, it better be. Haha, I used to go to sushimon right down the street but sea salt definitely took the #1 spot for me. Whenever I want sushi, this will now be my go to.",1
"Amazing customer service! Hands down easiest transaction and deal I've ever done!The associates here are friendly and well trained regarding the features of the cars. Surprisingly at other dealerships I've been to in the past,  their car sales associates are sometimes not very familiar with essential technical background. Not here though! Overall this was a pleasant experience from all aspects of the purchase!Thanks United Nissan",1
"Flock & Fowl. Owned by the same owners as Fat Choy inside the Eureka Casino.First off, I'm not too fond of the location of this place. I went during lunch, so it wasn't too bad. However, I don't think I'd visit at night (Maybe that's why they close at 3:30pm?) Lol.Jenny was the only one working the front, so the service was a bit slow. It was expected, since we kinda went during the lunch rush. But she did make sure we were well taken care of.I ordered the #1 Hainan Chicken Rice. All I can say is: It was DELISH! It comes with 3 sauces (ginger scallion, housemade soy, and chili sauce), rice, broth, a few slices of cucumbers, and some preserved mustard greens. The chicken looked a little dry, but when bitten into, was nice, tender, and juicy. I guess it was borderline of being a bit overcooked? I guess looks can be deceiving. =P I got mine with a sunnyside up egg. Mix in the egg yolk and some ginger scallion sauce into the rice and that in itself could've been a meal!I also had an order of the fried chicken bao. Imo, it was pretty much a chicken finger bao. Nothing too special. The chicken was a bit dry though. I'll stick to ordering bao from Fat Choy instead. Lol.Overall, I would give this place 4.5 stars. I'll definitely be dropping by again if I'm in the area. :)",1
I did come back to best friends during restaurant week and was very happy with the food this time. I did get the garlic chicken and it was cooked to perfection. I really wanted to love this place and now with the kitchen having consistent cooking I am happy to go back.,1
I contacted my home warranty to fix an electrical issue and they contacted me soon after. They scheduled me for the next day. They were prompt and efficient in providing service. I was surprised that it was all covered. Thanks again.,1
"Fantastisk bøf. Opmærksom og venlig betjening. Fik deres New York Strip stegt perfekt med helstegte champignoner og loaded mash. Kan også varmt anbefale deres rosenkål sidedish, sprød og med en krydret sød dressing. Bloomin onion er også en sjov oplevelse hvis man er til dybstegte løgringe.",1
Pretty nice little place. The restaurant is clean and the staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the chicken Pho and it was really good. It's nice to have a pho place down the street from my house and it's decently priced!,1
This is one of my favorite mariscos in Phoenix. The shrimp culichi is amazing. Service is usually good. They are usually very busy and waitresses are friendly.,1
"I have been in the hospital here for 4 days now and during this entire time, not some,  BUT ALL of the staff,  especially the doctors and nurses have been INCREDIBLY kind,  caring,  understanding,  patient,  and they have all had glowing,  positive attitudes. I am very happy that I chose this hospital and would recommend this hospital to anyone.. Especially if you are pregnant.",1
This place was amazing.  A fan of Jose Andres from DC.  This did not disappoint.  Service was beyond.  Ofelia was so attentive and didn't mind us adding more apps and drinks after our order.  Definitely will be stopping by again when in Vegas.,1
"Great wings with tons of sauce options. Wednesday's and Saturday's are 50 cent wing nightsAlso, don't sleep on the fried cheese balls. They are amazing",1
"Amazing service! The bartender knew his stuff about any bourbon, beer,or wine we asked about!!",1
First time here brought my 13 year old son... he ordered the Butter Burger and fries... I stole a few fries from his plate they were soooooooo good... he seemed to really like it and was only able to eat half... I ordered the crab cake dinner full plate and oh my God it was delicious!!!! Waiter was very attentive never wanted for anything... the Moscow mules were served in copper mugs and were mixed perfectly... ambiance is really nice here nothing bad about this place at all,1
These donuts are super yum! Plus they are open 24 hours a day and have a drive thru. They make it super convenient to satisfy your sweet tooth.,1
I'm kind of shocked by all the bad reviews. We had our mix rescue dog analyzed and while not entirely what we expected...it's totally on the money. We always thought our dog Chloe resembled a whippet or greyhound mix. Dna my dog stated she is a level 2 Doberman. We did not send any photos of her to the company.. The first photo I'm going to post in this review is a picture of Chloe. The second I'm going to post is a picture from the internet of an uncropped undocked Doberman. The look and personality is right on. I cannot believe we never saw it before. Very happy to finally know what our beloved girl is.,1
"Very surprised by the Greek Salad with grilled chicken. Good portion and the flavors between the kale, artichokes and capers etc worked very well. The local Kiltlifter is worth trying if you like Scottish style ales. Bartender Shey and manager Danny were attentive and took care of the patrons.",1
Excellent atmosphere and great food. I had the live fit wrap and my wife the salmon tacos. Our waitress Bonita fantastic!,1
Last night was our first time thing China Passion. They have just become our regular. Even better the next day! The food was tasty and hot when it arrived. So many choices can't wait to try something else.,1
"Consistent, quick service. The food and juices are light and refreshing but still filling. The rewards program is also a plus!",1
"Juiciest burgers we've had in some time with plenty of fixings to top it off (turkey and veggie options too). The fries were fresh, crispy, and spicy. Could've had a salad, but burgers are king here! The kids had some thick shakes with their meals and gobbled up every bite. We'll stop again!",1
Best buffet in town. Being born and raised in Hawaii and living in Japan and Korea My expectations where high. They were met I go at least 3xs a week,1
"Stayed here for a few months back in 2004, and it was great. I'm including this in my ""best places to eat"" list because they have a free dinner and wine reception in the lobby every night and breakfast every morning. The food was always good. More than that, though, the desk staff were WONDERFUL. They knew that I and my colleagues were going to be there for a few months and they bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of. They were very friendly and even ran errands for us once or twice! This was a great hotel experience. It's right across the parking lot from a Gordon Biersch, too, so if you need a beer or a cigar, they are very handy.",1
"What more can be said?  I'm at Red Rock Canyon once or twice a week to hike and/or volunteer.  The Canyon is stunning.  It is so wonderful to have such a beautiful place so close to this city.The hiking trails are varied for different abilities.  The views are superb, and it is so peaceful to get out, hike, and enjoy nature.This is a gem of a place!",1
Another east end gem! I took a friend here for a casual birthday brunch and we loved it! Service was friendly and efficient and the food was superb! I never enjoy eggs Benedict but I tasted my friend's order and was jealous that it wasn't my meal! They made it with a beer-based bernaise sauce and I'm still thinking about it days later. I liked the place so much that I booked mother's day brunch for my family this weekend. Can't believe wait!,1
I always get exceptional customer service at Discount Tire. They have earned my loyalty and I will not go anywhere else for tire service.,1
"I stopped by Molly's stand in Mund's Park with my family and I could not have been more impressed with the tamales. The gentleman working that rainy morning was one of the friendliest people I came across in Arizona. While he tamales were being steamed he asked questions about my vacation a seemed genuinely interested. To top it off, the tamales were outstanding.",1
Very impressive pasta dishes and salads.  Pizzas are good but not gr8.  Menu has tasty small plates and sandwiches.   Love the ambiance and service.  Super bar menu and craft cocktails.  Spacious indoor and outdoor seating.  Gluten free available.  The bolonese and pesto pasta dishes are my favorites.,1
"Charisse is hands down the best. She is very friendly, professional, and skilled! I can't imagine myself going anywhere else other than Charisse. I got my lashes done by her for the first time this spring and have been with her ever since. Her work is AMAZING!! I always come out with a full and luscious set of lashes. They ALWAYS get complimented too!! Don't even hesitate and just go. You WILL be satisfied with what you get!!!",1
"Visited The Parlay for Sunday breakfast/brunch. Our food was delicious and fresh and the prices are great compared to other breakfast spots in town. The flavors were incredible and we will definitely be back!  For my Eggs Benedict the Hollandaise was perfect and the Canadian Bacon was nice thick cuts that were deliciously moist. I did ask for more Hollandaise as I am a sauce junky!  The gravy in the biscuits and gravy was to die for...light, not too thick, and full of flavor! My dad had the Chicken Fried Steak and he usually always complains...not this time! He ate the entire plate and said he really liked it!  My daughter had the pancakes, but had to partake in the Biscuits and Gravy too...she couldn't resist either!",1
Amazing they are open till 1AM! They always make a Sista feel at home! Spicy Albacore out of this world!,1
"Several months ago I had a problem with a free-standing ice maker and called Mark. Instead of just coming out, he talked me through cleaning the coils and doing a couple of other small items, at the end of which time the machine was working fine. He talked himself out of a job!  So I will definitely call him if any other appliance needs work.",1
"Pete did a great job refreshing the 15 yo grout in throughout the house. He worked on the master bath, kitchen and laundry room and had the grout sparkling like new. The best thing about this service is that it actually recolors and protects so we don't have to worry about this in the future. Definitely a good investment for our new to us house. He was reasonably priced and professional.",1
"The pulled pork poutine was delicious.  Fries were cooked perfectly; pulled pork was in a tangy sauce with some crispy bits; cheese curds on top; I couldn't tell if there was gravy (they weren't saucy, which was nice) but the tangy BBQ sauce from the pork went great on the fries.",1
You can't never go wrong coming here ...The customer service and dedication they take to make your nails love incredibly amazing... thank you Nancy,1
"I had something small to fix on my Chrysler and took it into the service shop. I didn't purchase the car here but its close to my house so I thought I'd give them a call. Chuck in the service department called me a number of times to keep me updated on the part I needed and was more than helpful! Seriously, Chuck is the best. He really went above and beyond. He even rinsed off my car for me. Inside the dealership everything is clean, there is free coffee and a vending machine in the waiting area along with a small kids play area. Such a great experience, I will definitely be back to the service department and if I ever need to purchase a car, Jim Marsh will be my first stop.",1
"Great, great park. Tons of swings, plenty of apparatuses for kids to play on and the mulch seemed pretty thick. Around the park are multiple baseball fields, football/soccer fields and other sporting events occurring. These events brought a lot of kids to the area to play and that is great considering it is a park. We will be back.",1
Last weekend we met some of our friends that live in Phoenix for dinner.They suggested meeting at either FEZ or  Metropolis.I picked Metropolis just because the location seemed cool and I wanted to check out the Optima complex.The outside seating is pretty cool. Something different to look at!The place was empty when we arrived and it was embarrassing that they actually made reservations since we were the only people there!Our server was Riley and he was a cool dude.... friendly and just good at his job.We traveled for 5 days around AZ and ate out every meal. Riley was the best server we experienced during our trip. And not just because he is hot! He was a good server as well!  =)Happy Hour drinks were $5.00.. bargain. Appetizers were also cheaper and a good bargain!I had the Chicken BLTAC which was large and tasty.The rest of the group also enjoyed their food as well.It was kinda a bummer that the place was so empty! Maybe because the location is somewhat hard to find? Our local friends go to FEZ often and said that location is always busy. Hopefully more people get turned on to Metropolis and give it a shot.I would definitely go back.,1
Phenomenal animal hospital. We were seen immediately and the doctor was very attentive! Recommend to all!,1
"Le bonheur! Nous avions un forfait bain et saveur qui est en fait le circuit cet une assiette dégustation. Je croyais que nous aurions 2-3 bouchées à manger mais non, un vrai repas complet et même accompagné d'un dessert! Délicieux! Le nouveau jardin est vraiment agréable. Seul hic, au moment de quitter, nous ne devions avoir aucun frais car c'était un certificat cadeau mais on nous a chargé le pourboire du serveur. Nous croyions que c'était inclus. La caissière nous a dit que le serveur s'était lui même facturé le service. Je trouve cela un peu cavalier...il aurait pu nous aviser que dans le cadre d'un certificat, le service n'est pas inclus et nous le laisser à notre discrétion",1
This place is so good. Been here for a while now. I love the robust salsa with tomatoes and onions and cilantro. Sooo good. Everyone should try the chicken and cheese quesadilla.,1
"The Wicked Spoon buffet is the best buffet I've ever ate at Las Vegas.Customer service is more than what you could ask for.Ms.Lisa was our server and was outstanding.With many food varieties, it is hard to choose what to eat.They have a little but of everything from Asian cuisine to fresh seafoodThe dessert was heaven in my mouth.Bottom line is the Wicked Spoon buffet is the best Vegas has to offer.",1
"Wow wow the food is so delicious!!I tried the kabob plate , come with rice fries and saladsThe stuff are super friendly and spoiled us.It seems like they truly happy to work there",1
"It was my first time at this location and my visit was based on the Yelp and Google review. Claudio is the owner of this location and I was in and out in less than 7 minutes. He is awesome!! Also, the price that he charge is very affordable.",1
"Family friendly, price is right for good food, and everyone makes you feel welcome!  Ask for Candice - she's the best!!!!",1
"Amazing Salesman and service - Douglas S.We wanted a new bed but had no idea really what we wanted. We have neck issues and needed something GOOD that could support and help us not wake up sore. We ended up with a king size Purple bed. It was so different and comfortable. Doug helped us a great deal in our decision. If you need a new mattress, go see him. Trustworthy, knowledgable, and easy to work with.",1
"Found this place when staying at the embassy suites right across the way. It was so fun we went for the two night we were there. Will is an amazing bartender, who made me almost every drink I ever wanted to try. We had a conversation about what drinks I want and he made a willtai that I still tell my regular bartenders back at home... but it's not the same.. I'd highly recommend this place. It's not just the amazing service it's the environment and atmosphere! Everyone is super friendly and talkative!",1
"Great Customer Service and communication with us was important . Always arrived promptly on time and were professional , clean workers . We would defiantly recommend Servpro of Downtown .",1
"Great, honest local folks who take pride in their work!  As a traveller, I was nervous having some work done on my car, but these folks are professionals who fixed it perfectly and less expensively than it would have been back home.",1
Not very impressive from the outside but don't be fooled walk in and sit down and prepare to be mind blown I had the Korean spicy beef and the milky green tea and I even had a slice of the green tea cake everything was delicious. Even the appetizers were good freshly battered tempura veggies and meats I will be coming back for sure,1
"Honestly, if you haven't brought your BMW or Mini here for repairs or scheduled maintenance, you have missed out on the BEST SERVICE in the valley! Their attention to the customer, that would be me in this case, and their attn to my car was far superior than anywhere else I've had my car serviced. They HAVE the specialized tools and tech diagnostics to quickly assess the issue and get it repaired. They even have their own PARTS dept on-site!!!  Wow!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 5 solid stars!!",1
"When I first moved to the area of Frank Lloyd Wright & Shea Blvd, about a year ago, the first barbershop I found was Gary's! After my first visit I didn't bother looking any farther! Gary is the best! Great haircut, lots of extras, the price is right and no appointment necessary!  You won't believe the superior service you get for a very reasonable price!Best barbershop I've ever been in and trust me, I've been in a lot of barbershops over my seven + decades on the planet!",1
"I love everything about this, a comfy outdoor sports book with great beer & food options. The staff was really sweetly accommodating and found a way to sneak my baseball championships up around the more popular football and in the area outside I really wanted to be in. Huge hat tip to Shane and his team.",1
"Solid Korean BBQ.  Great service, very friendly staff.  Worth the money, it's all you can eat!",1
"The place is clean and has a fresh smell. The staff is friendly and efficient. I ordered their teriyaki chicken special. It has chicken, steamed vegetables, and white rice then garnished with teriyaki sauce. They even have more on the side for you to add to preference. They decor is cute and not overwhelming they understand they offer great food for those health conscience. I'll definitely visit again good price and food.",1
"Best chipotle I've been to. Huge portions, great smiles on employees and great customer service. They came out and asked if our food is tasting ok. A-1 service for chipotle.",1
"If you're looking for someone that you can trust and that isn't looking to rip you off and lie to you go to Al. He's a very honest, knowledgeable man and he truly cared about helping me out.",1
"This is my second time here in 2 days! The food, drinks and service are great as well as the location. Definitely will be back on my next visit to Vegas.",1
"I worked with Lauren and Susan and both were great! I knew nothing about mattresses prior to my mattress shopping experience and feel that by now I could probably be certified as a mattress expert. I went to several places in the Scottsdale area prior to stopping into this place. Their prices were great, accommodated my delivery needs, and overall provided a wealth of information. While other mattress stores were talking trash about their competitors, Lauren and Susan were the real professionals which is why I purchased a mattress from here.",1
"What a true gem!  I am lucky because this store is down the street from my office so I have easy access.  Wendy, the manager, could not have been more helpful.  I love that you can try spices by the ounce so you're not stuck with a large quantity and the variety of options is outstanding with good prices.  I can't wait to try everything!",1
"Enjoyed a nice take out dinner here last night, ordered by phone. Juicy steamed dumplings, spicy fish with tofu, sweet and sour pork, and braised egg plant with garlic sauce. Very tasty, and prompt service. This is one of our go to places for Chinese food.",1
"We recently chose Aquaknox for dinner on the night before our wedding.  The atmosphere, service, wine, and food were impeccable.   The experience was so phenomenal that we cancelled the reservations we had for our wedding dinner with another establishment because we could not imagine a better dining experience.  We came back to Aquaknox the next night after our wedding.  The staff were so great! When they found out it was our wedding celebration, they brought complimentary champagne for a toast.  It was another impeccable meal and the secluded booth was so romantic.  We ordered a cheese plate at the conclusion of our meal.  I was thrilled to see the chefs had written ""Congratulations!"" in chocolate on the rim of the plate.  Such a sweet and thoughtful touch.  We will be back to Aquaknox on our next trip to Vegas!",1
I love this place and come here all the time. Love the concept of a revolving sushi bar plus the prices are pretty cheap for sushi. Service is always fast and it's a clean restaurant! The only downside is that sometimes the sushi sits on the revolving bar for a while and can get a little stale or at least not as fresh as when it was first put on. But that doesn't happen too often. You can also request sushi special made rolls as well and there are dishes besides sushi you can order.,1
"This is my second time coming here and I can't express how amazing the customer service is. Nadav gives great recommendations for food and drinks and the music is lively. All the staff here make your experience fun and you can tell they are always happy. I would also like to add that the food is fresh and tastes like it is home made, which is a huge plus for me. Overall, would highly recommend and will definitely be coming back.",1
"LOVE the juices and desserts. Along with chia puddings, but I'd wish they'd stop using salt in their nut mylks. Amazing place I'd go time again.",1
Very cool show. Flawless choreography especially with the use of the water. Glad we saw in whole in Vegas. It was my favorite show we saw there,1
"Over the summer, there is just a 7pm mass...such as tonight.  Since it is the summer, Fr. Albert is on vacation and local priests are filling in for him.  Since the mass serves the college community, the sermon is usually short and mass is usually done in 1 hour.  Plus, parking is plentiful.  The best kept secret in Vegas!  :)",1
"This restaurant is situated in the heart of Mekong Plaza and is literally right next to the entrance of Mekong Supermarket; hence, I can simultaneously purchase some groceries and order a quick bite to eat. There is a decently sized seating area inside that is simple yet clean, and the staff members have been attentive and courteous. I've ordered to-go and sit-down on various occasions and the service has been extremely quick. The rice plates are definitely not to be missed, and I have tried the chicken and beef rolls so far, along with the fried egg rolls and spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce. The side salad was also very fresh, and the complimentary soup was filled with flavor, albeit a bit saltier than I would have liked. Did I also mention that the serving sizes are huge for the price?! I brought my fiance to eat at this restaurant as well, and she was not disappointed at all with her large rice plate. I for sure will return since I also frequently shop at Mekong!",1
"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and absolutely LOVED it. Everything about it was great. We made a reservation online a few hours ahead and when we arrived to the restaurant we were seated immediately. Promptly after sitting down, we were greeted by the owner who was so welcoming and kind. The service from both the owners and the waiters were top notch. Our waiter was Sal and he was super helpful, especially since we are from out of town. He filled us in on the best places to visit in the area and also gave great suggestions from the menu and wine selection. The food was great- I had the gnocchi with chicken while my boyfriend got the baked ziti with sausage. On top of the great service and great food, the ambiance was awesome with live music and all. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for great Italian food!",1
"I don't know what all of the nonsense is on this page or if they are even legit. However, I do know that I have been coming here for over 10 years and this place is AMAZING. They are always very friendly and accommodating. Walk ins welcome but I suggest making an appointment because these people stay busy!!!! I would suggest LISA she does a phenomenal job and she is such a sweetheart!! She also gives a great massage! They have been in business for a long time and I have not had a bad experience here. This review is long over do, but better late than not at all. LOVE THIS PLACE!! Thank you to everyone who works there what a wonderful family owned business! I support you!!!!!!",1
"Best bourbon grilled chicken I have ever had. Completely delicious. Great service. Best bloody mary drink. Big enough to serve two people and the fixings with the drink consisted of cheese, sausage, pickle, olive and of course nice big piece of celery.",1
"I brought the company Toyota Prius in they do an amazing job, this is without a doubt the best car wash I've ever been to in Arizona or California and the prices are great to wait in air conditioning watch tv while they do an amazing job on your car or truck, I was watching the guys work they take pride in their job and the job they perform on your car!",1
So I was yelping today for new places and realized I forgot to give these guys  5 stars!!!I took my mom here for a mothers day brunch and was blown away! Perfect atmosphere for the day. I was surprised what a gem it was!  They had pecan crusted bacon.......mmmmmmmmmmm! And they gave my momma a daisy too!,1
"My uncle had frequented Monti's on his trips to Arizona but I had never been. We decided to check it out on November 5th while we were in the area. I looked up Monti's on my phone and the first result was how it was going to be closing for good on November 17th! My uncle was shocked and said it was even more reason to go now.It was around 3:30pm so the place wasn't extremely packed yet with people making their final visits and fortunately the wait was not too long. They did tell us ahead of time that they ran out of their famous bread that everyone likes. My uncle was upset but I'd never had it before so how could I be mad? They then surprised us by bringing out some bread afterall as I guess they got one final shipment that arrived. And it was good. Our waitress was amazing even though she could have been easily stressed with all that was going on recently - not just running out of food but they've had various news media come by for interviews, etc.  I wish I remembered her name.I ordered the New York Steak and my uncle had the Ribeye. They were great. I had a baked potato and the chipotle mac and cheese on the side. After we left the restaurant, the parking lot was packed. We came at just the right time. I've read about the history with Monti's and it has been around a long time so I can only imagine how sad some Arizona residents are....apparently a whole new development project is in place and my guess is Monti's got an offer they just couldn't refuse as far as selling the space. They are completely booked up now, like people have said in other reviews - but I'm glad i got to experience it at least once.",1
The fish tasted fresh. The White Horse was especially good. I'll go back just for that.,1
"I loved this place. We had a very comfy bed in our suite, with a jacuzzi tub, a decent shower, a kitchenette which even had a dishwasher, remote control window shades, a mid-size fridge, and 3 tvs (one in the bathroom)...The Miracle Mile shops were downstairs, and the Spice Market Buffet was in the casino (GREAT for vegetarians, by the way, with TONS of healthy meat options too).",1
Brought a friend here when she was visiting from the East Coast--seemed appropriate. ;) Food was great and the service was even better. The french fries are oh so good.,1
This is that dessert you'd drive 45 minutes for... we got the black tortoise and the purple crow... PC reminiscent of halo halo... worth every penny!,1
"My husband and I treated ourselves with a facial at Linda's clinic. We are glad we did, because we had such a lovely experience; the products are organic and made by Linda herself, and Linda is the sweetest person who genuinely cares about your experience. Worth every penny!",1
"Won't ever go to another mechanic in Pittsburgh. I called them 11:30 Saturday regarding my car needing to be towed to a shop. They closed at noon but said they would look at it Monday for me since they would be closed the rest of the weekend. They called me by 8:30 Monday morning with a diagnosis (bad alternator) and a quote. I said go for it and since my inspection expired in a couple weeks to add that too. They called me within an hour to let me know the results of my inspection (and another quote as a result). Again, told them to go on and they called me by 12:30. So from dropping it off during closing hours to them opening Monday it literally took them only 4 hours to take a look at my car, inspect/emissions, replace the alternator and battery, and do front brakes and rotors. While I would not have liked to spend the money, the prices were reasonable and the service was absolutely excellent. They even showed me the old rotors and offered to let me come see how bad they were before pulling them off the car to prove it. All around a good place.",1
"***Just a heads up, there has been an overall price increase this year. Dumplings are now 7.99, only a few soups are 9.99, and everything else starts at 10.49+ Still my favourite place to come for the side dishes. Main dishes are always delicious.",1
"I've seen this place a million times and I finally got to check it out. Very good first impression! Fresh, delicious and very friendly staff! Definitely coming back here for more !",1
Tonight was our first experience dining at the chop house. Everything we read about this place was true. Let me start by saying you have to try the Moscow mule. Then we ordered  steaks that were perfectly cook and so tender. Plus the cornbread is the best! Service was excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant.,1
"This place is great! They gave us an amazing deal for the car we bought from them. I'm very happy with the car, and the price we got it at. The staff was super nice and very helpful. I'd recommend Ez auto to anyone, this place is great!",1
"I recently was certified through Scubafy and it was a great experience.  For anyone looking for a very thorough, hand's on certification course then this is the one.  The classroom instruction was very nice considering the online world that we live in.  I especially appreciated being able to take extra time to remediate and practice pool skills without an extra charge.  Charlie and Nick are great.  I can't say enough about Nick, who ""talked"" me through a panic when I inhaled some water during my first lake dives.  I thought for sure that I was going to bolt but he got me through it safe and sound.  I would recommend this course to anyone!",1
"Always great service, food and drinks! Monday nights are our favorite for wings and shrimp! Great neighborhood establishment! Fried pickles are excellent as well!",1
"I love this place. Food is good, service is attentive and friendly. Around 6pm though gets busy and you'll probably have to wait for a table 10-30 minuets. Specially on Fridays.",1
"We love this restaurant! We come for the breakfast burritos at least once a week, sometimes more. Their taco meals are also pretty great, and they're very generous with their chips. Great customer service and food, we're here all the time.",1
"Highly recommend!!! This is the most breathtaking café I've ever been to - it's like you enter a different world. It's absolutely beautiful in here. The design and decoration of this place is outstanding; it makes you feel like you're outside but you're actually inside.The café and their bathrooms are pretty clean and spacious. Their customer service is also good; so far the employees I've encountered are nice people. They also have free Wi-Fi for people who need to work.I tried a slice of the rose petal cake and the orange cake (forgot their menu names) and it's one of the best cakes I've ever had. They aren't too sweet and the texture is consistent throughout, while the unique flavor and aroma of each cake was beautifully brought out and was not overwhelming.I also tried the hot café mocha with almond milk and it was a good blend of their choice of coffee beans and the brand of almond milk. The caramella was also quite unique and had a nice strong flavor of sweetness and espresso.Bottom line, great place to chat and have some great cake and coffee!",1
"It is very hard for me ever to give a 5 star rating. But in this case, Jeremy and his team deserve it.  we have purchased 5 houses in the last 20 years, had 5 different mortgage lenders, and Jeremy exceeded our expectaitions.  As everyone knows, the changes over the past few years with loans has been dramatic.  Jeremy keeps up on all the latest information and makes sure if it relates to your loan, he lets you know if you can save money, or if you need more documentation.  Our loan was not an easy one, we were relocating from accross the country and wanted a pre approval, Within 24 hours, Jeremy and his team emailed us a letter which increased our chance to get the house we wanted.  Including that in our offer was the key to getting the house.  Complications arose with our final underwriting that delayed our initial closing, but Jeremy took it in stride and made sure him and his team did everything they could do get the last needed documents.  I recommend if your needing a Mortgage in the Phoenix area, get a hold of Jeremy.  You will not be dissapointed.",1
Best tacos I've ever had in my life. The tortillas are so soft and the meat is super tender. I had the Lengua and Carne Asada tacos which were superioir. They are affordable and they have an awesome specials. Will definitely be hanging out here more.,1
This place was awesome! The atmosphere is great and they are busy so make reservations in advance! Our waiter was very nice and the other staff was great too. The music they play is a mix of old school and new pop remixed together and I loved it!! They have outdoor seating with individual fire pits that looked gorgeous but since it was New Years and I didn't want to ruin my hair we sat indoors. I had the bruschetta but since I'm vegetarian we got 3 of the same mozzarella ones and it was so good! The sauce is a little on the sweet side but goes well with the mozzarella and basil on top. So good! My boyfriend had the lobster risotto and he said it was absolutely amazing. The serving was smaller than he expected and despite not being very hungry... he finished it ALL. The vegetarian options are limited so I had the margarita pizza from the appetizer section and it was okay. Nothing too special.. I probably should've tried the sweet potato dish because I'm sure it would've been amazing!,1
"A friend suggested this place and i knew it was going to be good by the out the corner. The beef was amazing and the hot sauce gave it an incredible spicy taste. It is a nice experience to have in Vegas once you get bored of the buffet's, try it out and get back to those slots;)",1
"Very good food and very nice staff, the owner was there and was very nice, I suggest that you get the mix fires which is sweet potatoes and regular fires",1
"Visited Las Vegas this past weekend for a quick get away to relax. We visited the Sahra Spa & Hammam at the Cosmopolitan. We booked the Sahra Spa Penthouse and couldn't have been more impressed and glad we did. The space was truly amazing. Private steam room, dual copper soaking tubs with jets, complimentary champagne and generous fruit plate the amenities could go on for ever. All services being performed in the room making it a truly relaxing experience. If your wanting to do something with your significant other that's truly relaxing and romantic, this is it. I have visited a lot of day spas in my time and this experience hands down was the best. Not to mention booking was easy and the management team was fast, responsive. The service when we arrived was top notch. I feel the over all value of this day spa far exceeds other day spas. I can't wait to visit again in the very near future.",1
Totally love this chain. What you see is what you get - super healthy. Very affordable too for all the ingredients you're getting. WiFi available here too,1
"Just my style.  O.H. brings a breath of fresh air to the stale, old school style of Caesar's Palace and the strip.  Hip, swanky, with a definite touch of class, my lady and I were most satisfied for our date night out on the town.Let's start with the drink list.  My girl had a tough time choosing between the many options of Martinis, and settled on something very fruity (surprise surprise) but delicious.  I went with a basic Chard as that is the type of night I was in the mood for.From there we started with the apps.  We decided to go with Shrimp Cocktail and the Kobe Beef Meatball.  The Shrimp Cocktail was resembled NOTHING of the word shrimp.  These things were HUGE and amazingly delicious.  When we laid our eyes on the Kobe Beef Meatball, we soon figured out that it was going to be a night where we were seriously going to eat.  Again, the meatball did not disappoint as the marinara blanketing the pan went perfect with a fork full bite. Already feeling our stomachs starting to stretch, we decided to share the bone in Rib Eye with potato dumplings and tater tots.  All were off of the hook.  The steak, cooked to perfection, medium soft pink and tender as hell.  The potato dumplings and tater tots (something out of the norm for us) were an added treat to meal.  We caught ourselves gasping for air to fight for room in our tummies while sneaking another bite of a tot.Top button already blown, you know we had to go with desert!  The GF swears that the ice Cream covered cookie was the best ice cream that she has ever had in her life. 100% we would recommend the Old Homestead to anyone that  wants a nice night out on the town.  Pricey?  Indeed, but worth every cent.  I can't wait to get back to try the seafood platter app, and my girl keeps on hinting on when our next ""date night out,"" will be so she can get back to that ice cream.",1
Was due for an oil change and found a Groupon for J&L Auto.  Fastest oil change I've ever had and the guys were super awesome.,1
Had the multigrain sourdough at family 's home this past week and had to buy a loaf to bring home to the Philly area. The cranberry-orange scone was the best scone I ever had.  Can't wait to visit again!,1
"I really enjoyed this show although Dirk performed one of the worst saw the woman in the box tricks in history. Yes there was obviously a fake dead looking hand at the top and a fake foot at the bottom of the box. You could still see the hand in the box when the girl got out and pulled the hand back in. Even my 7 year-old said that is not a real hand. Two other acts performed, a female acrobat swinging on scarves aand a man spinning a metal box- they both were very entertaining and did a great job.But, the random appearance of the tigers throughout the show was the show stopper. I would have given the show 4 stars if it were not for the animals. Otherwise, the tricks were pretty good and Dirk was very entertaing. He seemed to enjoy what he was doing unlike Nathan Burton at his show.All-in-all entertaining. Many of the same tricks that you will see at any Vegas magic show, but this guy delivered minus the saw the woman in the box debacle. They tigers, panther, and snow leopard were amazing.",1
This is the definition of a hidden gem! From customer service to food quality  this place is rockin it. I don't even care for hot dogs that much but I love everything I've tried here this far! So so good!,1
"We've been coming to Booty's a few times a month for several years. LOVE the wings, cold beer, fun atmosphere and friendly staff!",1
Hanging out with my Sister after church on a wonderful Sunday afternoon. I'm having the House Fried Rice and a 6-Pc order of Cream Cheese Jalapeños. My Sister is having the same as I minus the pork and we also have egg rolls. This is my 3rd time here and I do recommend it. It is not a typical Chinese restaurant.,1
"Can't wait to come back! This was a great Yelp search! Savory and Sweet! Delish!! I had The Monkey- Nutella, 'nuff said! My boyfriend had The Sonora- carne asada, guac, salsita! Oh man!",1
"We loved this spot for a ""fancy"" experience without the fancy price! The bread was good and service was fantastic. I ordered the salmon and loved it. My husband ordered the filet and was able to cut it with a butter knife, so tender! We split the chocolate almond cake with caramel gelato (I forget the Italian name for it) and it was delicious. Great quality for the $$",1
"I've been meaning to write a review for the Rivers Club for quite some time. It is a wonderful wedding venue, as my husband and I held our wedding reception here. An important thing to note, you don't need to be a member! The events coordinator is extremely helpful and very friendly, while the venue itself is incredibly accommodating. Our coordinator made the stresses of planning a reception so easy and enjoyable. Typically, food at weddings can be hit or miss since they prepare all the entrees at once. But the food at our reception was absolutely perfect: the filets were all a perfect medium rare! Our guests, to this day, tell us about how delicious the food was. Not only did we have our wedding reception here, we also had the rehearsal dinner at the Rivers Club. They reserved a board room in the back for our large party and it was perfectly intimate. We could socialize amongst ourselves without any distractions from other parties. Again, everyone loved the food! On top of great food, every member of the wait staff is incredibly friendly and patient. Customer service is top-notch here. When our one year anniversary came, we chose to dine here to celebrate. Again, nothing but praises for the chef(s) and wait staff. We reserved a table, thinking we'd just get a spot in the dining room with other club members, but they placed us in a board room with just the two of us; so romantic! On top of that, they took the time to print out ""Happy Anniversary"" cards and decorate the room with candles all throughout. AND! we received a complimentary chocolate cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate icing. All this special treatment and we weren't even members of the Club!I highly recommend anyone getting married to hold their reception here. In addition, the dining room is open to the public. The Rivers Club, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated dining options in Pittsburgh. The Rivers Club really goes above and beyond to make you feel special.",1
I love these guys. They take care of me every time I am in their shop. I will come back for window tinting in the future.,1
I stayed at the ARIA sky suites and it was EXCELLENT! I could not have asked for more. We stayed at the 2bdrm sky suites and it was like a modern apartment. The decor was extremely well done and the service was great!PROS: -spacious-high tech (touch screen control panel by bed)-huge bathrooms (plenty of space to get ready)-staff was very helpful and professional-view was AMAZINGCONS: none,1
"This is a great place, love the aesthetic of everything and seems very authentic. The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. For those who don't like sea food there are many other options that are just as delicious. I can't wait to come back to try the rest of their menu!",1
"We get incredibly fast service every time we go here. Dunno if we are just getting lucky or what. Anyway the sweet potato fries are ridiculously good here with the tango sauce. My girlfriend and I always get the Monte Cristo because it's one of the best sandwiches we have ever had including the offerings of many higher priced establishments. To top things off we really like the ""oldschool"" feel of the diner and the music that they play. After moving up here from Cincinnati we've had a VERY hard time locating a decent restaurant in Cleveland when compared to Jeff Ruby fair and the local establishments I frequented down there. I'm not sure if it's just the economic downturn in Cleveland or what but it's most definately NOT ""rocking"" my taste buds. =) This Yours Truly is a diamond in the rough for us.",1
Love coming here. The quality is always great and my favourites are definitely the baked oyster with cheese and the takoyaki. The service is quick and prompt but the one thing I don't like is how they pack in the tables so much during rush hour so that you're sitting next to strangers. The price is deserving of the quality and they welcome and say good bye to everyone that comes and leaves. It's a very loud place so this isn't a good place for an intimate dinner.,1
"I highly recommend this location specifically. It was my first experience with LensCrafters & I will definitely be back! Everyone was extremely friendly, knowledgeable & made the buying process very simple (specifically when dealing with insurance & helping find me the best deal). Their selection is great & prices are very fair. They had all the same options as my eye doctor but at significant savings! Do yourself a favor & give them a try!",1
Loved the butter cake ice cream and home made hot fudge....fabulous. The butter pecan was lovely. Other flavors were good like berry cheesecake.,1
"Wow the food here is delicious! The brown sugar banana pancake is amaazzinngg! It was love at first bite! Andy Sages Chicken is also incredible it is so hard to pick from all the amazing choices.  The service was nice, but it took forever to be greeted and to get our drinks. This is definitely a must go to breakfast place in las vegas! The portions are huge make sure you come here famished and ready to eat!",1
"Great chopped salad, amazing pizza, wonderful service, and even better desert. Cant wait to go back.",1
"I have been to this place countless times,  and every time has been delightful. Saturday night was no exception. Our server Nick was swamped, but made us feel like we were his only table. The tacos here are insanely good, and the Clooney margarita is a must. We'll definitely be back soon!",1
"Listen to the great reviews about James- it's all true!  Great cut, great service, great price-",1
"This is a great build your own Roti place that was a great find. The honey garlic cauliflower was crunchy with a great flavor and we had a chicken biryani, a saag paneer roti and a butter chicken roti. Portion sizes are large for the price and food quality was great. Service was quick and courteous and the mango lassi was a nice smooth mango and yogurt blend without being too sweet. Overall a great experience.",1
"My girlfriend and I passed F'Amelia on a walk with our dog in the autumn and were immediately charmed.  We finally had the pleasure of dining there last night. The food was delicious, visually stunning and the flavours were surprisingly complex.  I don't tend to frequent Italian restaurants, as I often find them to be somewhat predictable in terms of spices & dishes, but F'Amelia's food stood out. My girlfriend had the scallop appetizer, and I had the warm beet & honey mushroom appetizer. Both were phenomenal. The scallop was melt-in-your-mouth good.  Their use of house-pickled ingredients was stellar. For dinner, we got the funghi pizza & the beet and candied walnut risotto. The pizza hit the spot, and the risotto was truly decadent. The waiters were friendly, the place was very clean with a cute decor, high ceilings and a friendly bar staff. We will definitely be going back.",1
"I'd been missing the pies of a kid named Joey who used to sling at the now-closed Sunset Pizzeria on Eastern×Sunset. Spent a couple years trying to find something as good as what he made.... And finally did, here at Mama DePalma's. It has become our go-to pizza spot. For us, this is as good as it gets.One ding I can think of, though: they've been really lazy about ordering refills for their Coke Freestyle machine. I'd like it if they worked that out, ya know?",1
The chicken teriyaki was well cooked and marinated. It came on a sizzling platter and the portions were good. The staff was very friendly as well!,1
Troon North is an ideal golf and instruction facility. I have been working with Doug Hammer (Director of Instruction) and he has dramatically improved my swing and overall game play. The two courses (Pinnacle & Monument) will challenge even the most seasoned professionals and give amateurs a challenging yet fun day of golf.,1
"This is a classic old-school Italian barber shop.  It even has the characteristic lemon tree in the back.  It is a walk-in place, and even when it's busy you usually won't have to wait terribly long.  It's small but has a pleasant atmosphere and a convenient location, a short walk from the blue-line rapid station, and with a small parking lot in back.I got my hair cut here while I lived on the east side of Cleveland, and I was always happy with my haircuts.  Even after I moved to the west side, I would sometimes come back over here if I was in the area.  I've had good experiences with all the people who work here, but Joe in particular is always very nice and fun to talk to.",1
This is probably the BEST restaurant you will find in Vegas for the prices they have. The food is amazing and the service is also GREAT. It's a small family Restaurant but you will leave with a happy belly.,1
"Love this place!! We been coming here few a  couple years now. Had our Company Christmas dinner here last year as well. Just like all our previous visits today was another great one! We had Dr. Bob as our server and he was AMAZING! Great service, we really appreciated the fact that he made sure we got the best of the best. Offering different options from our typical orders which lead us to the Scallops this time around for an appetizer. He put on a good flame show for dessert, we had the Banana Foster. This is one of our favorite local spots and recommend it to all our friends. We have been going here for years and will continue to do so.",1
"Rick was punctual, thorough, and so incredibly patient with our buyer to go through every detail of the inspection.  Awesome company!",1
"A Valley staple! Nice, simple ordering system, relatively quick service, always cheerful employees, and nice n clean. Prices are very good for ""gourmet"" fast food, and its served with a smile. You don't get service like that many places these days, and I appreciate the efforts In N Out makes to do this.",1
"I don't know how long this shop has been around, but I'm kicking myself for not finding it sooner. Loved it. The skinny dip was great, my girl got the pastrami bomb I think it was call and we got the crunchy Mac and cheese. Loved all of it, the fries, sandwiches, even the sodas were great, I sat there and tried everyone they had. All unique. A pineapple cream soda.. never had one but it was good. I'm glad they had refills because we went through the orange and pineapple sodas quick. I loved it and will be back many times again.",1
"Loved the pepperoni rolls - order of 5 - should have ordered 2 orders.  Absolutely fabulous!  Would like to try the feta rolls next time.  Service was good - Ashley was very accommodating!  Onion rings, chips were hot through the entire meal.",1
I took my dad out for lunch and drinks. I have to say it was the best burger i have had in a long time. I just had the classic burger but The meat was perfectly cooked and had a good taste. It came with a house salad which has exellent homemade dressing! My dad had the epic burger which was huge and delicious! I had the beach bum drink which was delicious and my dad has the chambly beer. I recommend for any of you who love burgers and drinks!,1
"Some girlfriends and I were traveling to Phoenix and didn't know the area well.  We came across Twin Peaks (not knowing it was similar to a Hooters feel) and walked in.  We were immediately greeted by the friendly host stand and had a great table on a very busy fight night where it packed.  I was extremely impressed with our server, Alexia, as we were the only table of women in that place which was initially intimidating.  She was friendly, attentive, and very professional.  We would have never have planned to go here, but we are glad we did.  An extremely well managed restaurant.",1
"I love omelettes! This one was huge! It also had fresh spinach in it. I upgraded my home fries with onions and peppers and they were AMAZING!! The coffee was fresh and smooth! I also had the spice muffin, totally worth every calorie! The staff was friendly and helpful!",1
"This is the best Gyro (proper pronunciation is yee-row) in da Burgh. Owner operated - say hi to Brett - always behind the counter. Tell him Steve sent you. If you visit here 2x, he will recall your name!At one point Brett had the opportunity to RE-brand and become part of what became The Simple Greek franchise of The Profit fame but turned it down to continue to do his own thing, thank you very much!Go have a couple of Gyros  and an order of French fries  which is enough to share. Fountain drinks are free refills. Enjoy!",1
"The 5 stars is 100% for their brunch buffet.Picture this... a room full of chafing dishes, a cook making omelets in the back, and Chocolate Shoppe ice cream by the dessert table.They literally have a version of every breakfast food that exists, a nacho bar, giant fillets of smoked salmon, and I have even seen all the fixings for a full on Thanksgiving dinner.I will be very honest, I have ditched church on several occasions so I can be first in line at 10am on Sunday morning. I think God understands and approves.Plan to stay at least 2 hours and wear your classiest stretchy pants (I aspire to believe that these can exist).I've been to all the Great Dane locations in town, this one just happens to be my favorite. Their regular menu has really good items. You really can't go wrong. This place is very Wisconsin so is a great place to take out of town visitors.",1
"I noticed this place only had one review (and one star at that!), so I HAD to write one. I don't know what ""Brian S. from Austin, TX"" is talking about.When I was 2 years old, I moved to Brunswick with my parents. We ordered food from China King often while I was growing up. When I was a little bit older, we moved 25 minutes away and still made the drive about once a month just to get their food. I'm 25 now and I've lived all over the country (including California, Brian, practically the Asian food capital of America). China King is still the standard by which I judge Chinese food and every time I go home for a holiday, et cetera, we always order China King and enjoy it together as a family.So... the food: Oh, so good. They have the best Egg Foo Young I've ever had. I had a shrimp Egg Foo Young once in New Orleans that came close (and I knew the family that owned the restaurant, so I know they were making me their best), but STILL it was not as good as China King's. Their General Tso's chicken is epic awesome. Other Chinese food restaurants tend to use tiny little pieces of chicken all hacked-up and gross looking. China King uses huge pieces of white meat. So much better.Their House Wonton is perfect for a gloomy day. Anyway, yeah. Go to China King. I guarantee it's better than any Chinese in the area. Plus, it's a family business. I've got 25 years of China King experience and I can tell you that I've never had a bad meal there.",1
Third time to this salon and they never disappoint. Long did an amazing job as always. I always leave loving my nails!,1
"My husband and I are regulars. They have a great beer selection, a kickass loyalty program and awesome bartenders.",1
"I've been coming to Yoga One since June 2016. I was a member at their University location before it closed which was sad for me because they were a convenient 7 minute drive from my house. In between that time, I stopped practicing Hot Yoga because this location and the other in Dilworth were inconvenient and my schedule was too slammed. Fast forward to Easter Monday when I recommitted to my Hot Yoga practice now that my schedule is lighter  and I'm so excited to be back. Coming back to Yoga One felt like coming back home. I feel such a sense of belonging and familiarity and slid right back into my practice. Of course, I'm rusty (I still have a mean warrior 1 lol) but everyone has been encouraging and patient, as always. I love that all the locations have showering facilities, lockers and mat storage available for use. You can also rent or buy anything you need for your practice should you forget yours--clothes, mats, drinks, sports bras--you name it. Most of all what I love is the practice. Though it's definitely got its own Americanized nuances the don't dilute the practice. Yoga One is committed to creating positivity, peacefulness and mindfulness through yoga. It is yoga first and the workout is just a byproduct not the focus. It challenges and grows you spiritually, mentally and physically. The rooms are typically a nice 95+ degrees which is perfect for the practice. You get nice and sweaty and then in shavasana you get some fan action and an icy lavender towel. It is the perfect ending to every practice.  My favorite teacher is Kevin Cross (you can read his bio on their website.  He is the kindest, most patient and loving teacher. I was an avid attendee of his classes at the University location and experienced so much growth under his tutelage including my first wheel and bird of paradise. I love the way he connects personally with his students. He knows you by name and/or face and celebrates your victories with you and encourages you to be unashamed to fall out of a pose and be yourself. He's a beautiful soul and a huge reason I joined Yoga One in the beginning and came back this time. He does a wonderful fundamentals course that helps newbies, veterans and everyone in between to understand the poses, how to do them correctly, what muscles are targeted, where your drishti should be and gives them a forum to ask questions while still maintaining a decent pace. He also used to teach a Deep Stretch class that made you feel like a newborn baby afterwards--nimble and new. It was the perfect relaxation after a long day. I love YogaOne and know that I will continue my practice with them as long as I'm here in Charlotte.",1
Charlie did my 3 forward helix piercings on both ears and did an amazing job. Done quickly and hurt minimally . He addressed all my concerns with being in same spot on both sides even bringing out a measuring device and explaining how he knew they were even. He suggested I get only 2 due to the size of my ear but I wanted 3 and he gladly listened. He told me how to take care of the them while healing and helped me to relax since he could tell I was worried even though I have 2 upper ear cartridge and my tragus pierced . Def recommend him to any and everyone. Second day and doing fine he even gave me his number to call with any questions any time. Thanks Charlie you're the best!,1
"I am a small business owner and often need to have keys made, door locks fixed, locks changed etc.   Often, the need arises when you least expect it.  Don has always been able to handle our requests in a timely manner.  He always has a great story to tell also!",1
This place is so cute!!! I got their lightbulb cups and I'll be using it for every boba place I go to. Hehe. I got their wintermelon milk tea with large boba and ugh it's just how I like it. Floral-y and sweet. Not sure when I'll be back because I don't live in the area. But this place is great. They two ladies were very friendly and made my stay comfortable,1
"Incredible food!!!!  Once you walk through the first set of doors you immediately smell fresh bread and cinnamon that you can literally taste.  The soups, sandwiches, pastries, and breakfast are absolutely delicious.  If you haven't been to a Kneaders please stop in.  You will be pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant has a country theme and feel to it that radiates a warm and pleasant atmosphere.  Kneaders has a new customer!!",1
"I really liked the omlet that I had here. I couldn't finish the hash browns, even though they were crisp on the outside and perfectly cooked. The coffee cake is very deceiving, very lite like an angels food cake consistncy but it filled me up quickly. I still can't decide whether I liked the coffee cake or not. It was a little too lite and very crumbly to the point I was wondering if it was undercooked but it had a nice taste although a tad sweet. Service was eggcelent. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely come back.",1
"Ambience 4/5Service 5/5Food 5/5Love this place! This is my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto so far.Service is outstanding and the place is quiet, clean, and cozy. The location is nearby Donlands station. A little out of the way for me from where I live, but if I had a reason to go back again like the Taste of Danforth I would gladly return! Their chairs might need a little updating, but that's nitpicking.Food is authentic since their chef is from Japan and the value is amazing. They don't skimp on portion size at all. I was so stuffed after trying their pork katsu curry and their hamburg steak large size. Regular is plenty size for one person. Their curry is more smooth and doesn't have a lot of veggies like carrots on the plate. It has some kick at the end but easy to eat. It doesn't have that MSG quality that you find at some other places.Overall 5/5. This is a gem of a place. The Danforth area is expensive rent, so I hope they don't have to cut back on their portions to make a profit. I saw a lot of locals buying takeout.",1
"The night before I needed at 5 AM pickup for airport, I reserved online at http://www.acetaxi.com/order-a-cab/.  Driver called while enroute to confirm location.  Driver was early.  Very clean and comfortable van.  Driver was very helpful and friendly.  Perfect service, I will use them again.",1
"I just really want to thank Patrick Boris and his team with Any Time Auto Glass! I have a heating & air conditioning contracting company that works all over Maricopa County for service, repair & installation and when we have a truck down for service, it costs us hundreds of dollars in lost productivity. Any Time Auto Glass always works with our schedule, performing high quality repairs around our team's schedule so North Valley Mechanical can continue to serve its clients! Thank you all so much for keeping our team SAFE, first and foremost, but also giving us peace of mind that when we need your services, we can continue working to keep people cool!",1
Not many reasons to come to North Vegas but 808 Mix Plate makes it worth it. Authentic Polynesian food made by Polynesian people!There's really not a bad choice on the menu and so far everything has tasted delicious. Garlic chicken is my favorite and the macaroni salad is top notch Hawaiian Macaroni style. I always top it off with at least 1 spam musubi too!,1
"My new favorite restaurant in Cleveland by miles and perhaps up there overall.  The food here is all outstanding.  I was there for the first time of Wednesday of this week and enjoyed the sashimi and nigiri combination platter that blew me away.  Every piece of fish was extremely tender and fresh and the eel which I am often not all that fond of was outstanding.  On my second visit I had the Thai seafood stew.  I was a little skeptical considering the focus is more sushi and seafood and wasn't sure how the thai flavors would come out but it was also outstanding.  Great flavor, fresh taste that just makes your taste buds very happy.  I also was able to sample the Blue Cod and the Hangar steak and those too were outstanding.  The only thing that was less than great was the desserts which at that time I was probably way too stuffed to enjoy anything else.  I have yet to have a dish that I was any less than impressed with so if you enjoy seafood and sushi I'd say this is a must stop when in Cleveland.  Way underrated.",1
"Very good food, will definitely be back.  The owner was very pleasant and her food was nice and fresh.  We drove home to eat it (a 15 minute drive) and still very good.",1
You just have to visit this place. An amazing amount of randomness and silly things... From inflatable giant Hello Kitty dolls to hubcaps and awesome bean pastries. A fun 2 hours can be had here.,1
Get what ya pay for ..... you want the best ... this is it ... the best .... taco's bout $5 ish  dollars each .... and these will be the best Tacos ever .... as for the other stuff love the chicken enchiladas.... the chicken is the best ....first time customer .... two thumbs way up ..... chip and salsa are not free .... but the again we are talking the best .....,1
"One of the best AYCE spots in town! They have a great selection of sashimi, including amaebi and uni (sweet shrimp and sea urchin), which are two of my personal favorites!!! Didn't get to try any of the special rolls, but they have a huge selection of them, which I'm sure are all amazing. 5/5 Stars!",1
"Always quick and helpful when I need them to feed my morning meetings. I always call ahead a large order, so that it's ready when I get there. You get 10% off for calling an order in ahead of time! They are busy. Be patient. Be kind. And get on your way. I've never had an issue here, but they will rush you along if you don't know what you're doing!",1
I would highly recommend Jenny to anyone looking to freshen up their look. Jenny was so knowledgeable and informative and made me feel so comfortable from start to finish of my treatment. I went in having one thing in mind and with some time and education that she offered-I went with her professional recommendation and am I ever glad I did! She was on point with it all. She is sweet and takes her time and you can tell she genuinely aims to please. I'm sooo pleased with my results. She went above and beyond during my visit and I can't speak highly enough of her!!! Thanks Jenny,1
"Have a co-worker in from Denver-has read my blog and wanted to take another co-worker and wife to dinner.  I suggested Tommy V's.  We went last night and Chef Doug out did himself again!  Amazing.  We ordered a bottle of Nativa Carmenere Reserva, Curico Valley, Chile **Organic and Crostino Di Prosciutto Toasted bread capped with prosciutto & melted mozzarela sprinkled with fresh sage and Mozzarella Caprese Fresh Mozzarella, Vine-Ripened Tomatoes, Basil, EVOO Drizzle to start.  AMAZING!!!  SO YUMMY!!For dinner 3 of us had the Grilled Shrimp Risotto Corn, Preserved Lemon and Snipped Herbs and 1  had Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio - Tortelli Wild Mushroom, Portobello Mascarpone, Ravioli Spinach Ricotta Truffle and Gnocchi, Brie, Asiago Cheese, Brown Butter Sage Sauce.And for dessert we had the limoncello sorbet and the chocolate tartufo.  Chef Doug - you are truly a rockstar!  Love, love, loved dinner last night!Thank you again for coming out and chatting with us.  You know I just like getting you out of the kitchen ;)Can't wait to go back with the girls and do a girls night out!",1
"BEST MAGIC SHOW IN VEGAS!!! I have seen almost every show in town from my previous job as a concierge on the Strip. The first time I saw Mac King, I pretty much laughed the whole time. I have since seen the show 3 more times and I always leave with my sides hurting from laughing so much. It is just as much fun for kids as it is for adults. It is also a great value. There are always coupons and deals floating around for the show in local magazines and online. If you want to have a great family outing during the day, go see this show!",1
"Great burger served with hot crispy fries. I sat at the counter and was waited on by Thomas.  A++ service.  Incredibly friendly and attentive.  As a restaurant owner, Thomas is the type of employee I strive to find.  Thanks for the great experience!",1
"Sam's Club is the best! I love their pizza with a passion. Some of the best I've had in a long. Not burnt, always cooked right, VERY BIG SLICES, and crust is good",1
Amazing breakfast... ordered the chili verde omelet and waffle breakfast.... soooo good. Love their breakfast. Fast and friendly service. The portion size is huge. Will visit again.,1
I got the yellow fever - vanilla with mango and whipped cream - and it was just completely devastatingly fantastic. One of the best dishes of ice cream I've ever tasted.,1
"One of the few hotels i ever been to that exceeds the pictures from the website. This hotel is more than perfect. If you don't wan't to stay at the noisey casinos this is the place. The location is in the far end of the strip so if you wan't to get to the middle of the action the hotel offers free shuttles to Caesars Palace. Calm, clean, spaceous and with high class service. Highly recommended!",1
"Dr. Jianu is one of the last remaining primary care physicians out there, as more and more are going concierge. I go to the MD once a year, so I'm not trying to pay $7500 to do so. Despite a big patient load, Dr. Jianu spends a good amount of time with each of her patients. She listens. She is compassionate and knows her stuff.  I appreciate that she takes the time to explain an issue and go over the treatment options in a way that makes sense.If you need a pcp to take care of you and want to be treated like an individual, Dr. Jianu is just who you've been looking for.",1
"Farm to table fantastic food, service and company. Support your local farmers.  This place is definitely worth a try.  Get the Walleye and Grits if you're there for brunch.",1
"People have been quick to complain about this place but I'm at a loss as to why. It's brand new so obviously the people working here needed to figure out where things like cotton balls are kept! I almost didn't come here because of that particular review and now I wish I could just delete theirs because it was SO OFF!  Also, please ignore the other review that talks about this being an urgent care. This is NOT an urgent care, it's a hospital-grade Emergency Room and has all the equipment that a regular emergency room would have. I'm sitting at the ER right now with my mother who has been treated with nothing but respect and kindness. She waited maybe ten minutes to get a bed and when she let them know she was a bit chilly, a nurse quickly grabbed her two blankets from their awesome blanket heater. We are sitting in our own private room watching The Fugitive on AMC because each room has a big TV and an easy to use remote (complete with cable). The beds are really cool too... Patients have their own ""bed remotes"" and they are fully electric and motorized. My mom literally looks like she's sitting in a Lazy-Boy recliner. Everything in this place is state of the art. It's like we're at a regular hospital... Only cleaner. They have to run lab tests on my mom (like a CT scan) and all that is done right here. All in all, I don't think I'm ever taking my mom anywhere else. Yes, I'm sure there will be longer wait times as more and more people get to know this place but we've had a great experience. I highly recommend it.",1
"Loved the resort. Good value and the room was very large and quiet. Only thing they should change is get an adult pool, no saving loungers and 18% added to poolside service should be at my discretion.Makes the server earn her tip. I didn't know about the 18% until I tipped an additional 20%!Kids take over the pool. People come down early morning and drop towels on loungers to save a spot for whenever they decide to come back.",1
Came here to celebrate my sister-in-laws birthday and had such a fun time! Raphael (Rafael?) was a great teacher and very patient. Such a fun experience and will definitely come back!,1
"Fire burger was great and really spicy.  Fries are really good.  I took my parents and wife.  They also like what they got.  The beer is really for local beer.  I had the ""show your stripes"" beer.  It was good, I would order it again.  If you are looking for a brewery on the west side of town.  This is the place.",1
I always have a good experience when I'm here the staff is very friendly it's hard to find a good wax center let alone staff. Very fortunate to have sheena & Cindy they are amazing great personality and great customer service. I usually go to the one in Henderson because it's closer but I like this location & staff so I travel a little further,1
"One of the best gyms in the QC! Have been coming here for 5 years and absolutely love it. If you have a stigma against joining a CrossFit gym due to a stereotype, this gym breaks all of that down. Seriously, the people are the nicest and all athletic abilities are welcome! Come out and give it a shot!!!Ask for Ben and he'll set you up with everything you need to know.",1
Ordered delivery and although the wait was slightly longer than I had hoped for... the wait was WORTH IT!! By far the best alfredo sauce I've ever had! The portion sizes were very generous for the price and came with garlic bread and bruschetta... will definitely be ordering again!,1
If you are in Vegas you need to come here for the best Mexican food and the service is excellent prices are very affordable and food delicious,1
"I just had the best experience at this store. The sales associate ( might be the manager) was so knowledgeable about products, this is so helpful. He also let me have samples of products to make sure I would like the flavor. I will be back for sure.",1
"This is probably my favorite fast food chicken restaurant in the valley. Yes, even over Canes. I love that you have so many more menu options other than just chicken tenders. Salads, sandwiches, tenders, nuggets, the list goes on! The chicken has great flavor and is always perfectly crisped! The sauces on the side make it even better. Also, the fact that they serve Cheerwine makes this southern gals heart oh so happy!",1
"Saturday afternoon was the first time I'd been at this place.  I'd been wanting to try it out for years since everyone has always said that food it's great there. My mother in law was in town and she wanted to try something out of the ordinary.  So I remembered this place.  She's a big fan of Mexican food and when she's in town we always eat that.  Well since she was feeling adventurous we decided to go here.  Well let me tell you.  Everyone is right about this place.  Food it's awesome!! We all went with the two piece chicken and one waffle and my daughter got a side of mac and cheese.  We finished every single bite of the chicken, waffles and mac and cheese.   Food was so good we regret not getting the Lolo's plate which comes with three pieces of chicken and two waffles.  Lemonade and blue berry Kool-aid were delicious as well.  Waiting was about 20 minutes to get a table and about 10 minutes for a waiter to noticed we were there and get our drink and food order.  But oh my!! Wait was definitely worth it!!!",1
"I can't say enough good things about ABC Dentistry for Children. I have been taking my son there for the last 3+ years, and we've had nothing but an outstanding experience each time. We've had the opportunity to interact with each doctor there, and all have been exceptionally good with my son, through progressive ages and developmental stages. I like that the treatment area is open and parents are encouraged to stay with their children during their entire time there. The dentist and hygienists have explained exactly what they are doing to both my son in an age-appropriate manner, and myself, as they are doing it. The front desk staff is helpful, efficient and friendly. My son recently injured one of his teeth and a dentist was available to discuss his injury over the weekend and advise if an urgent care visit was necessary. In our case, it was not, but they got us in quickly on Monday to take a closer look and make sure his injury didn't require further intervention. We will be going to ABC until we either move away, or my son has children of his own ;)",1
"I scheduled this moving service exactly one month in advance from the date of our move. At the time when I spoke with Jacob I was told that I was the first appointment made for that day so I had choice of any time slot. I chose the earliest available with arrival between 8 - 9am. Well, 9am the day of the move rolls around and no movers.  I wait till about 9:15 and give them a call. I was told that there were mechanical issues with one of their trucks, and that their two other trucks were already out on service calls...(I thought we were the first appt scheduled for the day, so assumed we should be the first to get a truck if there was limited availability...).  But to make things right they could come between 2-3 pm the same day or reschedule for the following day. Neither of these options were overly convenient for us as we had to reschedule some other professional services that had been scheduled and planned for that same afternoon (luckily those services were very accommodating!), but we chose to have All State come on out later that same day. Jacob also stated that he would provide 3 movers for the price of 2 that we had booked.  Ok, sounds good! Jacob gave a courtesy call when they were about 20-30 minutes out, and also said he was throwing in 4 movers for the price of the original 2 we booked.  Wow, ok, that is great!  Movers showed up, and after a quick assessment got to work immediately under Jacob's direction. Guys were relatively quick and efficient with first securing items, then moving, loading and packing the truck. The same experience with the unloading process at the new location. Very professional; nothing damaged.The whole process was complete in 2 hours with the 4 provided movers. Wonderful since we had a very late start!  We do realize that the move would have taken 1 - 2 hours longer if it had occurred with only the original booking of 2 movers (which was also pointed out to us at the time of payment rendered), so we absolutely appreciate the above and beyond service that was provided due to the scheduling mix up at the start of the day. Thank you very much!  We will recommend All State Moving and Storage.",1
"Best auto shop to do business with, hands down. I've never experienced a negative interaction or had problems with this location. Great customer service and great prices for services provided. I used to take my car to the dealership but I felt like I was getting ripped off and didn't feel confident in knowing what was truly going on with my vehicle. Here they explain things thoroughly and, while I don't know a ton about cars, I feel like they're sincere in how they do business and making sure the customer is taken care of. I even had a nail in my tire today and came by and they were able to immediately fix and patch it for me for free! They've got a customer for life with me and I will always recommend this shop. Thanks guys!",1
"Amazing vegan food!! So far I've loved everything I've eaten here! Nothing is sub-par, you can tell they put a lot of effort and time in everything they make, with fresh ingredients!! I adore the atmosphere as well! They've expanded a lot and now include an area where you can buy produce, grab and go items, and little trinkets. The fried tofu avacado breakfast sandwich is amazing, definitely try it! The staff is also incredibly friendly and knowledgeable! Pricing is also more expensive but you get what you pay for.",1
Great service and very friendly staff. I am amazed how upbeat that staff is after dealing a long day at work. Plus I am very happy with how my dog looks as well.,1
I've been here twice so far and have ordered the classic gyro and the grilled chicken entree.  Best gyro I've had in a long while and the chicken is so tender and juicy.  The fries are incredible. Will definitely come back again!,1
"This is my first time here. I ordered the Veggy Cheeseburger and I really enjoyed it. The meat is plant based and it has that grilled burger taste. If you're a meat eater, you would be able to tell that it's not since the texture is not there. I think it's a great option for those who would like to eat healthier. Not to mention, the ladies here are very helpful!!! I'd definitely recommend this place.",1
"UPDATE 8-30-17Once again, TOTAL SLAY!I live in San Diego now, but the second I knew I'd be back visiting my home state I made an appointment to see Chrissy and her team. First of all, the work they did would have taken a single stylist probably 2-3 appointments, lucky for me though Chrissy always has such talented assistant colorists helping her, at one point I had two other gals working on my hair including Chrissy...what would have taken 6 hours normally took 2 + blow dry and curl. No matter what look I'm going for, they make it happen in one visit. Everyone is just so sweet, & even though the salon is fast paced, I always feel like Chrissy makes time to talk and catch up, which I really appreciate. I do not understand all these negative reviews, I have never left the salon less than thrilled about my new hair and experience! Yes her services are expensive but you SO get what you pay for ladies! I only have to color my hair twice a year because the regrowth is so beautiful and strategically thought out by Chrissy. Ignore these Yelp haters, the proof is in the platinum! February review:Literally can't speak more highly of Chrissy, her salon and staff...today was my very first time in Habit, and I was so impressed with not only the professionalism, but also the kindness I experienced with Chrissy herself and all the other girls I interacted with, despite the many other clients and fast paced nature of the salon I still felt cared about and listened to, and walked out with the most beautiful hair I've ever had! Better than I hoped, so so happy I found this place! I live in SD but I will be flying back to see Chrissy from now on no doubt. Thanks girl!",1
"We got a groupon for scuba lessons. I will tell you that i had the time of my life! The staff/instructors were excellent. We had about an hour of time at the shop, going over information/wavers and a instructional video.Shortly after we were fitted for our gear then we headed over to the Mount Lebanon High School pool for some dive time. Here we went over the instructions given at the shop and put them to use. We had about 2 hours of dive time. The instructors were so helpful and patient with everyone. They have packages were you can become a certified diver and also travel to different locations to meet your dive requirements. All of the equipment was included in the groupon as well as the instructions.",1
"My name is Todd Meyer, and I used Bulwark security for my home. Jeff the owner came out to give me a quote. He was the only company, that was on time. Jeff was extremely professional, and knowledgeable. Also unlike the other companies he gave me a quote the same day. I had Bulwark install an 8 camera outdoor system. Jeff's crew was also polite, fast, and professional. A month or so later one camera had an issue. I called Jeff, and two days later it was replaced.Great company!",1
Got myself a coconut slush with the taro pudding! What a great combo!! Has that milky taste that I like. I got my husband the taro slush with custard pudding. He loved it!! The best part was getting to put a wish up of their wishing board. I am So coming back!!,1
Best place for a salty and sweet breakfast. Top 5 best breakfasts I have ever had. Loved the BC breakfast with the funky monkey with bourbon syrup. My wife even put the syrup in her coffee and it made that taste great as well. Service is also very good here.,1
"This November, one of my skylights started to leak.  I called the VELUX Sales Representative and he highly recommended TDC Roofing.   Elisabeth at TDC was very accommodating and professional.  The TDC Field Technician showed up on-time and had my skylight sealed within an hour.  He then inspected the roof and the other skylights.  As it turns out, the builder neglected to screw down the skylights and fill holes left by the scaffolding. TDC fixed everything - money well spent!I really lucked out with TDC Roofing and I highly recommend their services.   They were professional, honest and fairly priced.",1
Free flowing crowd -- hospitable staff and a Starbucks nearby -- Winning!! I love that there multiple seating areas around for when you get exhausted from walking / flight,1
"I've always had positive experience here.  We order about once a month delivery for wings and it always arrive quickly and the wings are PIPING HOT.  Their wings are so delicious, consistently good each time, excellent flavour with a good kick of spice, meat is tender and juicy.  I also have to commend the drivers for always always always being very quick and hard working on getting my orders to satisfy my cravings.",1
"No electricity or phones and a gentleman is still here clipping hair. Don't mind the wait, we like supporting local biz. My boyfriend always gets his hair cut here.",1
"My sister ordered a burger here that she wasn't too fond of, the waiter, Hugo and the manager Kat were more than accommodating in replacing her food for something else without hesitation! Great service and great food!! I enjoyed every bit of my meal",1
"Very quaint, neighborhood, coffee place. Friendly staff. Vegan and gluten free baked goods. Yum!",1
"Good food, the meat was flavorful and the tacos were delicious! Super friendly staff too!",1
"Marlene is the best. Super professional, on-point, kind, and helpful. She is a great laser lady!!!",1
"There's not much I can say about this place that everybody doesn't already know. Hash House A Go Go is all over the press both on TV and in Print! I'm a chef and my restaurant has been featured on diners drive-ins and dives and this is a go to breakfast place for me. I'm not a meatloaf lever but I love the meatloaf at Hash House it's the only place I get meatloaf. If you don't already know the portions are gigantic but don't share, everybody should get there own plate so everybody can try a little bit of everything. This place has it all and will be a favorite to any foodie",1
"Alright, I don't know what happened...there might be a little Mandela Effect perplexing my brain right now but I could swear this place used to be called BurgR.  No matter.This place is busy most of the time, and with good reason.  If you don't insist upon a table, you can have a seat at the bar and enjoy one of the best burgers in the city.  It's genuinely one of the reasons I enjoy staying at Planet Hollywood more than any other of the Caesars properties.  The dining area is exciting and the service is swift and congenial.I insist that you try the Hell's Kitchen burger for your first experience.  Ingredients are of the highest quality, reflecting Chef Ramsay's demand for it.  10/10",1
"I just had the best sushi of my life! Have the unagi, oh my god, and the spider. So good!Service very friendly and fast. Too fast. I prefer a slower pace and time between dishes. On the pricey side but so worth every penny.",1
I haven't washed my car in MONTHS! Haha. These guys definitely took care of my car. They offer free windshield repair /coating and really go above and beyond compared to other typical car washes! On top of that prices weren't bad at all. They have a large area for waiting and you can see the whole process from inside. Great customer service and overall cleaning service! Will be coming back for sure,1
"Been eating here a lot lately which is always a good sign!  Think slightly gourmet-ified comfort food at very reasonable prices and you'll get the idea.  The menu isn't huge but there's pretty much something for everyone.  I mean, where else could one conceivably order fried cheese curds, duck breast, a bbq pork sandwich, and brussel sprouts?Saturday breakfast is a normal order-from-the-menu affair, but Sunday brunch is where it's at if you want to stuff yourself.   I like to have advance notice that I'm going so I can eat healthy and exercise for a good week leading up to it.  You can usually beat the rush if you're not too hung over to make it there before 10:30. Oh, and they have movies and concerts.",1
"Ok, me and some friends are here last night.  I read the reviews and I thought I was in for so typical over priced bull crap... NAH FAM!  The Greg Norman burger was crazy good! I had the cake milkshake was everything thing I thought it would be.  Customer service was solid so I had no complaints at all man (shoutout to the swole waiter with the glasses, homie was super helpful).  I'm local and I can say it was worth every penny.  I highly recommend it",1
"Way cheaper than any one else when it comes to water heaters. I noticed a slight leak in the hose about 6 months after installation, called in the morning and they replaced the hose by the afternoon. A great company with great employees!",1
"I am new to the area and was quite worried about having to find a new mechanic. After searching around I made an appointment and am very pleased with the service I received. They were very helpful, efficient, friendly and most importantly honest. The service was fast and of great quality. I am so glad I was able to find my new go to auto shop.",1
"I wish I had the opportunity to get in here more often. I'm a bit of a taco addict and can tell you will little doubt that you'll love Me Gusta Tacos. Besides the amazing food, they keep their menu nice, simple and not over crowded with a million items that are essentially the same product, only with one tiny change to build an unnecessarily large selection. Contrary, each item is uniquely designed to its own perfection. I haven't tied the full menu, but I'm on a mission. Finally, the staff. Man, it's great to have a bunch of people that seem to be happy to be at work together. Seriously, 90% seems like they may be an owner the way they interact with the customers and are constantly doing little things to make the Me Gusta Taco experience better.",1
"Aaron and Scottie killed it on the outdoor patio. Everything was awesome, super friendly and the pooches! I'm a regular now!",1
"I never thought it was possible for me to afford a Cadillac. Was I wrong!  I am not usually dressed to impress and when I met Steven Hoffman, that day was no different. Steven did not care nor treat me differently.  He invited me into his house offered me a cold drink and asked me what car I wanted to drive home. I told him I can't afford what I want and I am out killing time.  After talking and laughing for 5 minutes Steven has me driving the car I could afford and driving home that afternoon.  Take my advise.  I don't review often, but Steven Hoffman is the Best. Go see him!!!",1
"Great service and food. I had the lobster ravioli, this is a must try. My husband had the chicken marsala it was good as well. Will definitely be back",1
"It's always great when a hotel is even better than expected. It's the perfect jumping off place for a trip to see Hoover Dam. The hotel is not fancy, and its rates are very reasonable, but it exudes the history of the place. The rooms are clean, if dated, but that's part of the deal. Breakfast is included in the room bill, and lunch is pleasant too, all done with a cheery attitude. Best of all, though, was their attitude when I wanted to cut my visit short. I reserved a suite for two days, but found I wanted to move on after I had seen the dam, etc., and needed to return home after just one day. This is no reflection on the hotel. They had a perfect right to charge me for two days, and I even told them that would be OK, but the receptioness wouldn't hear of it. She only charged me for one day. I felt our stay at the Boulder Dam Hotel truly enhanced the whole dam visit experience.",1
Great spot to go for everything I need. Super clean  new shop with wifi. Danny is always really friendly. Anything I need they always get it in right away. My new go to spot for everything. The mechanic there is great with his knowledge and always fixes my cars right. Way better then the dealer and they guarantee their prices won't be beat!,1
"This unique place is truly amazing, to say the least!  One of a kind, and truly a labor of love, and then some!  Mark Klaus and his wife are magicians.  I can't imagine the time, money, and sweat it took to put this Christmas and holiday mecca together, thus far.  The Hollywood Christmas movie props and costume collection is impressive even now, and of course is constantly growing.  The New York City department store windows display was beautiful, and an art form unto itself.  The vintage toy collection was very cool.  This is really a Christmas museum of Hollywood holiday Americana.  The gift shop is nice as well.  Yes, the $16 dollar per person admission is steep, and the optional photos at the end (going down the 'A Christmas Story' slide and meeting Santa) cost us about $40 bucks, but when you think about it, all this unique stuff cost them a small fortune to amass and  display!  Besides, this is the kind of place you would at least want to visit just once, in order to say you've been there!  Even if you have to shell out the bucks just for one time.  Parking was free at a nearby lot half a block away.  Well worth the visit, followed by a nice, relaxing meal in one of the cafes or restaurants found within walking distance.",1
"Went for Valentine's Day. We had the prosciutto wrapped burrata, gnocchi and filet stuffed ravioli (or tortellini, I can't remember?). Service and food were excellent...only thing I wish they had were side salads. Will be back as often as possible!",1
"Awesome restaurant with vibrant energy great selection of authentic Thai food and friendly staffThe owner Jeff 's spirit shows in taste of food, music and sports!",1
"This is a SOLID happy hour. Go here. This made It into our limited, very picky rotation. Order the wings. DO IT. They are smoked for 4 hours before they are fried and come on a bed of blue cheese sauce. We got the cheese board as well and It was good. Main bartender knows his stuff and is making great drinks. Really good atmosphere. We'll be regulars. This place is great can't believe we waited so long to stop in.",1
"I went walking around Kierland Commons for lunch and stopped by this great spot. It was busy, and seating was very limited indoors (sitting outdoors in Scottsdale this time of year is just not worth it). I went right up to the counter and ordered a BLT, and I enjoyed it with a Pellegrino all for just a hair over $10.00. I sat at the counter, and my sandwich arrived quickly (within less than 5-6 minutes which is great). I have to say this is one of the best BLTs that I've eaten (and no I didn't take it apart). The bacon was delicious, thick cut, and most definitely not microwaved sliver bacon like you're prone to get at other places. The sandwich had a healthy helping of lettuce, tomato, and a tasty mayo and the bread was toasted very nicely. I also like the vibe of the place ... urban chic lunch counter without the pretension? Sounds about right. I definitely have no reservations with rating this place at five stars. Pros:  Quick service, nice ambiance, tasty food.Cons: Gets very busy during lunch time, but service doesn't deteriorate (which I think qualifies as a pro too) Grades:Overall: A  (no demerit taken on the overall grade) Food:    A  (The famous chef Gordon Ramsay said that if you're going                    to make a simple common dish, you have to do it                     extremely well, and I think Chloe's stepped up to the plate                     and earned my ""A"" rating for perfect execution on this                     simple lunch dish). Service:  A  (Excellent, efficient service with personable waitstaff that                     aren't annoying or overbearing.) Drinks:  N/A  (Drinking on duty is somewhat a faux pas at work, so                       no booze was sampled. However, they did have a very                       good list of wines and some nice bottles of beer available                      for those who are seeking stronger libations for lunch)",1
"Post Club, Long Lines but Pizza worth it...Also usually good Convos to Ease drop on and Ppl watch.",1
Tyler was the best!!! Great service and very attentive. Food was delivered quickly and really tasty. Awesome atmosphere and good beer choices!,1
I LOVE the Singapore noodles here...they kick P.F. Changs' ass!  Get them without egg and pork and you will want to gorge yourself on them!  The prices are super reasonable and the staff are very friendly and helpful!  This is quickly becoming a weekend favorite...nay a necessity...for my whole family!  You can't go wrong here...even if you tried!,1
Amazing little Thai restaurant! Everything I've tried here is delicious. It is consistently good and the people that work here are so friendly! I usually order tofu and vegetable pad thai and it is made perfectly with just the right spiciness. I love the food and feel like my business is appreciated. I highly recommend this place!!,1
"My husband and I decided to take our one year old to check out the dave and busters. What you may think would be a disaster with a one year old, turned out to be a great experience due to the employees! Brandon (server) and Anne (bartender) went above their typical job duties to make our family feel comfortable. The service was perfect!",1
Their lasagna is really great and their pizzas are top notch.  Was in on a Friday and they a guy playing guitar and singing which was cool.,1
My favorite Korean restaurant in the valley to eat.Nick does a great job cooking and the food & service is always great.This place is a little hard to find but it is located in the northwest corner next to the dry cleaners.Been going here for years. Bill K.AR4STAR AKA Skinny fish,1
"OMG!!! Amazing! There's  no Mediterranean  or  Greek  that's even close to this Lebanese greatness  everything  made from  scratch, service  was fantastic  after todays  visit  they are  now the goto place.",1
"I love Thai Me Up.  I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered there.  My favorite is the Green Curry with Chicken, but I make sure not to get in a rut and try other things.  Last time was Spicy Basil Noodles.  Wide, thin, tender delicious noodle  in the savory, spicy garlic sauce.  My husband got the Thai Herbal Sausage.  It was very spicy, with a very complex and delicious flavor.   We also almost always get Steamed Dumplings that come with an awesome sauce and Satay Chicken.  I can't say enough good things about it.  YUM!!!",1
"Enterprise always comes through, even if they don't get it right the first time. My rental car gave me some problems, in that the alarm would go off every time I tried unlocking the car (and the electronic entry system didn't work). Not having had a car with an alarm myself, it took a while (and help from bystanders) to figure out how to get into the car and disable the alarm. I called Enterprise road service and was on hold for 15 minutes before I hung up (because I live out of the country, and my Go-Phone has limited minutes). Once I reached a hotel, I called Enterprise several times and always got an answering machine. Needless to say, I was pretty upset not to get an answer in the week I rented the car! When I turned in the car, I complained about it, and the Enterprise person asked what would make it right. When I mentioned a discount, he asked how much I would like. When I mentioned $30, he doubled the discount. He was very apologetic, and was concerned about customer satisfaction. I left as a happy customer ... I've used Enterprise regularly for the past three years, and this is the first time I've had a problem with the car.",1
"This small restaurant is located in the Kierland Commons Shopping District. They create American California style food. The menu is small and simple, but straight to the point -- as well as their drink menu. I ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi and Roasted Sea Bass. The Yellowtail Sashimi was perfect, I don't usually like Yellowtail, but this place made it edible. It sits in a puddle of Yuzu Ponzu sauce and topped with Avocado, Cilantro, and Jalapenos. The jalapenos aren't that spicy, since they get rid of the seeds.The Roasted Sea Bass was perfect. It was still moist, as if it jumped out of the ocean already cooked. It was also complimented with grilled broccoli, spinach, and buttered mashed potatoes. Definitely worth coming here!",1
Overall Green Thumb did a great job cleaning my home.  There were a few minor issues (some things left untouched/not dusted or cleaned) and the correspondence with Linda via phone and email were a bit unprofessional and unorganized.,1
"Providing swift, plucky service on a Saturday night (this reviewer and his companion were seated in what felt like seconds!), tremendous customizable tacos, and a much richer, spicier salsa than the downtown location (beware Gateway Barrio's oddly watery blend), Tremont Barrio is worth a look for both taco dilettantes and connoisseurs alike. Akin to the bulk of Tremont restaurants, this location is very much the sort of spot which feels like dining in someone's turn of the century living room, complete with some sharp angled corners and low ceilings and steps where you wouldn't expect them. There is an ample patio, however, for al fresco munching--complete with a charming fireplace. The patio is prime real estate in the summer, however, so expect a wait if you'd like to be seated there. The drinks are spectacular and reasonably priced--take a look at the slight, but excellent mescal selection for the perfect accompaniment to the never-ending salsa and crispy, (if perhaps overly) salty tortilla chips. The only real beef one might conceivably have with Barrio is that their menu contains none of the 'traditional' Mexican staples like quesadillas, gorditas, et al. A small price to pay, however, for some of the best tacos in the city. Vegetarians would do well to load theirs up with black beans, rice, and the cilantro+onions combo. The rather sweet/spicy tofu, while a tad on the chewy side, is also a favorite of yours truly. Overall, Barrio turns incredible business for a reason. It is Cleveland's flagship taco bar. You won't leave disappointed.",1
"This was the first time I went here and I was very impressed. I got a pedicure and acrylics fill and I had two men (Kent-nails and John-pedi) who did a great job. Kent actually did my hands while I was sitting in the pedicure getting my feet done, so it was pretty cool...I've never had that before! They did a good job with both pedi and nails and definitely took care with them. The inside of the salon is very nice and simple.While I was there it was slow (Monday after noon) but they had a few customers. One woman came in to get something fixed, but she didn't have time to wait for the two of us already getting services, so she left and made an appt for the next day. They called her back a few minutes later and said they were finished and were able to get her in--very personalized help!Another woman was getting July 4th nails with designs and they seemed to be doing a great job with those. Apparently they have 'Happy Hour' pricing, which I wasn't aware of and didn't make an appointment, but it's a cool addition for sure. Will definitely be back!",1
This place is love at first bite!,1
"Get the chicken wings!! They are made dry (not saucy wet).  The cajun is the best.  the rest of the food we hav e tasted is mediocre at best--but the wings blow them all away! Two friendly waitresses.  We have only been there about 5 times since we started going about 10 weeks ago and they know what we drink!  Yes, how they allow smoking and food, I don't know.",1
"Delicious, amazing service and clean! What more could you ask for? It was weird when we walked in because all we could see was a little room with a curtain, but they pulled that back and there was a beautiful and eclectic little restaurant behind it.Our service was excellent, food was fresh and everything was clean (even the bathroom). I absolutely love their menu and their twist on classic Greek entrees. Can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu!!",1
"I never write reviews, but I had was so happy with the service and quality I got from Martiza that I had to shout out this new salon! I usually take a minimalist approach to my hair - I always wait too long in between trims and I almost never use products or style it.  Lately I was feeling dissatisfied with my style but not sure what to do about it. I came in without much vision of my own, but Maritza took the time to give thoughtful recommendations and explained a lot to me about my hair while she was working. She paid such careful attention to detail and I absolutely love how my hair turned out. The Eufora products left my fine hair feeling so bouncy and soft and I feel great about my new haircut. I will definitely be going back sooner rather than later.",1
Amanda did an awesome job with my cut and blowout  the shampooing /massage process was amazing,1
"Freindly people, clean shop and great yogurt. Plenty of frozen yogurt and topping variety to choose from.",1
"I have been partcicipating in Bountiful Baskets for almost a year now. I get the organic basket, which is $25 and a little less produce than the conventional basket. I have taken pictures, but they are trapped on my cell phone.If you think that getting up at 7am on a Saturday morning is a pain, try getting up to be at the site at 5:45am. No really, try it- it's called volunteering and it's what the co-op is all about. The lead volunteer arrives by 5am to meet the truck and gets a free basket as a reward. Andrea is in charge of my site and believe me, it's a lot of work. I show up around 5:45 or 6am to help distribute the goods and organize the co-oppers when they show up. It's really a blast to speak to all of the participants. Although it's early, people are more than happy to share their aunt's apple pie recipe or provide an answer to the often asked, ""what is this???""The breads provided by the co-op are delicious. Although you may be put off by having to buy them in bulk, people are often open to trading. They also freeze well. I have tried the wheat cranberry and the whole grain sandwich bread. Everything has been chewy and tasty. It should be mentioned that the breads are not organic. Also to be mentioned- they are local.Bountiful Baskets has locations all over the valley- and now Utah and some other state as well.You won't be dissapointed.",1
"Always a pleasure being greeted by the staff here, everyone is nice, accommodating, and very knowledgeable about their products. I walk in, tell them what I'm trying to do, and they immediately show me what they recommend, as well as informing me of possible steps to take after. These guys always make sure you don't leave without forgetting something you may need to finish what you're aiming to do.As for Chemical Guys products, I love them. They do what they say, everything is really great quality, and definitely worth every penny. I wouldn't buy every single product, but they for sure have everything you need and more for your projects.",1
"Great carnitas tacos. A lot of food though so next time I'll try the smaller street tacos. Sides were very good too. They were very nice and friendly, the place was nice and clean. We'll go back often.",1
"Omg. Food porn. The bruschettas are freaking amazing! We got: Brie & Apples, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Bacon and Arugula. OMG, it was so good. For the main course, I had the ""select two:"" chicken and mozzarella panini and raspberry chicken salad. Holy salad and sandwiches, they were delicious! The best part, apart from the food, is the ambiance of the place and the people! The servers were very nice, and accommodating. Oh, the bathrooms are unisex! Very cool.",1
"Best breakfast spot that we have found in AZ.  The German Pancakes (first timer) were light and tasty.The best part though was Holly our server.  Attentive and friendly, we really appreciate the great service.The next time we went we had the Cinnabon pancakes, which were incredible.",1
Had a problem with a large order.  The manager took care of it ASAP!  First class customer service and the subsequent order was perfect.,1
Welcome to a location that really takes care of you! The manager here is great and so is the assistant manager!,1
"Came across this upscale sports restaurant from a friend!  It's the perfect place for sports watching, gatherings and amazing food! I have never experienced a menu like this! It's so fresh and creative and mouth watering! Love love the French onion melt and the bacon nation burger is phenomenal! I love the the owner is cooking with the rest of the crew behind the line and the staff looks like they are having a blast! The GM is bopping around keeping people happy and making a impressive presence!! I really enjoyed our encounter with Nicole....she's fun and real and had some great suggestions!! Definitely a must try!!",1
"Have had cleaning, crowns and now braces with Dr S. The best!  Never had good experiences with dentist.  He is painless and fast. The best!",1
"Enjoyed the antipasto salad and crepe lasagna. Three of us split the servings and it was plenty. Service was top-notch. We enjoyed doughnuts gratis for dessert after our server discovered we were celebrating a birthday. As we left, one of our party stated, ""I think we've found our place.""  We'll definitely return.",1
"Hands down the best customer service I have ever received from an optical store. The entire staff was polite, energetic, and super friendly. Sheena was great and helped me work out the best options for frames/lenses and price.I also had an eye exam with Dr. Hughes who was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly as well. Exam was also only $75 which was about the lowest I've found in the city.Without doubt I'll be returning here in the future.",1
"Wow this place is amazing ! And it's buy one beer get one free all day everyday! It's a little hidden treasure around the corner from target (same lot)1 oyster per person which really sucks . My favorite was the playboy roll. If you like hot rolls this ones for you!!! Also another item that got stuck on me is ""the shit"" appetizer :) I didn't care what it had in it by then I had 2 beers but that's the best part just order ""the shit"" and enjoy it . Really tasty. Cool spot",1
I absolutely love the vegan options at Mother Falafel!! The best falafel I have ever had !! Very Nice owners Give them a try!!,1
"Totally heartbroken since I just found out that Bon Chef closed. It was a fantastic gem that we visited at least a couple dozen times including a big party. Wish I'd left a deservedly glowing review before now. So sad to see it go, and wish all the owners the very best.",1
Lizz is absolutely an amazing and talented hair stylist. She always is current on latest trends in the industry. Been going to her for years and wouldn't have it any other way,1
"I have a very strict diet I have to stick with due to a few food allergies and intolerance's.  I also like to use natural and organic bath, body and home products. I like to order most of my stuff from Vitacost but I usually only do that once a month so during anytime I am between order's I come here. Their prices are a good bit cheaper overall then whole foods but the selection is not as big. Everyone who works here is really helpful and nice. Overall this is a really great store and I will continue to come here.",1
Excellent service. Reasonable prices. Partner had the best hair cut and shave of his life. Highly recommend. No weird hair cut place smell either.,1
I have only been here once. Ate out on the patio. Beautiful view wonderful food and great staff. Very nice restaurant. Food was delicious. I will definitely return to try more things on the menu. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Made recommendations on what to try. I would highly recommend this place. A little far out but worth the drive.,1
"I always order take out. Kana always take my orders. Fast, accurate and very professional. Food tastes very good. My go to for sushi.",1
"We had the best dinner!  Early Anniversary, staff was excellent and the raw oysters were to die for.  Finished dinner off with Bana foster which was a huge hit",1
"Here it is. A coworker last week asked if I wanted to go with her to the Australian bakery around the corner. I've never had Australian food before, and wasn't feeling up to trying it.  I had brought my lunch to work but went for the walk anyway.We get to the café and OH MY GAWD. The sights, sounds, and smells.  I was intrigued. I walk up to the case and it was all over.  2 of my favorite food flavor profiles neatly packaged up in a fracking flaky crust!  SIGN ME UP FOR A SPINACH AND FETA ROLL!   One bite and it was over.  I'm a fan!  The crust is flaky and tender, And the filling is savory and creamy.  Flavors are seriously on point. (channeling my inner Guy F.) I may have a GAB problem cause I've been here now 3 times since last week. Dang you co-worker for widening my lunchtime options and slenderizing my pocketbook.  LOL",1
"Go forth, and sing thy ass off.I am a bit of a Karaoke aficionado... or possibly, a Karaoke madman.  Just saying, I sing alot, yo.  So, I've been to alot of Karaoke joints, and the two times I've hit up the Imperial Palace Karaoke Club have been some of the best.Convenient and requiring only the purchase of a single drink, its a good time you can't beat with a stick.  Being Vegas, the crowd is ridiculously diverse and by and large hilarious.  The song list is pretty impressive, and is mercifully lacking the mainstay non-karaoke-friendly material.  You will not have to listen to white suburban versions of 50 cent or watch a white-hat fratboy in khaki pants do a drunken rendition of ""Enter Sandman"".The DJs were excellent at their craft and the sound equipment is very quality. We witnessed some amazing talented singers and some incredible drunken incompetency; culminating in a guy who combined ""Purple Rain"" with an inebriated cell phone attempt to locate his drunken friend.  Also, a woman who rewrote the lyrics to Rod Stewart's ""Maggie"" into a poorly rendered ballad about her 2 dogs.  You just can't make this kind of golden material up...If you're at the palace and need some ridiculous events to attend, witness the Karaoke madness and preferably, sing along.",1
"The boot camp class with Jay was fantastic, I felt all the fat burning off, highly recommended and I will be back for another session",1
"I've been here several times, and the food is always great. The menu gives you authentic options, and more common dishes too. It's a small place, so sometimes it can get a little busy, but it's worth it. There's also a nice little outdoor seating area that's perfect for nice weather. It can be a little bit hard to spot your first time, but it's right off of the main road in Carnegie!",1
"So happy we went with Jeremy and Clayton Family Tile. Jeremy, John and Garron did 1300 sq ft of 6x24"" wood-like porcelain and the results are beautiful. Jeremy was able to start our job a week earlier than expected, to our delight, and worked every day we let him, even through the weekend. The labor cost and draw schedule were simple and fair; anyone with a basic calculator could verify the numbers. You will be hard-pressed to find guys with more knowledge and experience in all manners tile, not to mention the level of professionalism and respect these guys bring to the job site. Clayton Family Tile is an example of when it's better to go with the small family business over the big guys. For as long as these guys are in business, they are our go-to. Back splash is next!...",1
Very courteous and polite staff. Did the muzzle brake and trigger install in a timely and surprisingly economical fashion. Definitely my go to gunsmith from now on.,1
"I called earlier in the day and scheduled our appointment so the wait was minimal. Our stylist was quick, patient, and efficient with our 11 month old. He enjoyed it the whole time between the movie, the exciting seat, and his curiosity of having his first haircut. We will definitely be back",1
I have attended a 20 people birthday party at this location. We have all finished the night beyond satisfied with the service and food quality. Highly recommendable.,1
"I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks. At the ripe old age of 65, I decided to join a gym. My goal was to build up some endurance for a trip to Egypt which I knew would entail a lot of walking. I went 4 to 5 times a week. When you join any gym, of course they are going to try to push training sessions. My complementary workout was with Ashley. She was so kind while assessing my abilities and strength. At the beginning of the session I asked her to show me how to use the equipment properly, to avoid an injury. At the end of the session, I was signing up. At the risk of sounding corny, it has been life changing. In six months of going it has changed me both physically and mentally . Twice a week she puts me through the paces. I've got muscles I didn't know I owned. I see me being able to lift heavier weights, be more flexible and much improved cardio stamina. The days I don't work with her, she and every staff member, including the manager, Rudy, Tim from maintenance...everyone.....greet me & honestly seem happy to see me there and trying. AND best of all, I've gained 11 lbs of lean muscle mass. This particular location is not one of the newer ones with a pool and movie room, however, its like a family. The other members smile and cheer you on (quietly) and then there is my tough but caring trainer Ashley teaching me so much about the rewards of perseverance. It's always clean and the equipment well maintained.",1
My husband bought his first snowboard package at this store for our trip to Tahoe!  Time was spent with him making sure he could discuss his skill and his new ride. We left Vegas in a dust storm and arrived in Tahoe in a snowstorm.  We spent a month and had 4 awesome storms with feet of powder!  He loved everything about his new ride and his trip to your store!  Many riders stopped him to ask about his combo!  Many thanks for helping to make our ski trip absolutely amazing!  Shop here for the best customer service ever!  Thank u and he is thrilled with all of his equipment!,1
Best selection of tequila in the Quarter. We love it!! Food is amazing. Love the outdoor patio.,1
"This place is fabulous! Very friendly staff. Everyone is great although my favorite is Lee. She is super sweet and very good at her job. I never feel rushed even when there's people waiting because they allow walk-ins. The manager; Jenny, is nice and pleasant. I've had mani, pedi, waxing, and facial, and they've all been wonderful. Check this place out, you won't regret it.",1
"Texas Roadhouse provided free lunches on Vererans Day to all Veterans and they did a wonderful job. The restaurant was very crowded, but the staff worked hard and was very friendly. The food arrived hot and was delicious. Texas Roadhouse made a lot of families and Veterans happy.  A special thank you to Katie, who worked at the bar, for delivering exceptional customer service and for taking good care of the Veterans who were dining alone and sat at the bar.  Katie made the Veterans feel appreciated.",1
"We bought a dinner package with our tix for the Wow show so I was not expecting anything special but boy were we surprised by the All-American Bar & Grill. The burgers are incredibly tasty and the fries may be some of the best ever. The fries are coated and are very delicious. The portion is very generous. Our meal came with a drink and a dessert. This place is not inexpensive but the meal is definitely a great value. We also had the fish & chips which was also very good. Again, there was a large portion of fish and fries. Get the malt vinegar for an awesome meal.",1
The food is SO good! Plus you can bring your pups for both indoor and outdoor seating :) an all time fav,1
"A lovely market in the Little Italy neighborhood of Montreal. Grab food for the family towards the back of the market. There is paid parking available as well. Shop here for all of your fruits & vegetables or just to stroll around the market to enjoy local produce. There is a delicious creperie where I enjoy a salmon, goat cheese & spinach crepe big enough for two. Explore the area near the food stations for cheese, meat, gifts, gelato and olives.",1
The service is great and the environment is soothing. I did the 60 mins foot massage and the massage is excellent. I feel relaxed and refreshed afterwards.,1
"This is a definite 'ante up' to every other place in town to bump it up a bit instead of seeing how many airline-style cramped seats they can put into one theater at the casinos. As far as I'm concerned, I only see movies here from now on! See you again tonight Galaxy!",1
"I discovered this gem when a friend invited me there for a wine and paint class, and I had a wonderful experience! The venue itself is a cute and cozy place, while being quite sizable. The bar to your left serves a dual purpose, functioning as a coffee bar earlier in the day and a wine bar for tasting nights. They rotate their wine flavors, and the staff sure do know them! You can try five samples for only $12, with their weekly online newsletter updating you on the latest and greatest.There is plenty of seating to the right and middle of the space, with a fireplace and couches to the back right. The back left area, meanwhile, is reserved for events. They do wine and paint nights, craft nights, yoga classes and more!Little Birdie also has adorable home items for sale, most notably quotation wall art that would make any Joanna Gaines fan drool!But the cherry on top is the staff. I was greeted so warmly when I walked in and asked if I had any questions as a new visitor. During our painting class, the owner came over to check in on us several times to see if we needed anything and offer great wine recommendations. Then as I left, I was thanked and goodbyed like an old friend.I can't wait to come back!",1
"I was very impressed with company! I opened the project on HomeAdvisor to get an idea of companies to call. After 1.5 hours I had both a call/voicemail and email from Climate Control Experts asking how they can help. I also got a call/voicemail from HomeAdvisor an hour after that saying CCE wanted to talk to me. I sent the list of companies to my husband as well as the company we used 3 years ago. He called all of them and CCE is the only one that picked up/called back. He scheduled a tech to come 3-5pm. At 2pm I got a text message saying the tech was on their way and included a picture of the tech. I also had an email with the same information. I also got a call from the tech saying they were on their way. My husband handled the interaction with the tech but said he was very professional, kind and knowledgeable. In order to fix our issue, a part was needed and the tech called my husband when he was back on his way. They were able to fix our A/C and just in time for the warm weather! We were very satisfied with everything this company did.",1
Great service and the food was really good!!! Loved the chicken with mushroom hot dog! It's only $4 during happy hour!!!,1
"We brought our three dogs to Canine Preffered today for the first time.  We had a great experience from start to finish.  We have three dogs, a pug, a Min Pin Chihuahua mix and a Rottweiler.  We don't have problems with our small dogs, but have been given the cold shoulder by a few other groomers in the near by area because of our Rottie.  Big dogs are given a bad name before they are given a chance.  We are happy with our experience with Canine Preferred and look forward to them becoming our ""regular"" grooming spot.",1
I spent all weekend driving all over the city. I hit 9 others from all over town and I have to say all roads always lead me back here.The store is always well organized. They have a good selection of hard to find records. I make a 30 min drive to come here and it's well worth it,1
"I love this place!!!! The best my dog has looked ( and smelt, lol) in a long time!! they really took their time there and made sure i was happy with everything from start to finish. I give it a 10 thumbs up!!!",1
"This is definitely one of the best pizza places you'll find in Scottsdale that's open late. After a long night of partying, Joes is definitely the spot to be to eat after Old Town has done you in.My favorite thing about this place is that if you work in the nightlife industry (lucky for me!) you get a discount and the staff is extremely friendly to all! This is my favorite place to go after work and while on break!",1
Beyond helpful employees here! Called in to order over 20 honey baked hams for our customers for Christmas. Kaylee was happy and knew her stuff. They not only gave us a great price for ordering so many but had them each individually boxed with their own ice packs to keep them cold. When my husband picked them up he said they were ready to go and it was the easiest pick up and all employees were very helpful. High quality hams and high quality service.,1
"Okay so I bitched that I wanted a salon that does both cut and color. I went to Root, ended up with damaged hair..(see separate review) and I went to Main Attraction and ended up with ""Texas Hair"" (see separate review). Well its about that time to go back to short and sassy and well trusting someone to do that is a much bigger trust than trusting someone to trim. So without a second thought I returned to Mark because there is just no one I trust more and no one I have found even close to comparable. I ended up not going as short as I had prepared myself to but nonetheless he turned me from blah to sassy with his magical skills. Mark rocks the scissors like no other. No one can compare, he is a true wizard. Trust me when I say there are a lot of salons out there that are overhyped for mediocre service. This salon is the perfect example of practice what you preach.. ""If you don't look good, we don't look good"".P.S. The girl that colored my hair in my previous review.. is no longer at Vidal..",1
Excellent food and service. Super friendly both the bar manager and bartender. We are staying at Veer Towers and found it while out exploring the area. The meatballs are excellent big serving for a great price!,1
I went with a friend last night and the wine was on sale for $4 glass.  We started with the nachos which had an amazing house guacamole and salsa.  I had Molcaje for the first time and was amazed with the flavour explosion!  I had to take some home.  My friend had the Enchiladas which were delicious and the best refried beans I have ever had.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.,1
"I love this place! The prices are decent, the people are attentive, and my nails always look great!!!  brought my mom here for Mother's Day with my sister, and although they were busy, we were seated almost immediately and I love their massage chairs, lol. I don't have a specific preference for nail tech, I've only got a few times but I've always gotten great results and they're prompt to fix anything I don't like. My family won't go anywhere else",1
"Just had an excellent meal at Fix.  My steak was cooked perfectly.  The chicken wings are the best I've ever had and I loved the spin on the mac & cheese.  If you don't mind spending the $, this is an excellent restaurant.",1
"This place is amazing and sucky all at once. I went once at 9AM and once again 5AM later the next morning. Don't order a chrorizo omlett, because there isn't one on the menu.",1
Love the Mexican food here. I come here once or twice a week and I'm never disappointed by the food or the customer service. Free refills on chips and the hot sauce has excellent flavor. The carney asada is my favorite dish at this restaurant.,1
"I LOVE Green Home Termite and Pest Control & have been utilizing them for five years. The company has exceptional ethics and are an absolute pleasure to deal with- from the owner to the professional technicians. My professional technician,Trevon, rocks. He's a perfectionist with a great attitude. The chemicals Green Home uses are environmentally friendly, are not toxic to animals or people, and do not cause asthma or allergy exacerbations in myself. My 2 dogs are able to be outside with Trevon when he's working his magic in my yard!  I wouldn't utilize any other company for pest or termite control. 5+ stars in all areas.",1
"Phil's is the best! I've been coming here for over 30 years (basically since I was born), and this is the first place I go whenever I come back home to Charlotte. The food is excellent, especially the egg salad, and the service is wonderful. You really feel like family when you're here. My family are huge fans of the rye bread, white fish salad, and brisket. If you're looking for a casual and delicious place for lunch, do yourself a favor and check out Phil's!",1
"Peter Zistas is a great guy to know if you want to look a little better and a little different. He takes time to get to know your personal style. He makes things right no matter what it takes and if something is not the very best fit, he WILL NOT PUT YOU IN IT. Glad to find this custom clotherie in Phoenix. Definitely the best in the business.",1
"Great price, quick service, my clothes look nice and new again!Highly recommend this hidden gem in the strip mall across from the Hard Rock.",1
This place has really good ambiance and really cool staff. I love the menu. Their dishes are beautifully plated. They explained every dish they brought to us basically. The chuka buns are amazing!! And the midori salad oh man,1
"This was our first time at AquaKnox.  It was first class all the way.  Jesse was our waiter; he did a fantastic job, as did the sommelier (a woman whose name escapes me right now).  The entire staff was fantastic.",1
"This is one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. We absolutely enjoyed this restaurant. The service is always  fantastic, as  this is a family owned restaurant. Absolutely fantastic food and great service. We highly recommend it!",1
A huge thank you to Manager Lindsay for quickly resolving our issue tonight. We have been going to this White Chocolate Grill for many years now. We always have a great experience. Tonight was the first night where we had a problem with our food not coming out correctly. Lindsay kindly resolved the issue for us quickly. Both Lindsay and our server Sarah are wonderful assets to this company!  Thank you so much!,1
Very welcoming staff; you will feel at home even if you don't know anything about cigars. And great selection.,1
"This was not my first experience at a molecular gastronomy dinner and it definitely won't be my last but if I were to pick one dish for my death row meal, many of these bites would have sufficed!I landed a reservation for é luckily one month in advance by emailing them and praying...not really but I had a suspicion that since I was a single diner, that they would be able to accommodate me if there were an odd amount of people in other parties totalling the 8 total...I'm the wild card I guess! Lo and behold a few days later I got the confirmation and I was as giddy as ever! Just like when I went to the other gastronomy place by Jose Andres, minibar, in DC, you have to fax some info in to confirm your dining experience where it explains the pricing as well as asks you for any allergies. Few weeks later and I was wondering if my golden ticket would ever come in because I read online that some people got them and some did not. Not to worry guys, it came in the mail just in time and you bet I flaunted that shiny piece of paper around singing ""I've got a golden ticket"" to all my roommates, except this time its not to the chocolate factory, its to somewhere hopefully better.Fast forward to my arrival in Vegas, after all day of walking on the strip I make my way over to Jaleo inside the Cosmo and they sat me at a table with other fellow diners. We all got some cocktails as the waiter/host explained some things to us on the menu and we all got to know each other a little bit. One of the couples I dined with came all the way from Australia, and I thought Virginia was far...! Some of the options offered were alcohol packages  which I believe were around $100 starting which I decided not to opt for since I was going out in town later and wanted to pace myself. Another option was to have shaved truffle on some of the dishes for an mere...$50, yea I'll skip that and save it for gambling. We went on back into a room and my culinary adventure began...The room was tiny, and filled with all sorts of knick knacks and odd items but the most prominent thing that stood out was that the walls were lined with mini old school mail boxes and after the head chef explained that this room was supposed to mimic Jose's mind, things started to make sense. From there on we were introducing our palates to the first of many bites and I'll try to sum up the ones that really stood out to me if I can remember their names. Branch of the dessert: this looked like a table piece but what it really was, was kalamata olives liquified and shaped into branch type fixtures that were crunchy.Iberico chickpeas: This looked like a soup but the white, heavy liquid was melted iberico fat and it was accompanied by chickpeas and other goodies.Beet gazpacho: Think like an ice cream sandwich, but instead of the chocolate buns you have a thicker, almost cardboard consistency outer layer, and inside had a cold paste which felt like and resembled sherbet ice cream BUT everything in here is made entirely of beets and has a beet flavor.Cheese and Nuts: Really do not know how to describe this one, there was a tiny ball of cheese that had a hard outer shell with tangy sharp white cheese inside and a small spoon of soft nuts. We were told to take a bite of the cheese, eat the nuts, and finish off the cheese bite..at this point you start realizing that some dishes have special directions. Cava Sangria: Why order wine when you can have it spherified and placed on a large spoon to have it explode in your mouth? Very soothing and refreshing...drink? Live scallops with black truffle: Fresh scallop made to look like kind of how beef tartare is presented to you or a crab cake and topped with all sorts of truffle goodies. Chuleta: My favorite dish, the wagyu beef cooked to perfection with a small but filling side of mashed potato gnocchi. This was one dish I throroughly savoured bite for bite. My fellow diners next to me even offered to give me some of their shaved truffle to top mine just because they wanted me to try the amazingness of it all....score!Empanada: Think pierogi, except made with cotton candy instead of dough, but the cotton candy has no flavor, and stuffed with a cold, buttery, crunchy, popcorn tasting stuffing. Very interesting. There were many other dishes during my stay but all in all this was a truly remarkable experience for my taste buds and mind. Just to watch the chefs prepare each plate with delicacy, care, and passion was worth the $195 alone. I was even stuffed after the meal, which I can't say for other gastronomy places Ive been to and I was perfectly ok with that. I was guest #12,494 but I hope to have another number in the future because they are always changing the menu up which leaves my mind being a curious cat to what else could they possibly create!",1
Loooove Elevate's White Chocolate Mocha. They roast their own coffee and have life music on weekends. Elevate is also a great place to study.,1
"Are you kidding me with this place?? I ordered 3 rolls and loved them all so much. The Mango Salmon roll is better than Sushi Tower's (still love ST!!). The Grand Canyon roll was to die for! I was not expecting the mushrooms and scallops to completely cover the dinner plate but won't complain; leftovers for me!  I always order a Japanese Lasagna because it just hits the spot with the sweet & savory flavors. The busboy gave me a peeled and sliced orange that was adorably presented. From being greeted by the whole staff & sushi chefs to the overall service, timing of food, presentation, temperature, taste, and even the goodbyes... my heart is warm. Thank you!",1
Nice location nice store slightly busy this afternoon but its was expected staff is very helpful friendly. Staff is still a little overwhelmed with the high demand and large crowd but Im sure that will mellow out soon. Will definitely be going back.,1
"It was our first time at this place and we absolutely loved it! We are definitely coming back, it's perfect to go have breakfast or lunch, the food it's delicious and fresh.",1
"i spent allot of time here because most of the people i was with stayed there. it has a huge lobby where you can buy ticket to most thing in Vegas  the pool it  beautiful, it has a waterfall and a bar right next to it. my good friend got married there it was really nice, it was 7/7/07. there was about 20 of us there, i had a great time there. and oh ya there is a small arcade  there for kids.   i don't know the price because  i did not stay there but its a really cool place",1
"As a member of Canadian Business Chicks, I am in the Petroleum Club monthly for events, since they use this venue for their breakfast meetings.Its hard to believe that there was a time where this warm, inviting space did not welcome women. considering we overrun it now with our monthly meetings.As a regular attendee with my networking group, I have frequented the Petroleum Club as well for one-off events during the work day and evening events as well.Why five stars?* I have had breakfast, meals and appetizers there, and not once have I had a bad experience.  The food and food services have been top notch every time* The bathrooms and common areas are always in a clean and orderly state* Nothing stands out as an issue. I look forward to attending events there, because is is consistently awesome.",1
First time ordering here and will do so again. Pizza delivered between time stated when ordering.. driver was very nice and pizza was good!,1
"My daughter and I love Carrabba's.  We love the atmosphere and the food, of course.  I've had the chicken marsala, salmon and pasta dishes.  All were delicious.  We love the bread with the olive oil and herbs mixed in - so good.  On the rare occasion that I had a negative comment about the food or service, the management went overboard to make us happy. Could not be more pleased.",1
"Dr. Perrine is awesome - such a great guy and an excellent chiropractor.  I've seen him for several problems, and all of them have been corrected.  I had horrible sciatic pain during my last pregnancy, and he worked with me to correct the problem.  One of my ears was stopped up for a month, and I tried everything to fix it!  After a few acupuncture treatments, it opened up again.  Nothing else had worked!I highly recommend Dr. Perrine - whether you have a problem that needs to be fixed, or whether you want to improve your health - go see him!",1
"Fabulous guys! Very friendly and knowledgeable. Went out of their way to explain what they were doing and answered any questions. Not only found and fixed a water leak, but replaced the old main water pipe from the meter to the house that was in bad shape. Put in a master valve (which I didn't have, for some reason) and even removed my old useless water softener. They made my water system more efficient and did it quick! Thanks, guys!",1
"We were a little apprehensive about actually going inside the mall once we navigated what has to be the worst kept parking lot I've ever seen, but darn we were glad we did. The owner (I assume) was super nice and guided us to the #6 pork sandwich. Absolutely amazing sandwich and it was less than $5. I'll probably order two next time. Highly recommended and I will be going here at least three times a month.",1
"Hello! I would love to say that I never really want to get cleaning services just because I really never felt comfortable with people coming to my home , but I had heard from word of mouth the  amazing things about violets cleaning services. I can say that I'm very happy with the decision I made , especially violet , down to earth woman and also funny :) thanks ladies for cleaning my place ! Def will call them back",1
"Stopped in here while visiting Toronto, the staff was so helpful! The selection was wide and there was a lot of good stuff to try. I liked that they had samples and they were open late. The shop was buzzing with people. The sales person took their time with me and helped me pick out the best wine, it was fabulous!",1
We go every morning when the weather is good.  Be prepared to have your butt kicked without the chance of falling down and hurting yourself.  You might be tempted to turn around half way your first time but the hardest part is at the begining.  Awesome Urban Hike! (Your kids will probably make it half way unless theyre experienced hikers.  My 5 lb chihuahua made it about that far before needing water),1
"Super Bowl Sunday.... was amazing at MVP Raw Bar & Grill! This was my second time visiting the MVP Raw Bar & Grill and it was even better than the first time. The MVP has a great mixed atmosphere with outstanding customer service. They really know how to show their guests a great time and give attentive first class customer service. For Super Bowl they had an amazing buffet type spread with a complimentary drink that was included with the admission. The food, service, atmosphere, and Mac & Cheese was amazing! They even had several raffles.The wait staff was very friendly and professional. They made sure the cups stayed filled, the food was hot, and the table didn't clutter. The manager  even stopped by to make sure everything was to our liking. This party and my experience at MVP consistently exceeds my expectations!! Do yourself a favor and head over to MVP for a great time and the best Crab Legs ever!! I know I will return....again and again ; ).",1
Been coming to this location for about a year! This is always a great and fast option if uour needing sometiing healthy and fresh! Im glad they lowered their prices and change the menu so you dont get bored of same thing. Great job salad and go! Keep it up!,1
Here to try new menu items and cocktails. Kasai-tai is the best cocktail in town. Rum based. Oh yes. Yummy! New menu items delicious.,1
Dr Bob and his techs are incredible.  They always make sure my babies and I feel welcome.  They take amazing care of the animals and I'm so happy I found them.,1
"So, so sad to see this place has closed. We were lucky enough to have two meals here, and they were both wonderful. It's a shame that the owners didn't give it more time. I can only hope Davanti Enoteca resurfaces in some other manifestation in the future.",1
"What can I say, I wanted to go to a place with style, and this is it. The appetizers (butter squash raviolis) was a suggestion from my server, and the fish was fabulous. Everyone there was top notch, and professional. I'll be back.",1
"Absolutely love, love, love Grandview!!!! We decided to take my stepson for his 9th birthday (he wanted to party in Vegas) to Vegas. We took my other stepson that is 4 and my 7 mo. old lil boy also. Their service is impeccable! So from the beginning.... we have previously visited Grandview in January and fell in love so knew it would be best place to take our lil ones. So we booked it September 25 thru October 2, for their two bedroom suites. We could not make it out Sunday, so I called in and let them know we would be there Wednesday night. When we arrived we were greeted by Stefani and she became Grandview's greatest asset in my eyes! She booked us up quickly and gave us a room close enough to pool and far enough from other guests so in case my little ones screamed we wouldn't bug anyone. She also let me know about their complimentary high chair and small fee for playpen for the entire stay. We right away took advantage and got both. She also gave us list of all activities and best things in area. We spent most of the time in the pool seeing as how one is cold/fresh and the other is heated so perfect for my little one. The rooms were magnificent and are totally great for families seeing as how you got double of everything. So we stood in one room while some of our other family that joined us stood in the other room. We had enough privacy and all the guests are super nice and genuinely happy to speak to everyone. Huge kuddos to all staff!!!! We definitely will only be coming back to Grandview. We are planning an adult trip next year and their rooms and amenities are the best I have ever seen. The fitness center is wonderful, and activity lounge is great also. We really took advantage of the fact that food 4 less is down the street so I did all the cooking which saved us a bundle. I really recommend this place and super huge thanks to Staphani and the rest of the Grandview staff. Will definitely see you sooner than later!!!!!!",1
"These guys are awesome , easy to get along with did what they were supposed to do no extra charges no hidden fees showed up cleaned up after themselves. I've rented the green bag from the big box stores and there's a lot of hidden charges I have had dumpsters delivered and they're very expensive. Happy Junk lived up to its name highly recommend their service",1
"This is one of the best restaurants to eat Korean- both taste-wise and money-wise. I never leave with an empty stomach! They have two options- you can either order all-you-can-eat or just order items from the menu. During lunch hours and at night (after 10pm), they have a cheaper menu for all-you-can-eat for around CAD8 whereas the normal menu is around CAD12. They offer a variety of beef, pork, chicken, fish, and a number of small korean appetizers. If you choose to order items from the menu, they offer korean lunch boxes which are pre-cooked for you by the staff. They have a lot of staff but it tends to get busy so they may take a bit longer serving you. However, it is a great place to socialize with your friends and cook your meal together.",1
"The phrase that comes to mind when describing this place is ""quality not quantity.""  This place is Amazing! i loved it! I can't say enough about it.        The food they had was everything that I love.  They had a lot of the type of sides you would find at like Ruth Chris's. The presentation on these dishes was so cool and unique, like the little Chinese takeout boxes.   I was in foodie Disneyland, so far this is in the top 3 buffets for me.  The other two great ones are at the Wynn, and the Buchannal at Ceasars.  Wicked Spoon may be my favorite though.  When googling buffets, another one that's supposed to be great is the one at the M Resort.  Let me tell you, that was a huge dissapointment - mediocre. This place is LEVELS above!!",1
"Awesome location, beautiful hotel, great dining options and staff is over the top in how they treat their guests that's a good thing.",1
This is my favorite sushi restaurant! I have never been able to find better sushi than this (even as I've travelled)!!,1
"I absolutely love this restaurant! Not really a lot of room to sit down and eat inside, but not a problem because I will usually sit at their table outside, eat in the car, or grab dinner to take home.  The fired chicken, mac & cheese, and cabbage is my good to meal.  Everything is so flavorful and hot.  If you order the fried chicken prepare to wait just a few minutes, because they fry it to order.  Also make sure you try the jalapeno cornbread, its almost cake like with a little kick.  Can't wait for my next Soul Central meal!!!",1
"Just moved to Las Vegas from Seattle, WA.  I did my research and visited a number of gyms (LVAC, EOS, Lifetime, etc.).  Yak's Fitness is bar none the best one I've seen as far as equipment and cleanliness.  Both Chris and Shelly are true professionals.  Looking forward to my workouts :)",1
"Great shoe shop and my wife loves the deals they have on purses, shoes, perfume, etc. I am a bargain hunter, so some of the shoes I buy usually have defects. Johnny and his crew always get them looking new and keep the repair cost low. They truly appeal to my frugal side, but do quality work. I would definalty recommend them to anyone who needs a shoe repaired, or handbag or luggage too.",1
"Sitting outside on the patio on a sunny day is absolutely a must. It's the best water-front patio experience I think I've had in the T-dot. We had a group of about 12 and ordered several drinks and appetizers to share and it was all delicious.It's not cheap. but I was lucky to be treated, so we kind of splurged a lot :)The poutine was deliciousThe pizza was greatThe Nachos with chicken was amazingThe drinks were greatThe waiter was nice, too :)I mean, it's not the best food ever, but they have a great cocktail menu and it's so awesome because of the excellent patio. Sooooo worth checking out and the bigger your party, the better.",1
"This place was in the cutest little shopping center. I wish it had been a nicer night because their patio looked so nice. We had queso and salsa- both great and not too spicy, I honestly do not love queso but here it was amazing. I had 2 ground beef tacos and yum I wish I had ordered like 7 more. Pretty cheap eat!! Will definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte!",1
Good staff and delicious schwarma's I haven't tried anything else other than the chicken Schwarma but it's fantastic best Schwarma i have had in Durham,1
"Looking for some old-school fish and chips? Look no further than Olde Yorke Fish & Chips! Most importantly, save some space for their precious apple crumble for dessert.Just a bite from our full experience review.",1
Our AC died late monday afternoon. I called Hays and they were able to send out a technician by 7pm to get it fixed. At first he thought it may be the condenser fan motor but noticed that it had recently been replaced. Steve T did some more troubleshooting and found that it was just the defrost circuit controller board that had failed. Finding the real issue he was able to get the unit up and running and get our house cooling down again. Steve saved us 800$.,1
"Amazing food and large portions ! The service is great, food is delicious (especially the shawarma and burgers and fries). Great family run business with amazing food ! Lots of place to sit as well even when busy.",1
"yummyyyy so good! i'm so glad there is a fast food for vegans :) burgers are good, but the popcorn chicken and the strawberry milkshakes holy crap they are SO YUMMY!!! love this place, i hope they open up more all over!",1
"This place is always my favorite! I love it so much, I use to always come here after school when I was super young (: they have the best burgers! I think I even like it better than In&Out",1
"I haven't had a pet since I moved out here with my lifestyle and travel I felt would not accommodate a pet. Two years ago one of my neighbors left behind a cat when they moved out (so sad please nobody ever do this) The average life span on a stray Cat is 2 to 6 years although statistics will vary.  This poor little guy came up to me after awhile and was so hungry I fed him, needless to say we adopted each other. I needed to find a vet and get him checked out, a friend refered me to Sunrise Vet Clinic, Dr Henderson.  It is a older clinic but if the Dr is good I don't mind.  He was so nice, kind and gentle to my kitty.  So I recently had a abscess on my KitCat I've never seen that before so I texted my friend she gave me the number to call of the receptionist she returned my call off hours (I dont know if this is normal) she made a appt for before opening hours to get KitCat in to get help. Again he was so kind and gentle my cat wasn't even scared while he was being examined.They have been very understanding about payments and let you know about the options of different drugs and prices of them before you pay.The clinic is out of my way and a bit older but nicely kept and the people who work there are amazing.  I think it is worth it for my new best friend and his comfort.  I will definitely be back with my KitCat",1
"Great quality food and a nice, variable menu.  Service is friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant.  My only complaints are the hours (8p.m. closing time is too early) and the bread is terrible (it's literally store bought Wonderbread).  More effort should be made to bake fresh bread.",1
"Definitely the best EDM venue I have ever been too. The club is visually stunning, I have never seen anything like it. The Cirque performers put on a show that is unforgettable. The whole club is crazy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to Vegas",1
This was a great show. Highly recommend. Top notch performers. Every place you sit is a good seat. Very kid friendly as well.,1
"I have gone to this location a few times, my husband & I like to incorporate massages into our self care routine as taking care of yourself is super important. Every time I have gone, I have received AMAZING service all around, from the receptionist to the masseuse. Not to mention the place is soo cute & full of good vibes. I'm not really the type to write reviews, but, after receiving a massage from Lucas, I just HAD to. Best massage of my life, hands down!! Lucas used the perfect amount of pressure, which was shocking as i'm super sensitive & massages can turn a little painful really quickly for me. His hands worked magic and I felt sooo relaxed afterwards. Definitely my go to place from now on! (-:",1
"I don't like pizza. Never have. But........ I love this pizza!!! The staff put their heart and soul in the foods that they cook. Pizza crust is killer! Ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I love the California Dreamin' pizza. I also loveeeeeee the chicken wings- best in Cleveland. Service is great. Very clean. Workers keep the place spotless- they take pride in their work. When the weather is nice and it is warm, I love sitting outside, eating, and people watching. Roma is on point.",1
"Valley Air Works has saved us from a house without AC twice now. Seth is friendly, honest, and punctual. He came out as soon as he could on both occasions, and showed me exactly what was wrong and what he needed to do. If you're looking for an affordable, honest technician, then Valley Air Works is the place to go. I always recommend Seth to friends in need on social media because I know he'll give them the best service and price. Thanks again,The Sloan's",1
Coffee is good and quick but the pastries and goodies are super fresh and amazing. They must have a bakery on site. Open 24x365 so you can always satisfy a naughty urge for ice cream and pastries.,1
Quickly picked up and delivered to my destination. Clean and tidy inside. Driver was pleasant and helpful.,1
Outstanding pizza. Got the XL with sausage and pepperoni. Attentive and friendly service.,1
"I always go to Tampa whenever I am in Las Vegas for a business or for leisure! I went there last night for dinner with my guest from India and we had again wonderful experience. Jaspreet really took care of our orders, cook made perfect food adjusting the spices to our request! I have recommended this Restaurent to all my friends whenever they visit Las Vegas and I will continue doing so!",1
"I came in, unexpectedly, on a Tuesday morning. Father/Son team. Father is clearly the nicest man in earth. He was able to sneak in my tire repair in 15 mins. Unbelievable. He truly made my day. Highly highly recommend!",1
"What a wonderful experience all the way around! If you appreciate good sea food and steak, this is definitely the place! Worth every dollar! (And you might need a few to eat good here) amazing service, food, and atmosphere. I highly recommend the Atlantic caught salmon, caprasi salad with fresh tomatoes, and their lobster tail is out of this world!!!! Whoever we're in town, this is our dinner spot! Never fails everything is excellent!",1
"This is my second Industrious office space experience - been with them for well over a year now. The environment is friendly, staff is beyond helpful. You have everything you need in an office space, plus so much more. If you are considering a co-working space, you absolutely need to check them out.",1
"Excellent food! Attentive service :) The house Korma gravy was dreamy and the vindaloo packed the perfect kick. The naan was pillowy soft and perfectly spiced. The owners were friendly, and when my engineer boyfriend expressed an interest in the pictures of architecture on the walls, they were glad to discuss it with him :) We can't wait to come back and try the buffet!",1
"This is the spot if you want a clean , professional tribal tattoo. Wayne was AWSOME .. He accommodated my appointment around my flight in and out of Las Vegas. He listened to what I wanted done and gave me even more with his talent . I also got to see Mo do a full sleeve that was amazing. My son and I will be heading back to get full forearm sleeves in December . The shop is conveniently located 5 min from the McCarran airport . I stayed at the Hampton Inn which is 5 blocks from the shop and there are places to eat within walking distance from the shop....",1
"Been wanting to try this place. I love crepes so I gave it a shot and I'm very happy I did!I ordered a Nutella Crêpe with strawberries and bananas. As well as, I ordered a hazelnut iced coffee. It was all really good. Definitely worth a visit.",1
"I had an urgent need to get a leakinig toilet base repaired ASAP and Lawson Plumbing provided excellent scheduling and follow up. Craig was sent out today and arrived early to meet my husband's work schedule. Craig was very knowledgable, efficient,honest, and clean which was so important as the wax ring seal had failed and was leaking sewage. Craig was extremely patient with clean up and did a fantastic reinstall as well as easily addressed a failing inside tank filler. I have used Lawson in the past and wil continue to do so due to outstanding customer service and plumbers, like Craig. Thank you, Craig and Lawson Family Plumbing!!!",1
"My first time at Hash Kitchen with friends! It is a whole vibe! We had a group of 10 and Domenic made sure we were well taken care of! Absolutely love the staff (extra attentive)!! And the food!!!! Banana Split French Toast was amazing! Good came out super fast and fresh! The ""Build your Own"" Bloody Mary Bar has everything including meatballs from The Sicilian Butcher and fried Ravioli!!! Great mimosa menu! Definitely the place for Brunching Out! Cant wait for Hash Kitchen Peoria!!",1
Yum. The Dillinger burger was very good. They don't have pickles for the sandwiches but who cares. You can compensate when it is really good. The Dillinger style hot wings were good too.,1
"We went here for my birthday celebration and I wasn't disappointed. A great view of the city with contemporary decor (nice change from the stuffiness of other longtime Mt. Washington favorites)From the flavored popcorn to the variety of fresh breads the meal was off to a great start. Everyone in my group enjoyed their starters (baby kale, watercress salad and sea scallop), entrees (chilean sea bass/special, line caught halibut, butternut squash ricotta gnocchi and filet mignon) and the variety and creativeness of the mocktails and cocktails. Our nine year old rated the dinner 100 thumbs up :)Table service was attentive We plan on a return trip!",1
The new osheas is awesome! Love the atmosphere every time!,1
"I have been here twice now and both times have been amazing. The staff is always so nice and will help with recommendations if needed! The food is drool worthy.  The first time I had the bless your heart grilled cheese, it's absolutely amazing. The second time I had a single burger and their beef tastes so fresh. It's a perfect sized burger. The fries are so good as well, perfectly coated with the Parmesan cheese. They are a good addition to the meal. Hot Mess Burgers definitely has my business! Thank you guys for being the best!",1
My second visit to this location. Love the food and the service. Meats are very good and they come out fast. Salad bar has a lot of choices as well as rice and beans.,1
"Love Webb! Really nice to have fine dining in little ol' Gastonia. I took my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday and he truly enjoyed it. He had the Voodoo Shrimp & Grits, while I had the Duck Confit. We finished with the Pineapple Upside down cake Cheesecake. Everything was cooked to perfection and the staff was very pleasant.",1
"Learned about this place by chance but I'm so happy I did. There's not a lot of good options for good craft beer up in this area, bottled or tap. This place is great though! Tons of beer in bottles from all over, and a great selection of taps to fill up growlers or growlers. I'll definitely going back to this place multiple times!",1
"JaBistro is probably one of the top sushi restaurants in the city - and I was very excited to be able to try.I arrived at 7PM with a reservation and was seated at the Sushi Bar.  This was a pretty neat place to sit as you go to see the chefs make their sushi as well as blowtorch their sushi.We were given a menu, which consisted of sashimi, blowtorched sushi, specials of the day, and hot food items.  The service was pretty good - our waitress was a little bit aloof but very friendly nonetheless.  We would probably expect a little more given how high-end the restaurant appears to be.  Attentive to our water levels - but mixed up our orders and offered us a dessert menu when our mains have not all come. 1) Sashimi Platter: Consisted of a mix of tuna, scallop, mackerel, trout and others.  The fish in the sashimi platter is very fresh - one of the best in the city.  We were also given a sweet soy sauce and a housemade soy sauce to dip.  A great mix of fish of wonderful quality overall.2) Ebi nanban: Deep friend shrimp to perfection - the batter is well seasoned and not too heavy.  The tartar sauce was just divine - but I'm a sucker for tartar sauce.  A pretty good value of a dish for the restaurant as it came with 7 shrimps.3) Ebi oshizushi: The blowtorch sushi series is their claim to fame and I completely understand why.  The Ebi Oshizushi is smoky with a well seasoned shrimp. On first glance, it may seem like the rice is quite hefty, but it works well with how flavourful the shrimp is.4) Salmon oshizushi: The salmon oshuzushi is also wonderful.  I loved the jalapeno addition to the top and gives it a nice kick.  5) JaBistroll: Lots of textures with the fish roe, uni, salmon and snow crab.  It is a party in your mouth.6) Horse Tataki - Rougher than a beef tataki but gives you a great chewiness.  I loved the sauces that it came with especially the sea salt sesame oil. 7) Uni - Wonderful, tasted like the sea without an excessive fishy taste.  We thought it was a lot of wasabi but it worked well with the uni.  Beautiful texture.8) The Aji and the Yellowtail was also wonderful.9) Finished off with a green tea mousse that I enjoyed quite a bit but it wasn't exactly out of the world in my opinion.  Good strong matcha flavours with a scoop of pretty good vanilla ice cream.   As you can tell, I am quite impressed with JaBistro.  No way to sugarcoat that it is a pricey spot to have sushi.  However, it's definitely worth it if you want your night out to include a great sushi meal.",1
"This place is our favorite place to take the kids. They understand how to treat people and keep the kids happy! The food is good, beers are cold and the candy bowl for desert is a nice touch. They just get it!",1
"AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE! My family and I are from Orange County, so we're pretty picky with our Vietnamese food but the food here is just as good as the ones back home (if not better). The service was rather fast as well and our server is very accommodating and hospitable. We will definitely come back whenever we're in town from now on.",1
"We ordered take-out because the wait was too long. Our 5 meals took about 30-40 minutes to make, which is understandable considering how busy it was. .... AND THE WAIT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT! I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with ground pork. This must be eaten with the magical fish sauce that comes with it. Once mixed in, the meal is extra delicious and has a unique taste to it. This is the best Thai food I've EVER had. I am definitely going to go back!!",1
"We visit grand electric regularly. I've tried lots of other taco joints in Toronto but I always return to grand electric. They consistently have great, friendly and quick service and amazing food. The fish taco and pork belly are my favourites. Best part about this place is the prices are super reasonable.",1
"Excellent food. Excellent ambiance. We had live jazz playing and we all got the Julius Caesar salad, which was amazing! Also got some fruity drinks. Really loved the service.  A nice fancy spot surrounded by beautiful plants right off the water in old Montreal. Will be back!",1
"I fly in from San Francisco just to go to this MedSpa. The staff is great and the results last. I was really nervous the first few times but everyone made me feel at ease and I couldn't of been happier with my experience. I felt educated about my options, didn't feel pressured into anything and got last results. I recommend this place to all my friends.",1
Came down to the pawnshop to look at some goodies. Worked with Dom and manager Matt. Both outstanding guys. Come down here. They have some bomb deals going on. I give them both 5 stars.,1
"Yesterday my car windshield got hit by a rock off a truck as I was getting off the Summerlin Parkway on Buffalo off ramp. It was a quarter size chip, with the crack continuing to grow.I originally went to Fabulous Freddy's for the chip repair to my windshield this morning.  Lucky for me their service person is flaky and wasn't there. I called another place and had to leave a voicemail.I finally decided to give Safelite a call.  They took all my insurance information over the phone and scheduled me for a nearby location on 2055 Rainbow.  I was amazed by the results. The crack in the windshield is virtually invisible, except for a small dot. Considering the size of the initial chip and the crack the results were amazing.  Luckily also because of my insurance it didn't cost me anything.The only regret I have is that I didn't go to Safelite first, because once I got there it only took about 40 min. BTW, I've had chip repairs done at Fabulous Freddy's before and their work just doesn't compare to Safelite's awesome results.",1
"Genuinely great service each time we've been here, paired with delightful drinks and great food.  The octopus appetizer is particularly recommendable.",1
"5 STAR! 5 STAR! 5 STAR!Wow... What else can I say?If you haven't been to Cafe ZuZu - what are you waiting for? I was sorry it took me so long to get there!!The amazing, talented Chef Sean created wonders on a plate...Seared Ahi - DeliciousTruffled Grilled Cheese - OutstandingAsian Pear Salad - Perfection(That was course #1)Brussel Sprouts Au Gratin - MmmmmCrab Cakes over Cheesy Grits - SpeechlessLamb Sausage - Oh so goodMussels - Seriously the BEST I've ever had (anywhere)!! (That was course #2)Tropical Iced Tea w/Fresh Mint & a side of Simple Syrup -  Refreshing(Could not fit another course in... will have to go back for dessert!)Well, enough about the food, let's move on to the atmosphere. Very cool, very chic, very retro (50's). We could not stop thinking & talking of ideas on how to bring more people here, i.e., family, friends, large gatherings, work parties, etc. We want to share the feeling & the fabulous food we enjoyed here. Not to mention, they try to source local, have fresh herb garden right outside the kitchens back door, and mostly made from scratch! The service was personable & friendly! And we hear they have a great happy hour during the week, which we will definitely be back for!The team that put life back into the Hotel Valley Ho & Cafe ZuZu is genius! The place is simply impressive. A gem tucked away that should be admired, enjoyed & taken to the next level! GO NOW! =)",1
"St. Patrick's Day Sunday 5pm.  Finally, a positive out and about experience today.  The fish and carnitas tacos were fantastic.  Margarita was half price with top shelf tequila Don Julio.   Who would've thought Mexican on an Irish Day?  Me :-).",1
"My wedding is not for another year but I decided to drop in since I was already visiting some friends in Vegas. I tried on about five dresses and narrowed it down to two, however decided to sleep on it because it was my first time trying on wedding dresses, and I still had an appointment later that day with a different bridal boutique. That night, I kept thinking about the two dresses I had tried on at Brilliant Bridal and returned the next day. Dana, who was my consultant for the entire process was really patient with me, and even pulled a couple new dresses for me to try on so I wouldn't have any second thoughts. Again, I was stuck between the two amazing dresses I had fallen in love with the day before. I can't believe I was one of those annoying brides I'd seen on TV who just could not make up her mind! Two other consultants and the store manager even walked over to help me make a decision. They told me to try both on again...I must have tried each of them on about 5 times. Finally, Dana asked me which dress I felt fit my personality more and which I could picture my fiancé saying ""that's my girl"" when I walk towards him down the aisle. That's when I knew, and said yes to my dress! The boutique has designer dresses with really reasonable prices. I doubt I could ever find the dress for this price some place else unless I were to buy it second hand. I'm so excited to be able to check the wedding dress off the list, but also that it's so unique that I have never seen something like this on any bride I know (will post pictures later)! Everyone working here was just so sweet and seemed genuinely happy for me...not because I was finally done with my appointment but because I was so ecstatic about my dress and my wedding. Not once did I ever feel rushed or pressured to make a purchase. If you're in town, I highly recommend booking an appointment here.",1
Their Alabama White sauce gave me LIFE!!!! I had it on 1/4 Smoked Chicken and LET ME TELL YOU! I swear my tastebuds started square dancing! 10/10 would recommend!,1
These dounuts are so fun.  The make them to order.  I am sure custome design is something they would be happy to do.  This is my fist visit and my favorite is the coffee flavored ones.  Well i also love anything maple as well.  This place is great for kids too.  They have a step stool for kids to see all the sample dounuts they have designed.  This place is a must.,1
"One of the best events in the area. Great selection of chocolate treats, wonderful shops and awesome bands! Try to come on the Friday or Sunday, Saturday evening is extremely crowded!",1
"This was good...like taste buds doing the cha cha good. I got the supreme ACP excluding a few veggies. The chicken was succulent, steak beyond tender,  shrimp cook perfectly, and most of all seasoned extremely well. Definitely a top notch pick. I'll be back later this week for a to go dinner lol",1
Greatest burger around. Super atmosphere.  We were able to sample a beer before ordering. I will definitely go back.,1
"Hands down this is the best Thai food place in Vegas, I live in Henderson and drove twice to this place in  a week. I have lived with a lot of Thai people and overcame an ex-Thai gf. I have eaten a lot of Thai food in the past and I know what is authentic Thai food taste like. Lotus of siam or those few Thai restaurant in commercial center got nothing on this place. Portions are good, price is very decent and food taste's great.",1
We dropped into this spot for an afternoon drink and food. Not disappointed at all. The ambiance was perfect and the bar facing the outdoor seating gave just the right balance of air conditioning to fresh air. The drinks were perfect. Food phenomenal and the service was seamless as we were there during a shift change. Very well managed establishment.,1
"We found the restaurant on a flyer within our hotel! Looked on Yelp, and saw the comment about make a reservation and get a Groupon, so my husband and I did just that. Called at about 6pm and still got a 9:15 reservation. Parking was a bit difficult, but we will know better the next time. However, they do have free valet, we just didn't want it. Once we got there, we were seated immediately. Tables are close together and you typically have to sit across from your company but that was ok. The waiter came to our table promptly, and we had water and bread in no time. We order and it was delicious! The food was prepared fresh, and cooked perfectly. We ordered the Duck and the Blackened Chicken and Fish! We literally ate every bite down to the sauce. We took home some Bourbon Bread Pudding and that was delicious as well! I suggest this restaurant only to people who love great food!!! Will be going back asap!!!!!",1
"I am so happy since Bell's BBQ opened near me, i have been searching for quality BBQ since moving to Las Vegas 28 years ago. This is hands down the best in Las Vegas. Their Beef Ribs are cooked perfectly, tender meat with a good bark on the outside. Baby backs are also excellent. The fried chicken isn't bone in but the strips they serve a fantastic. Great selection of sides, and even though they are sometimes out of one or the other it is just a testament to its being prepared on site and fresh. Delicious food, comfortable space, and attentive service. I'm a happy customer.",1
"Absolutely my favorite dining experience in Las Vegas!!!  The food was amazing, and the view at corner table #56 has to be the best in Vegas--it centrally overlooks the Bellagio fountains and all the casinos in both directions along the Strip. Reuben was our waiter and his service was top notch!  Cesar assisted and was wonderful as well. Do not miss out on this experience!!!",1
"Arturo, was great to deal with. We were setting up for a graduation party and the garbage disposal broke down and started leaking. Arturo was able to take care of the problem with a new disposal at a fair price and save the party.",1
This is one of the best kept secrets in the east valley. The service here is Amazing!! Allison served us and the owner gave us great advice on the Cordon Chicken Schnitzel. Also you need to make sure you try the Pierogi Starter.,1
"I decided before leaving a review that it was important that we went to a few classes first, our daughter started it go for it as young as possible which is 14 months old. We put her in gymnastics because she would do somersaults also technically referred to as rollovers quite frequently at home by herself and we wanted to encourage her fire but also encourage it in a safe environment, around trained professionals. She is enrolled in what is referred to as my buddy and me, a class for parents and kiddos together until she's around 3. You can tell by their level of accuracy, attention, and smiling faces when you walk through the door that this Gym has instructed hundreds of aspiring gymnasts since it has been opened and though an older building it's huge, great equipment, and fun family atmosphere in the waiting room with other parents and family members. Our favorite teacher is Ms. Dana, mainly because for our little one to be often the youngest in the class, she's pretty encouraging with all of the students and helps us to understand a healthy gauge of what she should be able to accomplish around her age and how we can help her, all I can say is any feeling of nervousness or apprehension putting our young child in gymnastics was washed away when we met her and that's worth it. I personally couldn't say one thing I dislike about this gym, all the teachers are great and all offer something new and fun to bring to the table. If I was looking for a good start when it comes to gymnastics in the northwest or north Las Vegas side of town, this would be it.",1
"Nobu was pretty much the definition of an amazing dining experience. Our waiter was friendly and his suggestions were on point! The food was simply delicious. It is definitely along the more pricey side, but what the hell, you gotta splurge sometime! I can't quite remember exactly what we had because we ordered quite a lot! However, I do remember that their mochi was the best I had ever tasted. They had several different flavors, they even had a pumpkin flavor. That one was my favorite. I'll definitely be back!",1
"This is not your average pawn shop.  The building is new as of fall 2012, the shop is sparkling clean, and the merchandise is fabulous.  I had never been inside a pawn shop before my visit to Max Pawn, so I had no idea what to expect other than what I've seen on TV pawn shows.This is THE place to get high-end handbags and designer items.  All merchandise is verified to be authentic, cleaned if needed, and appropriately priced.  No fake, dirty purses here.  Another awesome thing they do that I just found out--they will verify authenticity for you for Craigslist deals.  So when that girl on Facebook says she'll sell you her Louis bag for a great price, meet her here and have the experts check it so you don't get scammed!  They don't even charge for this service.The staff here is really knowledgeable too.  They're more like the staff at a high-end department store than used car dealers, so get that image out of your mind. :)I didn't have any experience with the pawn or loan side of it, but I did see some people come in and they looked pretty happy with their transactions.  Collateral loans make a lot more sense than any of those payday loan places though!",1
"We live in central Phoenix so we drove about 9 miles west just for Chilli's bbq ribs. We ordered the 2 person platter with honey chipotle chicken and a half rack of ribs, double corn and paired with a presidente margarita. Food was delicious as always and we received great service at the bar area. Definitely worth the drive.",1
We love this shop. The tram here is always so friendly and they always treat my Son and I amazing. We see Oscar every time but all the guys are kickass.,1
"It's just that good.  Sure ""The Quad"" / ""Imperial Palace"" is a craphole, but you have to look past it.  The fact that my friend barfed on the casino floor on his way to the bathroom, well....that's just icing in the cake!  It sure wasn't a reflection on the delicious food.",1
"Needed some help with my GFI outlets, and came across My Handyman Group who had a lot of good reviews.  I contacted Daniel who immediately responded, and did a great job at a very fair price.Daniel takes a lot of pride in his work, and if you are looking for someone who is fair and won't take advantage of you...call Daniel!",1
"Make reservations if you want to sit down and take your time, but you can also order dinner from the bar.We had a plane to catch, time to kill, and happened to be in the Bellagio.  I don't know why.  But on previous stays, the water feature had been enticing, so we pulled up a couple of bar stools and started a tab.It seems to me that by the end of the evening, we had ordered just about everything on the menu.  I know that we ordered from every section of the menu, and sampled a version of every pretty drink that the other bargoers had in front of them.  (The bar staff was incredibly personable in a dry, bartendery way.  They knew a lot about a good drink, and had a handle on all the food, too.)The upshot is this.  I'll try just about anything once.  My husband's Asian cuisine preferences extends about as far as General Tso's chicken, and the word ""fusion"" is like kryptonite.  And HE loved every single thing that we ordered.  I'm pretty adventurous in ordering but picky when eating, and I loved every single thing that we ate.It's about as expensive as any other nice restaurant in a hotel on the strip.  And you'll probably have a better time if you don't show up in your cargo shorts.  But, when we go back, I bet we'll sit at the bar again.",1
"this is a good spot to get boba in phoenix. tho they do not have some higher quality tea infusions such as rose or lavender milk tea, their teas are flavored pretty decently. their boba is chewy and fresh and consistent. they also have wifi and outlets for you to plug in your laptop. tho its not the best place to sit and study because the blenders get irritating after a while.",1
I've been seeing Dr Fulton here for a couple years and love this place. The office is modern and comfortable and the staff is great. The same staff is here for several years and you can tell they enjoy their jobs which is awesome! The first time I met Dr Fulton she sat with me for 20 minutes explaining how I could beat the genetics of my not so great teeth. I have referred many family members here and they are also pleased with the service. Also I don't have dental insurance and they have their own dental plan that is extremely reasonable and equivalent. Highly recommended Feldhake and Associates- you will not be disappointed!,1
"I have used and recommended this company for several years now. All I can say is, they are awesome. Dependable, careful, courteous and friendly. I recently made the mistake of letting my contractor use someone else (we were in a pinch) for some work on one of our properties. The experience was so bad that I called Mike and he quickly bailed me out of a potential problem. Lesson learned. I knew I should have called them first but let someone talk me into what could have been a disaster. I highly recommend this company, we have several properties and my wife is also a realtor that uses him for her clients. They have never let us down and we've never had problem they couldn't fix.",1
Great place for eating lots of yummy food. Definitely top 5 in las vegas. Has the better appetizers than most kbqq places.,1
"Went here for a quick lunch break with a Coworker and left fully satisfied.   Even though they were packed we got seated promptly at the bar.  They had an amazing menu and who can beat their $5 drink prices?! We ordered the Corn Dog Poppers to start and they were delicious! We also ordered the #22 drink, it was prefect and sweet.  Wthen ordered our main course, the Porkwich Sandwich. It was finger lickin good!  That gold sauce and bacon really added something spectacular to the sandwich.  I cannot wait to go back and try something new!  (:",1
"I found this new AYCE sushi joint by fellow yelpers. Thanks!! I still like going to Umiya and Sushi Koma, but I felt like trying out a new place. There were about 4 tables filled with guests on Friday at lunch time. Service were a little slow at begining, but very friendly server workng hard by herself. There Nigiri cuts are a thin cut and longer compared to other Sushi places. The ratio to fish and rice is perfect, it was so long that you could completely wrap the tiny rice ball with fish, so your rice don't soak up the soysauce too much.Uni and Amaebi were very fresh and melts in your mouth. I had a baked lobster roll and the amount th sauce on top was not overpowering the roll. The sign stills says Kabuki, I am guessing they will put up their own sign pretty soon. This place is so much better than the place acrossed the street and more fresh fish!",1
Todd at TH was responsive and knowledgeable.  I am a licensed mason and was looking for a quick detail to complete a project and he got it done for me in a timely manner.  He even offered to help out during the inspection.  A good experience and I would use him again on future projects.,1
This place is so prefect. We stayed here for two nights. The room was so clean and the staff was so friendly. Andrew helped us at the 24/7 gallery bar and coffee shop. He was very helpful and made us the perfect cocktails! Very close to our family's house so we definitely will be coming back to this hotel again in the near future.,1
Grand opening and it is yummy! Portions aren't huge but on par with standard Japanese fare. They have takeaway sushi and buffet style Thai too.,1
"My wife had a hair cut today.  She absolutely loved it.  Spoke about it for hours. Kai washed hair 2x, included oil to her hair and a neck massage. WOW! Enjoyed the entire experience.  Highly recommend",1
Great pizza. We stopped in after work and got a large extra cheese pizza. My friend loved it. We will be back.,1
"I went to the R&S Mattress right off the I-17 and Thunderbird near Best Buy, couldn't find that location on Yelp. Anyways, I have to say this was the most pleasant experience in shopping for furniture. I have had the same mattress for 10 years and all of a sudden the pump stopped working. We needed a mattress immediately so I did some research and saw that R&S Mattress had excellent reviews. I went in and spoke to Gary, he was super friendly and helpful. He asked what I was looking for and I said the cheapest Cal King, not memory foam because of the heat. It literally took me 20 minutes from walking in the door to purchasing a mattress (including trying them out, paying, delivery info etc). What I love most is that Gary listened to my needs he didn't try to sell me the super duper delux etc and he was not at all pushy, in fact I kept waiting for the ""catch"", but there seems to be none. Gary even offered to deliver the mattress that night because he knew we didn't have one to sleep on...WOW!!! You are not going to get that kind of service anywhere else. In an age were customer service seems to be lost, this company should get 6 stars! Great customer service, great price, and great delivery times.",1
"I will need to revisit to try red bean but the custard one was just a delight to eat. Perfect size and generous custard filling. Piping hot and fresh, worth the trip after eating Korean stew around the corner. Cash only, cannot wait to go back.",1
"Burgers were cooked perfectly. Tasted like it was grilled in the backyard. Owner was super friendly and the restaurant was super clean. Prices were a bit high on first glance, but after eating the burger- totally worth it!",1
"I had a birthday party for our 3 year old daughter on a Sunday 3:30-6 session. I can't say enough for the staff there. They are GREAT with kids. We only had a few people in our party, so they got the whole staff together in singing happy birthday to her. I've seen some posts concerning prices, but I thought they were very reasonable, and worth every penny for the service they provided. I will definitely go back when she turns 4. If you're wondering where to have a birthday party for your child, I'd highly recommended you consider Great Skate Glendale.",1
"Stopped in because we'd heard it was a pretty good place and just moved to the area.  I'm honstly mad that I have to been their sooner. This is the best pizza I've ever had!! We got the a meat lovers essentially, I can't remember the name. But it was AMAZING! Pepperoni,  meatball, sausage and bacon. Oh my word.... so good!!! Every bite was like Heaven! The crust was outstanding. Crispy with every bite. Perfect sauce. Can Not Wait To Return!!!  Am recommending to everyone!!",1
Great thai food. Hands down. Service is amazing and friendly. Now the food let me tell you it's fabulous and you can choose what level spice you want from 1-10. Wifey and I do level 6. Fresh food always.,1
"Can't say enough great things about Nick and his team! We were interested in obtaining quotes for attic insulation. Nick promptly replied to my online inquiry, made an appointment to provide a thorough understanding of our current situation and an estimate the following day, and scheduled the job for the next week (according to our availability). He showed up ready to work, took pictures to show us the completion of the job, and cleaned up nicely. His estimate was also incredibly fair, and his quote accounted for settling of the product. It's really nice to find honest, small business owners.",1
"Fresh, family owned, great local place!  Ice cream flavors change regularly, small batches, always full of flavor!  Waffles are fresh and Delish, a nice place to go for a special treat of ice cream sundaes!  It's an old fashioned mom and pop owned ice cream place with delicious products!  It's a win win!!",1
great customer service I love the new management team . when I got out my truck they greeted me and  asked how may I help you. I told them I need a smog check. While my truck was getting smog they checked my truck out and they said it been well maintained and come back and see them when you need service. They never try up sale me not one time.,1
I've had sushi from dozens of different chefs. This place is hands down the best. Chef is obviously highly trained. Perfect rice to fish ratio. Super fresh. Perfect consistency. Very good value as well. Hope you live or work close as you will be back regularly.,1
"I received three complimentary rides through a sponsored ad on Facebook. I decided to give it a try after seeing raving reviews on Yelp and am so glad I did! I love CycleBar Henderson that after three rides I signed my partner up as well. We each purchased the 5 pack ride that they offered for $49. I was blown away by how little it cost to ride in this facility. That's less than $10 per ride!The staff at CycleBar are absolutely AMAZING! All of CycleBar staff have amazing attitude, and all coaches push you through your comfort zone. The music they played was current and the studio is filled with Schwinn indoor cycling bikes that's very modern. I also appreciate CycleBar always reaching out to their clients via text message to remind or simply saying how much they've missed you at the studio. It truly adds a touch of personalized training. I absolutely recommend this cyclebar location and would be excited to see if they will be opening up other locations in Las Vegas area. Unfortunately, my stay in Las Vegas was temporary but CycleBar was able to assist with my fitness needs and exceeded my expectations. They also provide essential oil scented cold towels after every single class to everyone. How cool is that?!Shoutout to coach Madison, April and Liz - you guys are rockstars!",1
"My husband and I try and eat at Serrano's at least twice a month. We love the food (chips and salsa plus the fantastic bean dip), service, and most of all the price. Never have had a bad experience there. They are the best. Beth is the best waitress in AZ. We do not have a want when we are there. She knows how to serve and please customers!!!",1
"Awesome lounge and restaurant perfect for a Thursday afternoon HH!  Check out the extensive wine list, great appetizers and amazing entrees!  The pizza is solid and it is family friendly! Pestos at Ray and Dobson is worth every penny!!!",1
If you are looking to have your exhaust done then you should absolutely come here.  Flawless work done by a great staff.  Can't imagine doing business elsewhere.  I highly recommend you do business with them.,1
"Awesome addition to downtown Chandler. The staff is always friendly and eager to help, great space for hanging out with a friend or for doing work, and you can't order wrong. Particularly great if you live nearby and don't feel like making the trip to Scottsdale or Phoenix for an awesome coffee spot!",1
"Haven't been back forever and it looked exactly the same as the last time I was there. Although they did renovate but for the most part the place looks the same. The food is still authentic but it really sad they are closing down soon... For today I got the charcuterie board, bone marrow, eclair, and the sweetbread All the food was amazing I look forward to the new store they will be having and a sad good bye to black hoof",1
First off my surgery was some time ago ( 2/12/2014) and my follow ups have gone great. I wanted to do a write up since my expierence was AWESOME !  The upfront offfice staff is excellent. ( ashley) . They have since moved to 44st/Van Buren and the staff there is also good. . Robin was always my nurse and she was very helpful and informative. Dr Sheldon Martin himself  was my surgeaon and  right from the get go he set me at ease. I was very scared and anxious but that soon disipated. We ha da connection cause he is  the Arizona Rattlers team surgeon and I AM THE BIGGEST RATTLERS FAN !  Anyway i can recommend them ( and i have many times) it just took awhile for the review t comeThanksMichael McC,1
"The Mexican food here was off the chart! I got here for happy hour and they offer half price Gold Margs, and Tecate beer. The Taquitos are also 50% off! Score! I had the guac with the goat cheese and poblano peppers. The guac was excellent with the house made chips! I had the Chancho (boar) taquitos with the mustard crema. If you're going for dinner be sure to make reservations. I waited 20 mins for a seat at the bar!",1
I love this place! The owner and all the trainers are very friendly and definitely push you to work hard! Even the other members motivate you to work hard! I love it! It's been a great workout for me and I've lost 22 lbs! I highly recommend this place! Thank you Title Boxing!,1
"Ate here yesterday with my wife. It was an hour before closing but the staff were still very very welcoming. Erin, who was our waiter that time, was very entertaining! We really had a good laugh! The guy who cooked the food was awesome too! 5/5 will come back again for sure!",1
Stopped in around 8 on a Friday night with 2 friends.  No problem getting a table.  Service was excellent!  We were actually greeted by Ken Stewart at the door.  Steak was perfect.  Would definitely go back.,1
"On my road trip between Chicago and Adirondacks, I was so happy to discover this gem of a place! It was the only restaurant that served late nearby that met what I was looking for. Great service- they accommodated my low carb requests and then some! My burger was delicious and the green bean salad and dressing was sublime!  Great wine list despite it being primarily a brewery.",1
"Grimaldi's is without a doubt my favorite pizza ever. I wish we had one in Utah. I've search for comparable pizza to no avail. I go to the AZ or Vegas locations whenever I can. I just get the cheese pizza, but it's more like margherita since it's made with fresh mozz slices. Love, love, love thin crust pizza. I went to Chicago and realized how much I dislike thick crust pizza (Lou Manalti's) and it further confirmed that there isn't a better pizza than Grimaldi's. I did eat at John's in NYC a few times when I was a teen, but I don't remember if I loved it or not.",1
Staff was so friendly.... and my car was filled with alfalfa. The cashier was really nice. I had to wait in line for a little bit ( like 2 mins not long really) but since i waited he gave me my purchase for free. Well done on the customer service. I'll be back!!,1
"Read all of the reviews and thought, ""TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!"" But HOLY CRAP! They were AWESOME! I fell asleep while my feet and legs were getting massaged. Definitely recommend this place and I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in town! :-)",1
"Very great sushi and wait staff, all very accommodating. The ambience is nice with great music and lots of natural light. The decor of the restaurant was top notch. The food was one of the best sushi rolls I've ever had (rock n roll) and the fried rice was also very good. Over all, 5 out of 5, well earned, stars.",1
"The most amazing customer service ever. Went above and beyond to accommodate my requests, and recently updated their water filtration system. Best burgers in town. James Beard winning taste with fast food pricing. Great atmosphere for a date or just a nice lunch out.",1
The hours are wrong they are 10:00-4:20 monday threw Friday Saturday 11:00 to 4:20 and closed on sunday..best burgers and wings in town!!,1
"What a great experience with Gabe from One Shot. He came out exactly at the time he said he would, even called to make sure I knew he was coming and that it was still convenient for me. After explaining what happened to my washer, Gabe went to work on it. He found 2 issues, went and got the parts he needed and the repair was complete in a little over an hour. He even ran a load of laundry to ensure it was fixed.  The repair cost was very reasonable and about $200 under what a ""well known"" service company quoted me over the phone.This is the repair guy you are looking for- absolutely fantastic!!",1
"If you are in terminal A this place is great. My hubs had the poutine with braised beef and he says it was excellent. I had the peanut butter and bacon w banana appetizer. Oh. My. Lord. It was absolutely delish. Definitely something I have never seen on any menu anywhere. It is heaven if you are into sweet and savory food combinations. My son had the grilled cheese, that was just regular and it was a slice of american processed cheese. A slice of any other cheese that was actual real cheese would have been better for an adult. It comes with a tomato soup. But overall, great place to eat.",1
"As good as it gets for food and beer!  We love the Refuge and the DC Mountain IPA.  My husband and I visit for lunch monthly (maybe more) and have never been disappointed by the food or the service. Must orders: PB&J Burger! Waffle batter onion rings, pulled pork sliders... Although everything on the menu is stellar.  Also, if they good the cook wrong on the burger or anything is not the way you want it they make it RIGHT - which is rare at most places today.",1
"Really great pasta, not sure if their squid ink was just a special but I hope they consider doing it more often",1
"Gents, this barber shop does it right! Not only do they offer haircuts and shaves, but they also rock a full bar and ESPN on large TVs. These guys are onto something...I had never received a shave before, and I was pretty apprehensive. I mean, I'm supposed to not only trust a stranger holding a blade to my throat, but PAY him for it too?!? Maybe this is where the booze beforehand comes in handy ;) Nevertheless, I decided to go for it. My barber, named V, was awesome. He did a great job and quickly put me at ease about the whole razor thing. I probably won't be getting weekly shaves anytime soon, but this shave was a MUCH enjoyed luxury and I look forward to coming back. My face had not felt that smooth since I was 13.I also appreciated that Evan, the owner, was walking the sidewalk and chatting with customers and passersby. Nice to see great, old-fashioned customer service. Great barbershop!",1
Great service by Doreen at the front desk and Dr. Cordova.  Amazing staff.  They treat you like a human being should be treated.  Will highly recommend to people that I know.,1
"Ok so this is a hard one for me because I have to admit to MY frailties as a human haha...but this place IS the place to go!!! 5 times!!! Yes 5... 5 separate accidents or incidents, 5 separate vehicles, over MANY years Gerber has ALWAYS hooked me up right. With excellent customer service & great body work! From new rides to used... I HIGHLY recommend them...all locations but I prefer their HENDERSON/Boulder Hwy",1
"Air is simply the best. I've had what I thought was very very good Thai massage before, and she blows it out of the water. She is incredibly talented, but she's going to put you through the ringer. It's going to hurt, you will grind your teeth and clench your fists, there will be moments when you pray it's over. This is not a pleasant, relaxing, easy massage. But trust me it's worth the pain. Finishes with a full chiropractic routine, I'm leaving feeling 10 years younger.",1
My mom's 70th and my son's 23rd birthday cake. Thank you so much pink bandana for doing exactly everything I asked for and making this cake a huge hit and our family party,1
"Once again the guys here impressed me.  They are friendly, and really experts in vehicles, beyond just alignment.  I trust their judgments, and am amazed when they go through all the work of alignment setup, only to be told ""no charge"" when the alignment is still OK. They will stay in business a long time with their attitude to customers.  Try them. You'll like them.",1
The service and food is always fantastic. I have never had a bad dish here. I highly suggest their specials. The last time I went my group enjoyed cheese stuffed with... you guessed it another cheese! I truly don't know how they keep such a large list of specials but I love it! This is a great place for a date or small groups,1
"What a great place to build self esteem for kids. My son made cool Rocker friends at School of Rock and even started his own band (Good Boy Daisy). They have gigs all the time and making a name for themselves. I have to honestly say, if it wasn't for School of Rock, there would be no band. The staff is top notch and makes everyone feel at home. Be ready for your kid to loosen up!",1
Old school bar feel. Super friendly staff! Been going there for almost 10 years. LOVE THIS PLACE. The food is good too.... rare find. A real shame Jimmy is leaving.,1
"Had the beef ribs and felt like I was in an episode of the flintsones it was sooooo goood!!! The jalapeño guys were to die for, and the pecan pie is so feicken good too! Love this place",1
Great job at a great price finding both a short term and long term solution. Recommend totally.,1
"This is a wonderful establishment but Yelp is hiding her best reviews. Look below for ""Reviews that areNot recommended."" Then delete the Yelp app. Don't let them do this. (I'll bet Yelp hides this review, too.)",1
"This review is only on the afternoon tea.  This is, hands down, my personal favorite place to get afternoon tea.  Why?  First off, this place is located in the Four Seasons (self-explanatory).  Second, due to the location of the Four Seasons (it is at the end of the strip) it is a more secluded hotel, and this restaurant is at the corner of the hotel thus making it a nice quiet spot from all the hustling and bustling of Las Vegas.  And lastly, the service as well as all the other desserts and sandwiches are simply top notch.  For example, even though there is an actual reason you need to reserve a spot in advance as they only make enough for the people coming, the staff was nice enough to place an extra order of scones for us to take to go.  They even packed extra jam and devonshire cream after we inquired as to whether or not they sell their jam to the public (which they don't or at least not at this location).  Furthermore, they have a medium size list of teas available, which is more than enough for me as I tend to stick with black tea when I do afternoon teas.  As for the other desserts they got the usual salmon sandwich, vege sandwich, chocolate cake, et cetera...  And yes this place is kind of pricey but really you are in Vegas and in a Four Seasons hotel at that to boot.  Definitely my favorite place for afternoon tea.  I always try to at least go every time I go to Vegas but I think their afternoon tea is only on weekdays so call ahead and make your reservation before you go.",1
"I wish I could give ten stars! Excellent service, professional, and knowledgeable. I would say that I'd love doing business again but i don't want these bugs again. Thanks Anthony!",1
"Great location, awesome menu options.  And wow the beer is a amazing, so many options! Staff is on point,  everything came out fresh. hot,  and was delicious. Recommend  the Halibut, any seafood dish, ahi  nachos, just about  everything  is not going to disappint. Great place!!!",1
Great food and a quaint feel to the place. The use of the purple rice was a really cool touch. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a decently priced lunch or dinner.,1
The food here is amazing with great service and excellent chef . You guys should try this Japanese restaurant out . This is my first time and I will go back here again . Thank you,1
"Had the skirt steak and Mac n cheese. Both were really good. Started with the chips and salsa, was a verde but still delicious. Had the gentlemen sunrise (just ok) and the blvd bullit (much better). Wife had Buffalo chicken quesadilla and it was good too.",1
Love this place! Been to two different locations and it's my favorite BBQ in CLT! Great options for Gluten Free!!,1
Last time I had a bad experience. This time was back to amazing. This place is true authentic Italian food. Chicken parm sandwich is my favorite. My wife absolutely loves the cheese cake.,1
"Love this place! Najat and Henry treat us like family. We live in the village and visit (at least) one per week. The sampler platter is our favorite and is usually filling enough for my husband and myself. Occasionally, we'll tack on a salad or meat dish, if we're especially hungry. Everything is homemade and delicious! The Beans Plaki and M-Jaddarah (bean dishes) are favorites from the sampler, apart from the Baba Ganoush and Hummus (both of which are awesome). Henry is always willing to make something special to accommodate our toddler. Tiny diced chicken, lamb, or beef with the house rice. The little guy gobbles it up! Honestly, everything here is good and we've tasted A LOT of the menu! Be sure to take home some of Najat's homemade meat or veg pies and some baklava! If you can sit and relax for a while, ask for some of Henry's Lebanese coffee. It's lightly sweet, scented with middle eastern spices. A real treat! You are missing out if you don't give this place a try! And did I mention it's BYOB?! See you there soon!",1
"Good service, good people.Baker's was recommended to me by a couple folks and I am glad they did.Did the job and at a reasonable cost.",1
I have been coming to this Barbershop for the last 4 yrs or so.  The staff there is very nice and efficient.  My boys love it and so do I. Their prices are very reasonable as well. AMAZING service!!!,1
"I've been to the Greenville, SC location as well and both locations have been an amazing experience. The service was great, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and omg these were fantastic. They weren't overly fried (I can be sensitive to fried foods) and the grits were a perfect pairing for the tomatoes. My entree was the pulled pork grilled cheese. My only complaint was the bread was so soaked in oil and that did upset my stomach almost immediately and made it hard to finish, luckily I ordered a side salad so I was able to make a good balance between fresh and greasy. I wouldn't say this is a major down side to the point that I'll reduce my rating, because most people are ok with this, but I just wanted to give a fair warning!",1
"Trend is something that must be avoided at all cost. The idea of a board game restaurant is not a force that could persuade me even if it offered free food. But when I heard that the menu was consulted by Jack Lee (not that celebrity chef who throws his thumbs up and pops his collar at every camera pointed at him [I didn't even know you can pop the collars on those chef whites), a rising star within the culinary consulting world, I decided to throw some money at this place.The real estate is enormous!This ""cafe"" (restaurant is more befitting) is immediately next to the Toronto landmark 'The World's Biggest Book Store', and I think some of that enthusiasm rubbed off on the people who designed this place. Clean, simple ambiance with a hint of sophistication. I was not expecting anything of this sort from a business that offers its patrons with potential heart attacks via the sound of collapsing Jenga pieces that can occur at any moment in time. Booth capable of seating four people (six if you're fairy sized) stretch across the south side window. There is capacity for over 110 people, what kind of cafe is this??I do struggle between the semi sectioned off Canadian Flag section and the huge sofa chair area. Both areas are very cozy and close to the main games shelf. I don't recognize much of the games here, I've only played Monopoly as a child, which probably explains my affinity with money. I also dream of owning a real estate empire. Maybe it is good that I didn't play snakes & ladders then, otherwise I'd probably be somewhere climbing a building for Green Peace.Italian soda in mason jars, various coffee and teas, seven dollar cupcakes?! I cannot be fooled by mere esthetics and inflated numbers; I ordered everything.Who is this Jack Lee?My palate yearns for more of his magic touch. My hats off for the chef who creates every item on the menu with obviously fresh ingredients. The quality of the food is consistently good, challenging my perspectives on certain foods that I've pointed with only my nose at before. Who knew a croissant sandwich with eggs and ham could be so bloody tasty? Smoked meat burger? Tiramisu coffee dessert? Why on Earth is this cafe not advertising itself as a restaurant instead? The name suggests a college hangouts, but everything about this place is on par with a fully serviced restaurant. In fact, this is what I always wished what an International Hotel restaurant would be. Drinks when I need it, good food on demand, highbrow desserts and alcohol.Oh yes, Roll Play Cafe is licensed. Why the hell isn't this place 24hrs and places like..well, any other 24hr place/s is/are. Indeed, this place is the 'Anti-other 24hrs place.' Only, it's not 24hrs. Make sense?I sound like a Western philosopher with all these questions. Allow me channel the Asian philosopher and offer some answers.Unbelievable culinary vision, romantic ambiance that I would take any of my fictitious sweethearts to, from the most exciting (Jenga) game, to the most mundane (Ticket to Ride). An ambitious menu that unsurprisingly attracts not only university students, but foodies throughout the city, a mean corn soup that restores the bad name corn has been given in this overly organic modern society, and seven dollar cupcakes.Don't let the name and concept be a deterrent. Roll Play Cafe is cooking up some serious business.There is a rumour that the owner is contemplating decorating the walls of the stairway ascending to the dining floor with artificial grass. I don't know what the hell kind of game he played as a child to think now as an adult that being a good idea, probably something 'educational'.",1
"Love this place for lunch. They have a little lunch buffet that really hits the spot. The staff is friendly and the place is well kept. I try to come here a couple times a month when I can. Great option for a quick sit down. Quality, well prepared, non fried lunch.",1
"In a word, this place is...AMAZING!  The prices are affordable and ambiance is really calming.  I found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out after work.  I purchased the 60 minute foot reflexology - and for 60 glorious minutes, I melted away into pure calm!  The cost is only $35 for 60 minutes, but if you purchase their membership, you save $ each time on each service.  I highly recommend it if you plan to come more than 5 times!  Well worth it!The 60 minute reflexology session puts you into a lovely, recliner chair...they put towels over your body, and you put your feet into a warm tub of water.  It's very sanitary, as they use a wooden tub and a ""new"" plastic bag with water for each new person.  They start massaging your head/scalp massage, neck, shoulders and then spend majority of their time on your feet/legs.  You are fully clothed, so it's very easy to just lay back and relax.They give you a bottle of water with each session, which is great to replenish after the reflexology process.Go there TODAY!",1
Had a few drinks at the bar and Chiara provided us with excellent service!! The cocktails were well made and the antipasto platter was a great snack. We will definitely be back!,1
"I met the parents in Toronto for U.S. Thanksgiving. This place is great! I would fly to Toronto, just to enjoy a meal here again!We all had the Cesare Salad. It is prep'd to order table side, fresh garlic and pepper are prominent. The waiter (Henri) was great, he explained dry aging to my mother (who isn't a big fan of red meat) as well as going into the regiospecific differences between the cuts we could choose from that evening. We ended up ordering a couple of larger cuts, from different regions to compare /contrast the differences in flavor. We tried the PEI bone in ribeye, vs a large corn fed no bone ribeye from Nebraska. As far as side dishes went, we only ordered the Duck Fat fries and a local kale sautéed with walnuts and blue cheese that was excellent!Both steaks came out cooked to perfection, the PEI bone in, a thicker cut was cooked medium rare plus, and the Nebraska Ribeye med rare, was prepared Pittsburgh style. Both were served in individual iron skillets and sliced so we could help our selves, picking and choosing between the two cuts. In Dallas, a great steak will set you back about sixty dollars at your better places. (Bob's Chamberlains, etc.) but spending $120 + on a steak at Jacobs is money well spent!I honestly would have been happy returning here just for a meal of appetizers...they all looked so great! Seriously, if you are coming to Toronto for a few days consider heading to Jacobs to have cocktails and appetizers at the bar one evening, get a feel for the menu and then have a top of the line steak dinner on your second visit!",1
"Carolina is still the only person I trust with my curls. I wanted to update this review because she now has a gorgeous new space in Salon Boutique. Carolina's warm personality and customer service always make me feel good, but she's really able to pamper her clients in her new space. Her skills and service remain top notch, and I look forward to seeing her every time.",1
"The food here is so fresh. The broth in the soup is one of the best in town. The decor gives you the feel like you are in Vietnam for just a moment in time. The staff is always nice, friendly, and makes sure you are taken care of.",1
"I've had the pleasure of dining here twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast. It's been a couple of years since dinner but only a month since breakfast. Details of the dinner are a little murky due to the passage of time and several bottles of wine we drank that night, but I can tell you it was spectacular. I could have eaten that entire foie terrine myself and what I couldn't eat I would have rubbed all over my body.  Is it bad that I ordered that again as a starter for my breakfast?  Probably. Too bad. I also had the quiche and some sausage. My friend had the American breakfast. Best ever.",1
I had no problems with the scooter and the guy I talked to was very nice..This is the only way to see Las Vegas strip.. now I can keep up with others and they brought it to the hotel waiting for me. Dropped it off at the desk.  Great cost for the time I rented it.  Thank you again,1
"These guys are great! I was looking for somebody that would pull my engine rebuild it and put it back in for me. I found the Engine House and that's all the farther I needed to go. Went down to see the facility Terry gave me a tour of the shop, they have all the machine tools you need to build a engine in house. They rebuild my engine and had me got on the road in two weeks! These guys have been in business for 40 years with an A+ rating at the BBB.",1
I love this place and have been coming here since they opened.  Never had a bad meal and the owners treat you like family.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy good Mexican food!!  I get the carnitas and black bean burrito and it has never failed!,1
"Incredible brunch location.  Bottomless mimosas an super tasty bloody marys.  Had the lobster hash.  Tons of fresh vegetables and lobster chunks, thick slices of crusty Italian bread toast and house made fruit spreads.  Decor and atmosphere is luxe.  They just popped the windows open for some al fresco fun.  Love this place.",1
"My husband and I have been coming to this location since it's been open and haven't had a bad meal yet.   The food is always delicious and cooked to perfection.I am writing this review because of the awesome customer service that I received last night.  I ordered takeout last night and was told it would take twenty minutes.  When my order wasn't' ready yet when I arrived at the restaurant, the manager apologized profusely and said that my dinner (and a diet coke while I was waiting) was on him.   I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though it was completely unnecessary it made me feel special and that he appreciated my business.  Such customer service is almost unheard of in this day and age.  This kind of service deserves a five star rating in my book.",1
"I love their name, ""Neighbors""! This place has stylish hip decor, they greeted us upon arrival and helped us navigate the menu. We choose the breakfast burrito and added bacon for $2 more, and the basic jack griddle cakes. I ordered the Queen Bee cinnamon/honey coffee. My husband and I both agree the burrito was the best burrito we have ever had!!! The pancakes were spot on as well, and came out with thawed butter (some places use cold butter which only makes my pancakes cold!). The coffee was delicious and perfectly sweetened. We will be back again!I would like to see a kids menu (we didn't bring our kids and I don't recall seeing one, but I could he wrong.) The bathrooms are also clean and nice!",1
"Really good Thai food...I liked it, My wife loved it, Service was awesome, Atmosphere was great as well.Worth a try...We'll be back",1
These guys have been great in all aspects of the purchase. They have always answered my questions and have been a big help. Highly recommend A+++++,1
"Dear Lord, this woman can work some magic with some thread. And she was funny. (""Oh, why are you tearing up? Don't worry, you won't miss that hair."")Online appointment scheduling, clean studio and work area, and reasonable prices are also big pluses.",1
"I have been a member here for over a year, for general fitness. Cardio, machines, some weight lifting. The gym itself is always clean, the equipment well maintained. Where Eos really shines is the helpful and attentive staff. Have a question or need some help? No problem. Always greeted walking in and thanked walking out. This really makes a difference for me.",1
"Had friends come into town last week.  My buddy Joe MADE ME make reservations for Raku during his visit.  I brought him there a couple of years ago and he always goes there whenever he's in Vegas.  I haven't been in a while and it was good to experience it again with good friends.We decided to skip the daily specials and go straight for the regular menu items.  As always, the asparagus, duck, and kobe beef were excellent.  For a couple of guys, they never had pork cheeks.  They were surprised at how flavorful it was and we ordered another round for the table.The food and service is always excellent here.  I have never had less than a 5 star experience here.",1
"Best pizza in Toronto! The Diavoli pizza is a most try. Service is amazing, waitresses are italian and are very warm and welcoming. The homemade hot peppers are AMAZING! (You can buy buy it to take a jar home). The prosciutto salad is also very nice and fresh. Great authentic italian restaurant!",1
"Diane at the front desk is so amazingly helpful, she really made a difficult trip so much easier for us. Just such a pleasant attitude and really did go out of her way for my dad and I. Thank you so much!",1
"Why haven't I heard of this place earlier!! Wanted to plan a dinner party for my birthday and was looking to try something different that offered dinner, cocktails, cool atmosphere and live music. After asking a friend Ross.Rabbit.Lie was suggested. And it was more then I could have expected.  I made reservations in advance for a party of 8.  No wait upon arrival. Our server was knowledgeable, quick, and attentive. The dining area itself was small but seductive. The best part is the entertainment. Without spoiling it you have to stay for the 12 o clock show. The fact that you don't know what to expect is apart of the experience. And the best part is I heard no 2 visits are the same. I defiantly will be back to find out.",1
"In my lengthy and desperate search for back pain relief I found massage envy.  As far as the establishment itself goes it's the easily the most professional and relaxing massage spa I found in Vegas.  I was searching for a therapist that could relieve me of my chronic back pain (lower and mid) I've suffering from for 2 years now.  Tommie was and has been my therapist ever since I walked into her room and she said I'd notice relief after the second session and have my life back after a couple more.  She kept her word and I am back to my normal everyday activities light and strenuous.  The pain was bad enough at one point I wasn't able to walk.  If you have back pain I'd highly recommend Tommie, incredibly knowledgeable and  accommodating and most importantly some sort of miracle worker.  Thank you Massage Envy and thank you Tommie!",1
"Breakfast  to a whole new level guys, it's like breakfast on freaking steroids. It was so delicious , the pancakes were so fluffy and delicious. The eggs were just right. Mmmmmm the bacon  was nice and crispy. Service nice a friendly, and yes I'll be here again to enjoy the food. But seriously though this is like IHOP and Denny on roids lol jk I'm just saying the portion is huge",1
"This Barbeque at this place is the best as far as I am concerned. We ordered the half of ""The Feast"" it consists of Chicken and Brisket and Pork Ribs. With me not indulging in ribs we opted for extra chicken instead. Sides included Corn on the Cob. Coleslaw and Potato Wedges. Grilled Pineapple Slices. Also, we got Cornbread Muffins. To drink we ordered a Margarita, Strawberry Lemonade and a Tall Ale. Our total came to $62.48. Not bad at all for a dinner of three, with a delicious bag of leftovers to take home. The Chicken was moist with a nice smoky flavor. So was the Brisket. The Coleslaw was cut into little pieces, this brought out the various flavors quite well. Cornbread was sweet but cooked just a little over for my taste. The Corn was average. Potato Wedges came out of the kitchen cooked just right and lightly salted. Delicious!!! The service was excellent yet unobtrusive. Just the way I like it.",1
"This review comes after a very poor experience at Earnhardt Ford. I went to Berge Ford to have them fix my truck. I had a minor navigation problem that they fixed. Joey in service set it up and Francisco followed through. While waiting,  I dealt with sales while i was dreaming of my next truck. No pressure, just a nice guy.  I came back for a second service call. Francisco took care of it and Kevin drove me home. There were a few things that took all say. Kevin, the driver came after hours to bring me back for my truck and Francisco was still there at 6pm with my truck waiting for me. Thanks  everyone.",1
"This is the best sushi place I have ever been. Whenever I want sushi, that's the place I go. There variety of choices are amazing. There flavors, spot on. I would highly recommend it.",1
Sat down at 530 om a Friday and was visited immediately. Derek knew the menu and beer list back and forward. My burger was done just right (medium) and the atmosphere was great. Watch out because this place is going to get busy if they keep doing things right like this. Couldn't have done better as a burger place,1
"Maize is closer to a fine restaurant than a storefront. This would be one of the top 5 Mexican places in Chicago, even.Everything is seared to a crust, exactly how it's supposed to be. Masa is pressed to order as sopes, tacos, huerachas, etc. Ingredients are generously applied, almost absurdly so. They have two salsas, and both are excellent complements to their recipes. Prices are low, you can eat like a king for under $10. Food comes out quick, in less than 10 minutes.Most of all, everything tastes phenomenal. This is a special place and I hope UIUC appreciates it.",1
"Finally giving this place a review after several visits. I've read some other reviews and thought I would give my thoughts. I would advise bringing water, sunblock, and comfortable shoes as there are two sides of the orchard. I would advise walking around both sides at first unless you feel pretty comfortable around the orchard. I constantly see people tearing carrots/beets out of the ground which are clearly not done. Same goes with fruits and if you don't feel comfortable just watch/ask others. You can probably find a ""how to"" video on YouTube that tells you what to look for in each produce.Yeah, they run out of certain items due to nature or demand. Just make sure you know what's in season before coming so you know what to expect. P.S. An orchard doesn't always mean apple. If you google the term orchard it's the intentional planting for food production. Just thought I would clear that up for some people.",1
Great home made food! I have eaten the western omelette for breakfast and the meatloaf dinner for lunch both so delicious. Service was so wonderful.I will definitely be coming back!,1
"The food and environment here are incredible. We ate outside and we allowed the chefs to bring us their best selection and it was way beyond what was expected. The wine they suggested was perfect to pair and overall it was our best meal while visiting for the long holiday weekend. For a nice, light, tasty, and unique dining experience, enjoy some dishes from Boxermans",1

"The food was good, but the service was OUTSTANDING!  This was my family's first visit to Mission BBQ and definitely not my last.  We were very pleased with our visit.  We entered the restaurant on a Saturday evening, as we stood back reviewing the overhead menu, one of the cashier's approached us from behind the counter and proceeded to walk us through the menu options and even offered samples, which we declined, but what a nice gesture.  We proceeded to place our order, provided our name, retrieved beverages from the self service station and just as we were about to sit down, our food was ready!  I ordered the smoked turkey combo with 2 sides (collard greens and corn on the cob), cornbread was included.  The turkey was perfectly seasoned, nice carved, and generously portioned.  The greens were on-point, nicely seasoned, as well.  The corn was just ok, nothing to get excited about, but it was fresh.  The cornbread was tasty too!  My husband had the brisket sandwich with slaw and baked beans and he enjoyed it very much.  My daughter and son-in-law had pulled pork sandwiches with slaw and fresh cut fries, and my grandson had a sandwich and fries from the kids menu.  There was a selection of 6 sauces on each table.  We each had a different favorite!  During our meal, several employees, came by to check on us.  What a great experience.  I will absolutely return!",1
"SO glad we found Phoenix Piano to move our piano for us.If I could give more stars I would; Daniel was so friendly and so very professional, and all could not have been more perfect. We decided to donate our piano, and they set it all up for them, and it's ready to be played again.Look no further; these guys are amazing! Thanks so much Daniel",1
They were very helpful when I brought three boys into play. It was their first time and they guided them through the process and made me feel comfortable about leaving them. The boys had a great time and were well looked out for.,1
"Fantastic pizza and really nice people that work here! So, you order in line and the servers bring your meal to you. The best thing is that if you want more food or beverages while seated inside or out, the servers take care you from the comfort of your seat. All you do is swipe your card and walla, they bring your order to you when it's ready. ·Bianca Pizza- Absolutely delicious!!!! I ordered the small to test it out and share it with my friend. Turned out to be big enough for the both of us! Nice portions! Will definitely be back for more!!!",1
"I had lunch here with my friends on Saturday. The food was good, tasty and presentation was beautiful! I'll be visiting again!",1
I was referred to Village Electric from a trusted mechanic that I have used for years. The customer service they provide is top notch. I called in to check if they could help fix my car as the problem was beyond my mechanics capability. The girl who answered the phone was very professional and did a great job. She explained that she would check with the technician and let me know shortly if they could take care of the problem.  After just a short time she called back and said that they would be able to take care of it and could even get me in that day! I dropped off the car and within 24 hrs they diagnosed and fixed the problem. I was very impressed with Mark ( the tech ) who was able to get my car back in tip top shape! I highly recommend working with this company they are honest and do a great job! Thank you all for running a great business I will certainly use you all in the future!,1
"I dream of Benny BBQ (I now live far, far away)...our family has loved this place for years. The chicken, the sauce, the piles of fries, the coleslaw....Great to order in or pick up.",1
Best Turkish place in town. Best meat in town. Staff are so nice. Really happy we discovered this gem!,1
Stopped in spur of the moment since the other restaurant was packed. This place was amazing and the flavor was out of this world. I would come back again. This is what hole in the wall means.,1
this place is awesome! We  just had our end of season Basketball Team party here and it was perfect.  Great staff clean facility. Very accommodating and great for all ages.,1
"Dr. Arnett and his staff are fantastic.  They helped us through the loss of our 8 year old Frenchie and they have been more than wonderful helping us deal with some unexpected health problems with our new dog, a rescue.  They took extra time with us when we had unexpected test results, particularly Brittany.  The front desk is also amazing, they know our pets and are always ready to answer whatever questions we have.  Thank you all!",1
"I have worked with and known Robert Duskin and his staff for years.  I have never known him to be anything but professional and knowledgeable.  I frequently use his expertise to understand difficult and potentially costly areas of the tax code.  He and his firm are highly recommended for their skill and hard work.Regarding the negative review, as a Certified Financial Planner(r) myself, I would hope that anyone offering tax advise would take a detailed financial profile including future plans that might affect taxes and finances.",1
Found this place by accident while out shopping. The beer selection was great. I loved the Don't be Hazed IPA and my wife enjoyed a nice margarita. The meat and cheese board was excellent and the burgers and Mac and cheese being served to others near us at the bar looked delicious. I'll be back and will bring home some of the brews they have on hand for take home purchase.,1
"What a great find in a cool neighborhood! We thankfully stumbled upon the Arts District in old Las Vegas...away from casinos and the strip. Wish we had found this area earlier in our trip! Rock'N'oodles is a small, cute restaurant, with a bit of seating for dining inside or outside. All three of us LOVED our dishes and the half portions were plenty. I ordered ""Bang a Gong"" which was Authentic chicken tikka masala, a creamy tomato sauce with garam masala, greek yogurt and cayenne pepper. Served with sautéed spinach and cilantro over orzo pasta. So delicious! We also ordered ""Nights in White Satin"": Linguine pasta with white wine, lemon juice, heavy cream and white truffle oil, with sautéed mushrooms, jumbo shrimp, a kick of red pepper and fresh herbs and one of the salad specials with chicken. It was really difficult to choose just one dish from the menu and the staff was super friendly and helpful as well.Definitely a must do in the Arts District!",1
"Absolutely amazing tan, lasted for about 5 days. It faded beautifully, was never splotchy. The tan overall looked like I had bathed in sunlight for a week, basically I'm saying it looked like a real tan. It was also fantastic service with the exceptional results. I was really nervous to get a fake tan, you see the questionable choices of the spray tan crowd walk around Scottsdale everyday. Don't worry, if you go to Platinum you will NOT end up like that. There's also an adorable lounge where you wait for your appointment. A million gold stars to you Platinum Tan!",1
On Sunday night I had a great experience at Aunt Chiladas. Not only were my fajitas amazing but our server Mario was also very gracious and took good care of my party. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in Phoenix looking for good Mexican food and a fun atmosphere.,1
"There is no better sushi place anywhere in Ahwatukee! Ra? Give me a break! Overpriced and sterile. Sakana? No thanks. Ginban? My favorite! My wife's favorite! We have only been there a handful of times, but today we decided to make Ginban our ""go-to"" place. The sushi is nothing less than amazing. Live scallop (a featured item), jalapeño yellowtail, tiger roll, takosu (octopus with asparagus)...all so very fresh and excellently prepared! The sashimi is awesome and the oysters (Hamahama and Kumamoto) will leave the most spectacular essence of ocean lingering on your taste buds! The people next to us at the sushi bar today got a teriyaki chicken that was almost like all the best parts of a sizzling plate of fajitas: sizzling (goes without saying) and the smell was wonderful! The Sushi Chefs are masters. Kenny, the Head Chef, is personable and takes great pride in his preparations. Vivian, the Owner/Manager is eager to please and very proud of her establishment. She also has given us the best recommendations to try new items that we might not have been so ready to order on our own. Stepping out of our sushi comfort zone at Ginban has been a most pleasant surprise! The atmosphere is low-key, quiet and very enjoyable (we have only gone during the late lunch/early afternoon time, which is very much our speed). The restaurant, itself, is very clean and the design is about as ""chic"" as Ahwatukee has to offer. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed. (If you have been disappointed, give it another chance, especially if you have the opportunity during non-rush hours.)",1
"Food was great!  Sushi was fresh.  Spicy pork bento box was way spicy and delicious.  They have non-rice sushi rolls!  They use black rice, not typical sushi rice.  Supposed to be healthier and lower in carbs.  The atmosphere was modern and very clean.  Service was great, quick and friendly.  So excited to have great sushi this close!",1
"Eye district by Jo is probably the best eye place I've been to. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by Joann's husband, due to her being away on a business trip. He was so helpful, offered me water while I sit and wait for the optometrist, Dr. Patricia to call me up. I got my eye test and then it was time for me to pick out my new frames. I ended up getting a pair of glasses and sunglasses. Although the sunglasses took a few days to make (they needed to send my prescription in to the lab), I'm so glad I came here. After a few days, Joanna was the one who called me letting me know that they are ready. I came in and tried them on, and she was so nice! Everyone that works here is so genuine and I love that they truly care about their customers. They do not pressure you at all, which is why I recommend this place to anyone. I'm so happy with my sunglasses. I love that it is also very unique and different. They all sorts of styles, plus they have Gentle Monster (if you don't know this brand, google it!).Thanks eye district by Jo! I will be back annually!",1
A definite must after a long night of partying or a quick bite before;)  Every time we've gone has been delicious!!! We've gone at all hours of the day and the crowd is pretty unpredictable. They're soo good that they're worth the wait TRUST ME!,1
"I wasn't expecting much when I found this place, as I've been disappointed by many small brewpubs in the past. I had never even heard of the place, but I saw it when I was driving by on Shea, and decided to give it a go. I got the Chinese Chicken salad and an Unpossible IPA. The salad was one of the best I've ever had! All the ingredients were fresh and were cut to just the right size. At some places, salads can be a pain to eat because they're inconsistently chopped, but not here. Every bite exploded with flavor! The IPA was hoppy, juicy, and paired perfectly with the spicy salad. Just as a comparison, it was very reminiscent to IPAs I've had at Cellarmaker in SF and Fieldwork in Berkeley. Service was good and timely. I'm pretty sure most of the staff work out at Crossfit or something. I can't wait to take my wife here so she can try it out.",1
"Visiting from San Diego and was absolutely satisfied with every aspect of our experience. Scrumptious bbq sampler, cauliflower steak and mac and cheese. Excellent service by John!! The Flapper spirit and Apple Pie moonshine took it to another level of satisfaction. We all agreed it would be worth a drive and a night in a hotel! Don't miss out!",1
"Absolutely the BEST manicure and pedicure experience I've had in years! Great atmosphere, and the clientele were fantastic too.  HIGHLY recommend Love Polish, finally found a nail ""home"".  Thank you to all of the wonderful ladies working there!!",1
King Insulation came out to our home which was less than a year old.  We had hots spots and were told that we did not have the proper ventilation to properly cool our home.  King Insulation came out and blew in new insulation and it turned out that our ventilation was fine.  We just needed proper insulation/better quality.  King did the work for a great price and we could not be happier.,1
"Loved this place!  Cozy and warm, great food and drinks and a knowledgeable staff.  They had a special whiskey that is $100 shot (can't remember the details) but it is a bottle that is only available once a year. (See pictures)The food was far above what I was expecting for ""bar food"".  The food was fresh and creative which was a double bonus.If you want a relaxing night and good food and drinks check out the Moose!",1
Great restaurant and great atmosphere.I had an awesome great time with friends.I loved the tapas and the excellent paella.I can't wait to come back soon.,1
Good place for Chinese noodle. Not too many option for their manu. But noodle is all you need. You can pick 6 different noodle which vary by width. I always go for thick one.,1
"You must go!  This place is fun and the food is amazing!!!  I have been here two times in the last two weeks and have not been disappointed at all.  This place has great customer service and the food is phenomenal!  I spoke with the chef and was told that the kitchen is a scratch kitchen, it shows in the taste and quality!  We ordered the french dip both times and we've ordered the spinach dip and nachos.  Did I mention that the food is really good?  We have told several people that they must go because the atmosphere is lively and because of the FOOOOD!  The rest of my group is looking forward to the craft brews to be served!  One day we hope to try bowling.  Also, they show UFC and hockey on the big screens :)",1
"Fondé en 1992 et j'étais là.  Alors que tous se dirigeaient toujours rue St-Denis, mon vieux prof de philo et moi finissions nos cours sur Épicure ici.  Dans le temps y avait pas de bouffe.  On allait manger en fasse au Tibétain pis on revenait se r'prendre une pint de Guiness et continuer nos nombreuses discussions sur l'état du monde et de la pensée.Combien de ""dates"" et rencontres spontanées ais-je eu entre les mur de ce Pub et Lounge énergisant et feutré?   Je ne l'ai compte plus.  Assis au bar à rire avec la barmaid, tu fais toujours des rencontres agréable avec le reste de la faune du quartier et d'aussi loin que Rimouski.Suis-je un meuble du PQL?   Je ne sais pas, mais malgré mes in et out de Montréal, s'il y a un lieu où je me sens comme dans mon Lounge (oui, oui, j'pas un condo ou un loft, j'ai un Lounge)  c'est bien ici!   Au PQL on se sens comme chez soi et même les nouveaux que j'amène ou rencontre ici ce sente bien.   Tous est magnifique et magique ici!  Le choix des bières, le fort pour les braves, la cuisine depuis 4-5 ans ne cesse de s'améliorer et est délicieuse.  Mon coup de cœur: Les pâtes aux pesto y pollo et mon préféré à partager la planche ""cochonaille""  Away!!!Que dire du staff et de leur boss?  Just wow effect.  Luc B est le 3e proprio que je connais depuis je viens ici et il est de loin le meilleur par son sens de l'entreprenariat et surtout son esprit et vision d'innovation.   J'aime l'évolution physique et aussi humaine du Pub.  Après 23 ans que j'y viens, je crois être en mesure d'être objectif.  Félicitations Luc et à tout tes partenaires et ton équipe!  Et quelle équipe!  Suprême WOW facteur!  De la Barmaid ultra pro, dynamique et ricaneuse aux chefs et aux gérants, everyone take care that you have the best experience ever!Je suis un Pubien Quartier-latinois depuis 1992, redevenu habitué depuis l'automne dernier et je souhaite longue vie à ce lieu culte et énergisant!",1
"I contacted GlassMogul and within minutes they had reached out to me to get my windows fixed. I had a very short deadline in which I had to get these windows repaired due to the sale of my home and they made numerous adjustments to their busy schedule to make something happen. Their representative was extremely knowledgeable, kind, and prompt. They get five stars easy. Thanks!",1
"I wouldn't normally write a review for a supermarket but I have to say both my husband and I were very impressed with a superior customer service. Excellent job from the membership counter to the check out process (super fast, efficient and they even spotted some deficient item).",1
"Alllll the way at the end of the Linq Promenade, Canter's was the cure for what ailed me - too much travel, too little food - on my first day in Vegas. It was mid-afternoon on a Wednesday. This time can be death to a good review. Not lunch but not yet dinner, shift change, nothing ready for quick service - Canter's overcame it all. The food came out hot, fresh and pretty fast. AJ, our server, was super friendly and perfectly attentive. I think he handled every customer seated at the time. We started with the chicken noodle soup. This large soup bowl was chock full of elbow macaroni, carrots, celery and shredded breast-meat chicken in an extremely flavorful broth. The only drawback with white meat is it can dry out despite sitting in broth, but every other aspect was worth it. It was served with bagel chips, which was a perfectly crunchy compliment. I think the item that gets top billing is the Rueben sandwich. A good-sized sandwich was thick with house prepared corned beef, Swiss, tangy Russian dressing on (again) house made rye. Delicious! Big enough to share for sure. The sandwich comes with a side of either potato salad, macaroni salad or slaw. We went with potato salad but ordered a side of macaroni salad. Both were creamy and well made. Neither was overly salty. I liked the macaroni salad a little better just because it tasted more like what we make at home. The pickle spears that came on the side were crunchy and tangy. The brewed tea was dark and full of tannins. Our water glass was always full. Canter's opens at 7 a.m. for breakfast, which is served all day. I can not wait til morning!",1
"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix.  I have taken several co-workers from around the world here, and they agree.  I do give Thai Basil, Thai Elephant, and Lemongrass 4 stars and I do enjoy all.  But, Tipps has great quality, good prices, and a diverse menu.  I have really enjoyed their curries, salads, pad thai, and noodle dishes!  Although the decor is pretty standard, they do have an outdoor patio which is nice for lunch.",1
"From beginning to end, ACSS was phenomenal providing service. When researching storage options, I called several places, and ACSS seemed the best and had reasonable rates for mobile storage. I was able to easily schedule drop off/pick up at point A and subsequently at point B where we moved. The staff at the office were extremely helpful and friendly providing service, and that same great service extended to the drivers too! I'm generally very critical about customer service standards, and hardly come across businesses worth sharing- ACSS is an exception. I recommend them, and would use them again for storage needs.",1
"I've always loved Hava Java- if I lived closer, I would prob be there daily and develop an addiction.  When I heard they had recently undated their interior I thought I would drive over and check it out. Upon entering, it was caffeinetastic to see the place packed. Each table was filled with someone typing away on their electronic device or chatting away. I loved the sense of coziness- like you could sit there all day if you should choose. Being summer, I decided to order an iced coffee and it was delish!  Just the right amount of flavor and just what I needed!I also loved the new bar area. Modernized yet still matching the existing decor. I also like how clean everything felt.  That's important for me anywhere I go. I think Hava Java has been around a long time. I can see why- and I see them being around for many years to come. Can't go wrong coming here for a cup of Jo. And if you check in on Yelp, it's 10% off your bill!",1
This is an amazing and delicious place to stop for a bite of great Italian pizza. We love to eat here and go all the time. The crust on the pizza is a perfect light and flavorful bite. Me and my family really enjoyed and will 10 out of 10 recommend. If you are very indecisive just make up your mind and come here.,1
I love this place! We tend to stop here after work for happy hour and enjoy their delicious guac and chips along with some delicious cocktails. The service is wonderful and the atmosphere is very cool.,1
This is a very nice Wells Fargo.  It is nice and big when you walk in and there are plenty of friendly tellers helping customers without hesitation.  This location is near several popular places and also in the same parking lot as a Bank of America.,1
"Manny, Lupe and Mary are amazing to work with.  They are very professional, efficient, thorough, and get the job done.  No headache, no worry, no hassle!  They make an EXCELLENT team and you can always count on them.  They truly work hard for you.  I did a lot of research and interviewed many property management companies prior to making my decision in hiring them.  Well, my decision was the best ever.  I'm happy, my tenants are happy and it's all thanks to this wonderful team.  I would highly recommend them and hire them for any of my future investment properties to manage.  Thanks guys for always doing a great job! Laura and Tony G.",1
Really nice place.  Order from the restaurant - same price as take away. You get a side salad with the panini Get a bottle of wine if 2 people or more.  We had a good server Gautam. I recommend this place over some of the others in T1 by D gates.,1
"Fantastic food and service. We entered just before the kitchen closed and were promptly offered seats. The bartender was happy to make suggestions, and his gnocchi suggestion was spot on. Best meal in Montreal and excellent service as well.",1
"I am a total fresh veggie geek. I have three vegetable gardens of my own, countless container gardens, and I'm always plotting for new spots to grow my own food all around my house. Bless my patient husband... In spite of my constant gardening endeavors, I am always looking for new veggie sources. Poplar Ridge Farm is simply amazing. Poplar Ridge Farm is a completely organic farm located on 90 acres in Waxhaw, NC. The owners are passionate about sustainability, organic food, and educating and feeding their community. I have made the drive from Charlotte a couple of times to check out their Wednesday afternoon farm stand and I recently attended a delicious farm to table dinner located on their beautiful property. Amazing! Poplar Ridge Farm hosts open houses throughout the year to tour the farm and they also host farm to table dinners about four times a year using fresh-picked ingredients from the farm, prepared by a local chef. Our dinner last night was prepared by Chef Justin Sells from the new E2 Emeril's Eatery uptown - so good - can't wait to check him out at the restaurant. The meal he prepared for us was gorgeous and absolutely delicious. If you are interested in weekly doses of this veggie goodness, Poplar Ridge Farm also runs a CSA - Community Supported Agriculture - and they have over 100 shares of food going out the door every week. Central Charlotte is not too far north for them ... there has been enough interest in our area to get some delivery drop-off spots in my area. Check them out if you are interested in fresh, organic produce and beautiful herbs and flowers!",1
"My girlfriend has a timeshare here, for the price you can't beat it. They have all the amenities you could ask for and are close to South point Casino.",1
This place always does amazing on my car! My kids spill in the back seat & they always clean my carpet so good! And they clean my rims extremely well I never leave here disappointed  they do get really busy so if u don't wanna wait a long time go early!,1
"I love this place! The new owner Jen is so nice every time I come in and Tina, the woman i've been going to for years knows exactly what she's doing, she takes her time and does exactly what you want, if you're looking for good prices and great nails definitely come here",1
"Best Thai food in Vegas...the best! Unbelievable fresh spring rolls and the Wonton Soup, simply the best!",1
"There are not enough good things I can say about this company as a whole. I've been a loyal customer since I got my first car (and my parents before that have been too). Not only are they extremely knowledgeable, They just ALWAYS take care of you, they care about your safety and they just use the best practices overall. I wish there were more locations sometimes, haha, but that still is a non issue because they have descent hours and always have quick service. I stopped in for my free tire pressure check today and pulled right in, was approached right away, the guy told me my tires were a little too full of air (I got an oil change last week at my dealership, which they check). I'm so glad I got my email reminder to stop in because otherwise I would have never thought two things about it! Thank you Discount Tire!!!! You're the best and have a loyal customer in me!!",1
Mexi Mocha is yumtastic!!! I have now visited the two locations I am aware of in Las Vegas no less than ten times. Their coffee is yummy and I hope they expand. I would venture to say they have the best coffee  in Vegas. Fantastic!!,1
"I see why they call it good company, cause it really was. I decided to come in for a quick bite alone and the vibes were just right. Everyone was very friendly and helpful with menu items. I tried the vegas heat and strawberry banana smoothie. Both were very tasty. I'll definitely be coming back to try other stuff!",1
"We come here pretty frequently (almost weekly), and have never been disappointed. Not sure what to say, other than every dish we've gotten has been excellent and high quality. The service is always friendly and top notch.Great burgers (recommend their gouda); terrific pizza (highly recommend the peppadew). Never been disappointed in their sandwiches, including their hot roast beef and rachel. For apps, we really love the fried pickles, buff chicken dip, and all of their wings.This place is a hidden gem. My only complaint is the lack of seating when they are busy!",1
"My family loves JinJin! Sweetest people that own it, they always take good care of us, and the food is delicious.",1
"Overall:  The best mediterranean restaurant in Vegas, Milos offers pure, natural tasting food combined w/ great ingredients.  Fish is flown in fresh, daily from around the world.  The chefs skills are truly shown w/ pure, un-adultered dishes, mainly seasoned with salt and pepper, sometimes olive oil, and at most w/ a reduced balsamic vinaigrette. NOTE: Both times, the chef customized our menu and we didn't have to choose items from the main menu.Setting: Dinner with a friend, Monday 08/22/2011.  We were lucky they had a 2-top available, as it was MAGIC week.Thumbs Up: You can't go wrong by leaving it up to the chef (omakase in Japanese restaurants).  But if not, must gets are: the octopus (so tender, crisp, and yummy); Milos special (eggplant and cucumber chips w/ tzatziki sauce [make sure to mix it up and dig out the tzatziki as it cuts through the saltiness]); cooked whole fish (we had red snapper, and was very fresh and delicious); service staff if very helpful - don't be shy to ask any questions, and even take a tour of the fish being displayed.  Their service staff had good recommendations on wine pairings w/ the different seafood dishes.Thumbs Down:  Nothing.Tip: Most of the bad reviews are a result of not being seated for a 2-top.  This is a family style restaurant where most tables seat 4 or more.  Try to come with more than 2 people and you'll be seated much faster.",1
"George is our guy and he always does a great job. He takes his time, explains what he's doing, and never farts in our house (that's my job.)Thanks George!",1
"Love this place!! Everyone is so knowledgeable and they make you feel welcome. My first time here they didn't make me feel awkward (I was nervous and idk why). I brought my dad for his birthday and it was fun lol. This is the only cannabis store I will ever go to. Their knowledge:  My mom has been suffering from nerve and back pain due to an injury and I was looking for information on topicals, cbd oils, edibles and different thc levels and never once did they make me feel anything other than welcome. The lady who was helping answered every question I had and NEVER tried to up-sell me anything!! Client for life",1
I love this place!!! I'm from Los Angeles and came here twice while on vacation. Everything is super fresh. Bring one to Orange County!!!!,1
I've  been going to Mr. Mama's for well over 3 years and it gets better every time  I go. Kat is a joy and always friendly double checking in everything. She put the word manage in manager. Denisse my waitress was spot on  as she  took excellent care of me. Otis and Jordan checked on me several times making sure my glass was always full and  dirty dishes were off the table. I've  brought people in and recommended  to many many more. Thanks Mr. Mama's (Nick) for creating such an AWESOME  establishment!!!!!!!!,1
"This a fantastic, slightly less crowded ""branch off"" spot by the Pacific East owners. The menu is simple, but consistently good and the portions are large (enough for two meals). The workers could not be nicer and were happy to point me towards some options when I was feeling indecisive. Compared to Pacific East, Pacific Grill has more of the Asian comfort food I grew up with, making it a go-to spot for quick Chinese!",1
"This is one of those not quite hidden gems of the Wexford neighbourhood in Scarborough. It's out in the open but not unless you go around that area or know of people who have been there, you can often overlook it.The location is in a small plaza right beside a Karaoke place and a PAT supermarket.Their service is alright but often lacking and more than often understaffed. Most of the staff that do work there are friendly and try to get to you ASAP when they are busy. So one word of advise, just be patient with them; it's a small place that sometimes only have one floor person to work and man the cash register.The interior is wooden and almost home like. Food quality is superb. I've come here so often that I have had the chance to try several of their food items. Some of my favourites are the pork bone soup, tofu stew, dol-sot bi bim bap, bulgogi and galbi. They give you plenty of side dishes that are made to serve on that day (so every time you come there, it's always something different!). The best part is that the side dishes are refillable without extra charge.The menu is smaller than most Korean restaurants I have been too but it's so straight to the point that they are able to focus on the quality of their food that they serve. Love this place and would recommend this place to anybody that is looking for quality Korean food!",1
This place gives you a bigger portions than other sushi burrito places. They offer two proteins not just one. I wanted to stop here for several weeks when I first saw it and I finally did and I wasn't disappointed.  I will definitely be back.,1
"This place is the best I come here all the time! The employees are great and the dinning room is clean, though it does need a remodeling sense many other Burger Kings I've gone have already remodeled and made it fancy!",1
"I loved this place! I was excited to see it replace the Revolution bar and use the space to create a more exciting place to relax. I liked that there are large tables and board games for groups of people to entertain themselves,  and don't understand why people are complaining about having to walk (50 feet max) to the back to order food.  The sliders were AMAZING and the Korean Spicy wings were great. Our drinks were also spot on. I do acknowledge that the food and drinks are a bit overpriced, but it is Vegas and their happy hour prices make up for it. Overall this is a great alternative if you aren't into the club scene and still want to be in a social environment.",1
Great customer service and great coffee! Baristas were always friendly and even remembered my dogs name each visit. Definitely check them out!,1
"Kevin is amazing, he's very informative and honest to a fault about ACs. He provides competitive quotes for brand new ACs and is an AC repair wizard. I wouldn't go to anyone else with ACs and you shouldn't either.Service was great, he works real hard and is one of the most friendly people ever. Nothing but thumbs up for Kevin, he puts the customer first.",1
"On Sunday I discovered that my cat was very ill. My best friend's mom uses Vets to Go and she recommended I call them, as their costs are lower due to the lack of overhead. She also gave me a card worth $50 off my first visit. I rarely go to the vet because my cats are indoor cats, and when I do - it's often stressful for the one that was ill. He was a nervous Nellie and didn't really like strangers, especially in a clinical type environment. I called Vets to Go on Monday morning and they booked me in for 3 pm. A bit later I got a call and they asked if I minded if the vet came earlier. (I never have an issue with that! haha.) Dr.Jody came promptly at about 5 to 2. She came in and came downstairs and looked at Winston and diagnosed him right away. The diagnosis was awful, but Dr. Jody was very professional. She let us know about all of our options, she made several phone calls to get me as much information as she possibly could so that my ex and I could make the right decision regarding the well-being of our cat. Unfortunately we decided to go the rout of euthanization. Dr. Jody was amazing. She comforted our cat, and gave us words of comfort and encouragement. I've had to put a pet down before - but never a pet that was solely my pet. It's always been the childhood family pet. So it wasn't my decision or my responsibility. This was very difficult and it could have been much worse if the vet was cold and uncaring, but Dr. Jody was awesome and made me feel a lot better. I highly recommend Vets To Go, especially if you have nervous pets. But also because they typically cost less, and they're awesome. I will be using them for my other cat, and my dog. Thank you Dr. Jody & Vets To Go for providing me comfort when making a hard decision.",1
"Fair, Friendly - no smoke and mirror gimmicks. Greg Fazakas is the best I've ever dealt with. I was treated with respect and sales games weren't played. I appreciated the experience and was happy to do business there.",1
"I picked Bottega Ristorante for my birthday dinner and I am so glad I did. This place went above and beyond for every single part of the experience: the food, the service, the interaction with the wonderful owner Nick, and even the free birthday cannolis were all exceptional.Let's start with the food: it was explained to us that all the items are made in-house, using fresh quality ingredients imported from Italy and you can DEFINITELY tell that is true. I had the Strozzapreti Norcina and it may legitimately be the best pasta dish I've ever had. All my friends also loved their dishes and desserts. The free bread was marvelous and they had a wonderful spiced olive oil (which I've never seen before) that was incredibly flavorful with an actual substantial amount of heat. The birthday cannolis, besides being delicious, came out with a sparkler and were amazingly presented - easily the best birthday dessert I've ever been served.Next, our waitress, Jennifer, was amazingly attentive and gave us all the information we were looking for. She checked up on us frequently, the drinks were never empty, and the free bread came out quickly and often. She was a joy to interact with and overall one of the best waitresses I've ever had. Nick D, the owner, came over to chat with us briefly and handed us two cards for free appetizers, which was awesome.If you like incredibly authentic, fresh, and high-quality Italian food along with a wonderful atmosphere and impeccable service, then you need to try Bottega. A true gem.",1
"I used to be a Starbucks employee... DB changed my life and how I view coffee in general. The staff here is always hyped up and ready to go. I can go through the drive thru crying, and they always get me to smile before I even get my drink in hand. Yeah, the guys can seem a bit flirty, but don't take it personally, I know from experience that it's all about that tip life! I love that you can actually taste the coffee in any of their beverages; it's not just sweetened flavored milk with a bit of coffee in it. My favorite beverage is a Double Chocolate Mocha Freeze and I love to add caramel to the bottom of the cup for a nice occasional surprise through my straw. For a hot beverage, I love the Cocomo. Get it with almond milk to get an Almond Joy flavor.",1
Best Filipino/Hawaiian food in Vegas! Local family owned business that will treat you like one of there own. You're guaranteed to leave with a full belly and a smile!!!! I know I did :-) so go check it out!!!,1
Pleased with the service and the product! Purchased these for the staff at a local hospital and they really enjoyed them.,1
"Bill, the Mgr. offers excellent customer service. Went in for a oil change and they found a leak on a radiator hose. They do a through check with their oil changes, was shown where the leak was and my resivoir was empty. No scams here this business is very trust worthy. Give the guy a raise",1
"Delicious, affordable, and great service. Their pancakes, oatmeal, and orange juice and absolutely incredible! This is our favorite Saturday morning spot!",1
"Mark is a great member to your team, thanks for the great customer service! We ordered 3 dishes and everything was devoured.",1
Totally recommended. Huge selection of beers and vinos. The copper penny bar is a nice contrast to the wood and chalkboard walls. Place was crowded and loud. Nonetheless I enjoyed my time and service I received. Fair value on beers. Can't wait to see how they perform again.,1
"Wowzers. I'm very impressed by the way this restaurant is run. The lunch line is always long, yet I'm never waiting for a long time to be served. The employees get you going with a nice attitude and very quick service. And the taste in each order is superb!! The food taste better when the A/C works better though! Hot pizza and hot room don't go well, but they're the best thing at Park Central! :^)",1
"Found this place on yelp. Didn't think it would be good, but decided on trying it out based on the 4.5 stars review, which sometimes can be wrong.We got there 30 minutes after they've opened and the place was pretty empty. To my surprise the place quickly filled up shortly after we were seated. We sat at the counter and had a nice chat with the chef, which was from Shanxi, China.The noodles were awesome, we finished everything! Brings back childhood memories. I will be coming back next time I'm in town.",1
"Simply put, Troy is the Most knowledgeable and honest professional I've met in this industry, hands down.His communication and response time are above par.""Thank You!""",1
"Seriously some of the best bbq in the area.  Everytime my family comes fine from Indiana, we have to order food from here.  I live about 20 minutes away, but it's worth the drive to me.",1
"Excellent workmanship and easy to communicate . A complete redo of old irrigation. Completed in expected time, clean up excellent Good value. I would recommend Land Teck for irrigation work. TomS",1
We had the Dixie breakfast meatloaf and it was fantastic! Plus the service was friendly and fast!,1
"Coming here every Wednesday after my child's swim lessons has become a tradition. So glad I found this place. I always order the coco puff, my husband gets the muscle up and my sister gets the Gigi with a smoothie. So delicious! They offer organic, vegan and paleo products as well :)",1
"Words hardly express how pleased I am with the entire process behind getting this beautiful, green artificial lawn from these guys. Every step of the way was perfect! Frank showed on time for the design work. He listened to what I wanted and immediately was aligned with my vision. My yard was dirt, weeds and dead grass. It had a river rock barrier with weeds growing through it. Delivery of the materials took a few days. The crew moved the river rock back, put down concrete curbing, prepped the ground, put down the weed barrier and  grass. It took two days: one for the curbing to dry, and the next to finish. They came while I was at work. I just came home, and like Magic my yard was complete! No hidden costs. Just quality work and fast!We will enjoy this yard for many years. I couldn't be more happy with these results and the service. I hope your experience is the same. What are you waiting for? Call them now.",1
"I echo all the other reviews. Had a great and painless experience with AMC Auto with some maintenance on our old camping van. I feel that they only recommended what was needed, were honest in the pricing, and even honored the 15% Yelp discount when I mentioned it. Great local business!!",1
"This one is probably the best laundromat I've ever used. I've lived in 3 cities where using laundromats were a necessity and just a way of life. Most of them are gross. Not this one. This one is clean, the staff is friendly, the machines work, and the change situation is easy to use. They actually have a restroom that is also clean, most laundromats don't have one. Even the patrons were nice, for the most part. It's in a strip mall about 3 or 4 miles from the strip. Great to use if you have an extended stay and prefer not to use the expensive hotel laundering service. I would definitely recommend this laundromat.",1
"Fantastic yummy burritos, enchiladas, they are vegan yet I promise you'll be back whether youre vegan or not",1
"Fantastic place!!! Mexican people is very positive, friendly and funny! Food is delicious and atmosphere is super romantic!!!Highly recommended!)",1
"I have been a loyal and long standing customers of Ruth's for at least two decades, namely the Richmond downtown location.  I live in Markham so for a Ruth's to open within a short drive of my residence is a big bonus.  I made reservations for the Markham location 2 weeks after it had officially opened.  The service was impeccable, we were fortunate to have a gentlemen by the name of Keith as our server.  He was knowledgeable, attentive and personal at a professional level.  As to the food, we ordered a chop house salad that was very disappointing especially at $20.00, soggy over dressed and small as to it's portion size.  We had also ordered their ribeye, large filet, and a side of fresh corn with red pepper and Jalapeño all of of which was cooked to order and absolutely delicious. We finish our evening with probably the best cappuccino I've had in a long time, along with the crepe brûlée and fresh berries, that did not disappoint.  All in all a very good evening where the only thing that surpassed our expectations was the attentiveness of Kieth our server.  I'd also like to compliment the manager(s) and supporting staff for a great dining experience.  I highly recommend the Markham Ruth's location, god bless you for opening in Markhan.  Finally a steak house of superb quality has landed in my beloved city.",1
"I would go back to this restaurant any day!! My partner and I got the veggie udon noodles and the sizzling sweet and sour chicken, and it was definitely sizzlin!! It was a great price and after a long walk down queen street west, a $4 Canadian beer was the perfect fit. The owner way very very friendly and appreciative of our presence!! Love love love",1
"Dr Rumuno is amazing! Clinic is great! Great service, no waiting for hours! Office is super friendly! Plus he's a teaching Dr! His interns are always great also!",1
"I have been going to Juut (Mood Swings) for 8+ years continuously. I have been seeing Skylar for several years for my waxing and facial needs. She is always bubbly, sweet, and genuine. I consider her a good friend. I had Julez cut my hair 2 weeks ago and she is absolutely amazing with short hair cuts! She is so fun! Then yesterday I had Landis transform my whole appearance. I went in with salt and pepper black hair and with a huge help from Becca I walked out a confident platinum blonde!!! It's my dream look and they helped me accomplish it and made me look amazing! I love the new Juut!",1
"This was the most unexpected, amazing dinner I've ever had in Vegas. When told that we were going to a sushi place for our last dinner in Vegas, I was not expecting much.  Lo and behold it was dinner and an interactive show. The food was delicious and upscale. The edamame had a real kick. I love spicy food so it was one of my favorite appetizers. Everything tasted fresh fresh, and the presentation was exquisite. This place also reminded me how much fun sake bombs could be. Definitely plan to be there for a couple of hours because you might just be there for food, but you'll end up staying for the entertainment. The staff was very friendly and they allowed you to participate in the show. SO MUCH FUN!!! PROPS to the DJ!!",1
Food and service is amazing. Only piece of advice is to make reservations because this place gets packed especially for brunch hours.,1
This review is coming from someone who was very stressed out. Life-changing experience for my father and I had to take care of him. I called Motel 6 and Nancy answers the phone. I tell her my situation and she immediately jumped into action. Ask what our needs are ask if he's over 65 etc. She got him in with the great rate right then and there. I cannot tell you the amount of burden and stress she and her customer service level helped me release. I appreciate her so much. Nancy's customer service is top notch. I have always been about amazing customer service and this lady delivered it.  THANK YOU NANCY,1
"Loved, loved, loved this place. Have been to the one in Tribecca in NYC. This one was equally as fabulous. I'm a sucker for a nice atmosphere and a great cocktail. Win, win here! Highly recommend. The sushi was delicious.",1
The chicken and avocado sandwich is to die for! And my bartender suggested a fantastic craft beer that I wouldn't have gotten in Atlanta. This place is worth the stop!,1
Dr. Davis and his staff are absolutely wonderful! Very friendly and super helpful. I would not take my dog anywhere else but here!,1
"I love mocha cappuccino frozen (blended) with a little whip on top. I get it everywhere I go. Starbucks' Frappuccino USED to be my best bet for a consistently great mocha but after sampling this place I have to say that I've had to change my mind. The service was excellent! These ladies really have it right and they always have a smile for me when I come in. They even had me try some samples last time I came through. I love the personal service and I really love the best blended Mocha Cappuccino that I've ever had. It isn't too sweet and it isn't too ""coffee"". They drizzle Ghiradelli's real chocolate all over it. It is perfect. Watch out Starbucks!  These ladies have got you beat on service, price and taste! Oh and they ""speak Starbucks"" so you can order what you would normally order at Starbucks and they'll make it for you no questions asked.",1
"By far my favorite place in Arizona to get green chili burritos, enchilada style.  I have no idea what they put in their green chili but it is delicious.  I cook a lot myself and haven't been able to crack the recipe yet so I've been coming here for years to get my fix and I love it. The red chili is good too but it's a little too hot for my taste. Honestly in my opinion I love this place so much I have had fantasies about getting a part time gig there just to figure out what they put in that chili.   My oldest daughter will threaten her siblings for my leftovers from lunch it is that good, lol.  Now for all the crap talkers, the majority of the menu is really good but when you order something as simple as a taco or a quesadilla it's no wonder you are not blown away.  Anyone can cook a chuck roast until the meat falls apart and fry it in a corn tortilla.  Try something that takes some time and effort to cook to gauge a recipe and then see what you think.  This is a family run business that has got it going on.  I love you Norteno's I hope your open until long after I die.",1
"I had Dr Villares do two surgery now, He is so caring my Blepharoplasty is so amazing, so many people have asked for his number!  so natural!  I would recommend to anyone!",1
We have tried other cleaning services before but we will stick with Rhino. Friendly and courteous staff and they get the job done. We are very happy. Thank you!!,1
We had a BLAST on the tour! Eric our guide was very enthusiastic and made the tour fun. The segways worked great as well.,1
"Son and I go here 2-3 times a month, always friendly, clean, and nice relaxing place to go, they have board games to play along with a tv usually playing a good family movie or kid tv program, very enjoyable with changing flavors all month long, staff great.",1
"Great, friendly place to stay! The rooms are spacious and nicely presented, the staff is very attentive and friendly, and the 44th street bistro in the lobby, fantastic food and service. All around a great place to stay whether passing through or staying a few nights.",1
I've been to Bonfire One time since its been open but not for the food! I went on a Friday night when the club is open! I had a blast dancing And drinking! Lots of people there dancing and having a good time! So BonFire is not only a restaurant it's a club on the weekends! My cousin tabby goes there a lot to the weekend club and she loves it! So I suggest to anyone looking for a Good time hit up Bonfire! You will not regret it!,1
"Took my C63 AMG to get some cosmetic work done and Chris was happy to do the work and told me to drop off the car in the morning and he'd call me in the morning. Chris is a man of his word and continually sent pictures of the progress throughout the day and finally let me know it was ready to pick up. The best part was Chris had quoted me a price, and when it came time to pay it was actually CHEAPER than what he originally said. Great shop and great owner!",1
"Wonderful restaurant, very original. As the name suggests lots of game meats, alongside some fish options. Every dish was delicious. Rabbit ravioli, bison steak, and curried venison meat patty were the real standouts.Excellent friendly and detailed service. Very original cocktails (including one with duck egg!) and nice selection of wine and beer. Dessert also very good, in particular the cruller donut.",1
"I am so happy that I moved here!  I always wanted to live in a high rise and I believe I made the best decision out of all available inventory by choosing Soho Lofts. Here's all the things I love:1. Loft style units--very spacious layout. 2. The neighborhood. If you're apprehensive of living downtown, don't be!  The area around the loft is a community. I converse with wonderful, friendly people from all walks of life everyday while walking the dog. They have enriched my life!  It's much more fulfilling than my suburban neighborhood was. It's also conveniently located to freeways and tons of food choices. 3.  The view, of course. Downtown is definitely the best way to face. You get views of wedding chapels down below, parades, the memorizing city hall building, and the sunrise!  4.  The staff. I love all the guys at the front desk. They are incredibly nice and attentive. It's great to have those smiling faces greet you after a long day at work. 5.  The rooftop pool!  Not many high rise residences have a pool on the roof. It's never been crowded when I visit it. I frequently have it all to myself. 6.  The neighbors. It's really quiet considering the location. Everyone is really welcoming and neighborly. I'm writing this laying in a hammock on my balcony and I just felt the urge to share my happiness!",1
"Melanie at the deli us such an asset to this store.  She is upbeat and extremely knowledgeable about the product.  I told her what I was making for dinner, hoagies, and she built the menu for me.  She even recommended a few meats that were a little more in cost but were better quality.  It is good to know that superb customer service still exists.  Thanks Melanie!",1
"Great golf academy. I've gone there 3 or 4 times now and I've worked with Vic Wilk. The guy knows his stuff and (probably the most important thing in a swing coach) knows how to easily communicate what his students need to do. As far as the facility, it's fantastic. Always in pristine condition. Great video equipment and great overall practice facility. I've been around twice when Mr.Harmon was there, what a stand up guy! Always says hello to me when we see each other and we've even joked around about each others cars. I'll be continuous customer!",1
"One of the best places ever have eaten there for years and they are nice. So dont listen to the bad reviews, the place is always busy need I say more.",1
"Our first time there  . . . . The food was awesome! Loved the fresh bread with butter cinnamon and ENJOYED the delicious, tender rib eye. I'd recommend to go there!",1
"The lady at behind the bakery section in the morning seem very nice. As for the rest of the workers, seems like it'll kill them to say ""good morning"" But the prices for the baked goods, can't beat them.",1
"I moved to town & needed a rental fast. The SMART team was helpful in fast tracking my ability to receive the keys. I have loved the property. Beautifully maintained & in a very nice, quiet neighborhood. I will hate to move when I finally find the right home to buy.",1
"Good food, cold beer, great staff!  This bar has changed hands several times over the last few years.  Best it has been!",1
This place is amazing! All of the staff are super informative and helpful!! I'm a local and surprised my mom with a ride when she came into town to visit me. She was nervous in the beginning but as soon as we got there all the staff made you feel so comfortable and right at home. It was really neat getting to be there for the entire set up and breakdown of the hot air balloons. Three go out at a time. You have to be there at 5:30am which is extremely early but sooooo worth it. Shelton our pilot was one of the nicest people I've met in town. Not one bad thing to say. He taught me things I didn't even know about my own city. Smooth take off and landing. I highly recommend you request him as your guide. There a champagne toast at the end of your ride as well. I will def be back again. I will definitely be back again.,1
"I dig this joint. It has good food for a reasonable price. My friends I always come here after a night of dancing or walking the Las Vegas Strip late night since it's open 24/7 and the Fireplace is absolutely nice and cozy. My favorites here are the Nachos & the Sampler. ""I always decide on those and I never go wrong with them!"" I recently had the wings here. They're a little salty, but not too much as to where you can't enjoy them so it's safe to say that I'd still recommend them. The cocktails are good here too. My favorite cocktail is the Scorpion here.",1
"Brunch. I was blown away by my entree. The Fried Chicken Benedict was not only a unique take on Egg's Benedict, but the flavor profile was multi-faceted. The Benedict was a large serving of food. It came in a deep bowl with a solo, large cheddar biscuit as the base. On top of this was a pineapple and papaya marmalade topped with four to five pieces of tender fried chicken. Two poached eggs and a small salad topped the dish. The sweet notes of the marmalade perfectly balanced out the more savory and spiced notes of the biscuit and the chicken's breading. There were also two specials that were not on the menu. There was a five-egg omelette and a Bananas Foster French Toast which sounded amazing. For starters we got the $6 sticky bun. The order came with two large sticky buns which were enough for 2-4 people. While the menu was small, they definitely do it well. I will happily be back.",1
Amanda and Joel are amazing! Really really helpful. Thanks SO MUCH! :) located my rare item and were so pleasant.,1
Very nice staff!  The doctor took her time with me and explained why I was having blurred vision... come to find out... I have no tears... LOL  =),1
"Amazing food and excellent service! Went there with a party of 4, was immediately seated, the waitress was amazing! She was even able to suggest different popular dishes and she gave us free cheesecake for dessert. The fillet mignon was to die for, the pasta dishes were equally as amazing and that carmel cheesecake was not a disappointment!. They also have a very unique bar that just adds to their decor.",1
I'm a sushi nut ! I've had it for lunch and dinner before while living in the NY&NJ area. I don't normally stray from my regular sushi haunts but decided to give this place a try this evening. It is only bout 1/4 mile from my home and I've passed it by probably 100 times. I got there at 5.40pm and the place was busy. The sushi bar was quick and the wait staff were on their toes as far as service. The portions of fish were incredibly large. I'm not sure I've seen portions and a selection of rolls etc like this before. Forget the Ra Sushi's and even Kona Grill where service isn't really what it used to be. Go with the Mom&Pop local places. Very well done! This coming from a sushi nut and someone who's been in the restaurant business for over 20 years.,1
Liz Awesome as alwaysAlways making sure your satisfied Making you feel at home Never rushes her work She know what she doing Making sure your enjoy your time at the barbershopWhy go anywhere else When you know you got True professional looking after your needs,1
"Incredible!  I had a repair done in January and only now posting, but the work was so good, I had to. I had a 50 year old pair of cuff links fixed. No other jeweler could do the job.  The price was VERY reasonable.  The joy of having these finally fixed is priceless.  I'm glad to give 5 stars.",1
"Just had total knee replacement surgery at Mountains Edge.  As an RN myself I was so impressed w all the staff and their knowledge and professionalism.  The food is very good! PT and OT departments are very encouraging! I recommend this new Ortho hospital. Dr McGee and Tom Welch,CRNA are fabulous",1
"I love this place!! They are always smiling and happy to see you and the sushi is fresh, made out in the front area so you can see it all happen! They have a great menu and I enjoy going there!",1
"Janae did an amazing job with my color, cut, and style! She's a perfectionist which I love. My hair has always been troublesome, but she tamed my curls and got me beachy waves. She didn't rush me in and out of her chair either. It looks amazing! If you need your hair done, definitely come here!",1
"Have been staying at the hotel for a few weeks and visit this place regularly. The food is amazing and if you get a chance to hang at the bar ask for Mike, he will definitely take care of you!!",1
"First Friday is one of the main reasons I recently moved downtown.  I love the crowd, the live music, the street vendors and of course the art.I saw a band called The Heathers, while it was all covers they actually gave me chills.",1
Wonderful place. Gelato is delicious. The lady who served us was so kind and offered lots of samples. I would recommend this to everyone. I look forward to coming back,1
"Best price, best quality...I enjoy coming here every time. Their dragon rolls are huge and packed with stuff and they def don't skimp out. It's a tiny place in North York so seating is limited. Only cash or debit.",1
"I'd never been here before, even though I live literally 2 blocks away.   It's so good to find a hang out in the hood that isn't a sports bar; while there's nothing wrong with Portuguese sports bars in general, I find this part of town intimidating if you are someone who feels out of place in one.  Hence a place like Naco is so thrilling - it's laid back, has a lot of room, and a newly licensed patio. My friend and I shared the Monday-Tuesday evening special - veggie nachos and two beer bottles for $15, and were quite satisfied.  The nachos had thick warm chips, mushrooms, salsa, sour cream, black beans, and of course a nice jack cheese.  We also each had a specialty cocktail - I had the Catalpa Kiss, which was mango juice, lime, tequila, soda, and salt.  It was quite refreshing, strong enough, and reasonably priced at $6.50.  Her tequila squirt (though oddly named) looked delicious, too.  Tequila, lime, grapefruit, and soda.  They only serve food here until 7 (except for the nachos, somehow) but I really liked the atmosphere, the server/bartender, and the patio.  There's a ton of room inside too for when the whether turns bad.  I'll definitely make this a regular place.  I can't wait to try the brunch and coffee.",1
Brunch is amazing. Huge wait though because it's a small cute bistro but worth it. Put your name down on the yelp wait list and you won't be disappointed.,1
The best place to get Mexican food in Phoenix! Their green corn tamale rice and beans are a must try along with an ice cold modelo. Their chips and salsa keep you coming back for more. Really anything on their menu is amazing,1
"I recommend this company to friends and family.I've had service 4 times from Hung-Rite on my rental property in Scottsdale and my primary home. Both occasions, the rep showed up on time and the work was satisfied with the work.They've fixed the noises, the transmitter and sensors, plus I've ordered a new door and opener from them and their pricing was competitive and the work was done on time with no hassles.",1
"I came here with some friends on a whim & was pleasantly surprised! The menu is small but everything is made from scratch. I got the huevos rancheros, my husband got the breakfast burrito, & my friend got the veggie burrito. All items were delicious & the owner made sure to stop by & tell us about all of the salsa ingredients & meats that they smoke in house. This place is also BYOB friendly which is a huge plus since it's right next to the liquor store! The horchata was refreshing & not too sweet & the guacamole was extremely fresh. The couple who runs this place is thorough & truly cares about the quality of their food. I have no complaints & will definitely be back!",1
"Ma Poule Mouillee for the win!  I eagerly anticipated their grilled/rotisserie chicken and was in food bliss when I arrived.  For $15 I ordered the sampler platter of chorizo, chicken, and pork; it also came with fries and salad.  The meats were awesome!  The piri piri sauce they slopped on top with a paint brush was oh so tasty.  The fries and salad were also very good, in face the fries are some of the best I've ever had. Undoubtedly one of the best values in Montreal!  Go now!",1
"Did Tao, and Lavo and then Mon Ami Gabi this week. Mon Ami Gabi blew the others away.  The service especially from Carlos And Georgina are out of this world.   The merlot sauce is out of this world.  The only place I always visit when I got to Vegas. Tried to Mousse for the first time... Wow.",1
"This is the best Lebanese food in town! Everything is phenomenal! The lentil soup is divine--perfectly creamy and yellow. The homemade pita is delicious and fluffy and hot. The meat is cooked perfectly and service is excellent. I had the vegetarian plate with dolmas and falafel and I was so stuffed, I had to take it home. This is definitely a good choice for a healthy lunch option.",1
"At last someone who understands the tequila drinker!  This was our second time at this new and excellent Charlotte area eatery.  We were pleasantly surprised during our first visit but just like the second shot is the important shot in golf, so too the second visit to a new restaurant is the telling tale to an amateur food critic like yours truly.  As a tequila afficianado, I was excited to see two full pages of agave nectar in the  well-organized drink menu. Some a bit pricey but I'm not doing shots so I get it.  They also have a nice list of local brews for beer fans and a variety of specialty margaritas and other concoctions for experimentation.The food is excellent.  Whether you're a carnivore or stick to veg like me, there are tasty items in the menu for all palates.  We love the Sol Trio of queso, guac, and your choice of a handful of salsas. We really like the house salsa which is chunky and beautiful on the generous portion of crispy tortillas. We also love the street corn, lightly charred on the cob seasoned well, and rolled in cotija and queso fresco. I have had the wild mushroom quesadilla and veg tacos.  Both excellent.  I recommend regular visits and we wish Rich great success with this new venture!   Vamos ahora!",1
"Andrew from Blue Zone was awesome. His communication was prompt, courteous and professional. The work was more than he anticipated, but he did an AMAZING job. Highly recommend and will be sending him more business.",1
"Since I work in the area a lot,  iv eaten at ALL the food spots for lunch. This is A much needed yummy lunch spot. Love their pepperoni pizza!Not sure what else to say, but yelp says I need more words.  Interesting...So yes it's a 5 star lunch spot for me.",1
"I'm going out on a limb on this one.  But, out of all the malls that we have in Vegas, this is my favorite one. In fact, I would say that this is one of the best ""mall"" I have ever been to in my entire life.Many of you have been to a mall at some point in your life. What I hated most about going to the mall was the fact that everything is overpriced. LVPO-S is basically the same setup as a classic mall, but everything is discounted.  Another great thing about this place is that it has all the good brand name stuff that we go to at a mall for (clothing, jewelry, shoes, and food), and it does not have the ""filler stores"" (you know what i'm talking about, Shoe Palace, Cellairis, Fanzz etc.)This time I went to the Skechers store to find some work shoes. Being an outlet store, these stores are somewhat bigger and carry a larger selection than their regular retail outlets. They had the size and model that I wanted that the retail store didn't carry, and they were about 33% cheaper, possibly more. I was satisfied.A lot of people complain about going to outlet stores because it's not as ""new"" as the ones in their retail stores. Hey, it's your money and you can buy whatever you see fit for yourself. But for me, I'm not going to be hanging out with Paris Hilton on the weekends or rubbing elbows with the Bieber Fever. Besides, anything you buy new at a regular mall will be ""out of style"" within a few months. I usually shop on Amazon and ebay now, but if I needed to shop for something, and if my computer and cell phone were down, I would go here. Without a doubt. :D",1
"I normally stay at the Venetian but my family & I stayed at Vdara for Halloween weekend & I never want to stay anywhere else in Vegas.  For a family this is great, all of the rooms are suites so you have a kitchen area, living room and bedroom.  We had the cheapest suite and that still had mini fridge that helped us w/groceries over the weekend.It's a nonsmoking hotel & there's no casino so if you're going to be busy doing other things while in Vegas, stay here!  You're just walking distance from the Aria, Cosmo and the Bellagio but if you want to get across the street, where there's a ton of things to do, you'll need to walk a ways to a crosswalk.Most complaints are pretty true, parking and the check-in/check-out.  Parking is valet only at Vdara so you may have to wait a bit during peak hours but the parking is free, you'll just need to tip the valet.  We were lucky that the check-in didn't take too long but since we had two rooms, I was only able to check-out of one of our rooms directly from our room's TV.  Not sure if this is a regular thing but when we were checking-out, there was a woman standing there that would take our info, our room # and took my email address so that they guestfolio could be mailed to me.  If there seems to be an employee hovering around the check-out line see if that's what they're doing so you can get out quicker!",1
"So now my son is now 10 and brought in another pair of broken glasses! They did a good job, did it quickly and for a fair price. This place is great and I'm glad it exists. I would recommend!",1
"Was so impressed by this restaurant, and will come back frequently! Staff was friendly and helped me decide my meal ( I couldn't decide because everything looked amazing) and her recommendations disappoint! You can tell they take great pride in their food and business. Authentic food, and amazing atmosphere. Planning to go back again soon!",1
"Got the boneless wings with three of them medium and the rest Chef's special (combination of garlic parmesan with ranch and medium sauce) and they were delicious. I think I slightly preferred the chef's special to the plain medium. It was a bit pricey at $8.36 (with tax) for 7 wings, but they have $0.65 wing Tuesdays. I'll definitely be going back for that :)",1
"I haven't been going to the particular shop for a longtime, I mainly use one guy here that actually came from another shop. The shop it's self is really chill and laid back, good environment, great staff. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone. Those first timers that are still iffy and nervous...these guys will make you feel comfortable and I promise they won't let you leave until your satisfaction is fulfilled!",1
"The food is amazing , I loved the misir wat, lentils with spices and Berbere... plus this was a great price for all the food. Me and my boyfriend split a plate of the 4 pick your own vegetarian option. I love that they have injera and that it is owned by some very nice people! The woman was so kind. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their dishes. It's a small place and feels really homey. I can't believe it took me so long to finally try this place !",1
"Me and my wife went for the breakfast buffet. They have good variety and the food quality is good for the price. There are other buffets in Las Vegas that are better but for the price of the Golden Nugget, I  was actually pleasantly surprised.",1
"I love T-Bird! The service from Erica the blonde bartender and Lisa the waitress is always great! They always make you feel right at home. I've never had Lisa make a mistake on my order and the food and drink prices are very competitive. They both deserve a raise. I wish they had a better happy hour, or maybe I don't, I don't need to be spending more time here lol. Love the T-Bird!",1
"This review has a surprise ending (in the best possible way).  The best experience I've ever had with a mechanic.  First, I want to make a special point of how friendly everyone was.  Polite, professional, and kind at every step.  The problem was diagnosed quickly.  It was explained in plain English.  I authorized the repair and it was completed within hours.  Now here's the kicker: the bill was less than I was quoted.  I have never seen or heard or this happening.  I was quoted a particular amount and expected to pay that amount.  I didn't see that it was substantially less until I went to pay.  I am blown away by this incredible act of honesty (they said it simply cost them less to repair than they expected, and they passed the savings along to me instead of pocketing it).  So in short, go to Martin's if you want extremely honest, highly competent service performed in a timely way, and if you want to be treated with the highest levels of respect and customer service.",1
"We came here before watching Mariah Carey and had a truly wonderful experience. We had a fairly big group (9 people) but we didn't have to wait at all (we had a reservation) and our service was impeccable throughout the entire dinner.  The food was fantastic as well! I got the filet mignon and nibbled on the truffle spaghetti. The truffle spaghetti was soooo good. I loooooved the flavor and wish I had got that myself. I also nibbled on the sea bass and that was perfectly cooked and really good. The majority of my group got the special of the night, which was a spicy tomato sauce pasta with lobster and seafood. Everyone said it was delicious and practically were licking their plates. We also ordered the seafood platter as an appetizer and another appetizer I can't recall. For dessert we had the apple cobbler and salted caramel soufflé and both were great. My only complaint is that I ordered the filet medium and it practically came out alive that's how rare it was. For $60 a steak I was expecting it to be perfect so I had them cook it longer and when they sent it back it it came back still a little less than medium rare, which I just can't eat. So I sent it back again hoping third times the charm. This time it came back medium but by the time it came back everyone in my group had already finished their food. I'm a slow eater so I felt a little anxious and tried to eat as fast as possible. However, they comped my meal, that's how amazing the service was! And when the steak was cooked medium it was really good. Not as good as Mastro's but still good. This is a great restaurant if you'd like something a little upscale while in Vegas. It's perfect to eat here if you are watching a show at Caesars. The food and service can't be beat!",1
"This place is right off the I-10 and it can get extremely busy! Surprisingly, the line moves quickly. The food is fresh and delicious. The Double-Double is my favorite item. I recommend you add grilled onions to your burger.",1
"We got a 3 nights free stay here. At first I was like ""...mom...red ROCK??? are you serious?!?! ive never even heard of this place in my life -_- can we stay at the cosmos?"" but when I arrived I was surprised at how nice the casino layout was and there was GREAT AIR circulation going on, smelled like I was on the beach LOL..no i just like it when casinos have great air circulation, its important to me. Check in was very fast, and when we got our room..lets just say I didnt want to leave it. And I've stayed in Bellagios Penthouse Suite and other suites (complimentary stays though) this place is reallly nice. Theres also a bowling alley, movie theater, and an arcade, so if you have kids they will have something to do.",1
I have been to this restaurant on a few occasions and have never been disappointed. The service is friendly and the food is fantastic. One of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the valley.,1
"My sales consultant, Greg  Bradshaw, made the experience so much easier. He explains features he knows you would use. He can tell when you're not into a product and will not push that one onto you. He's honest and friendly.  It was like buying from a long time friend. He wasn't pushy and he stayed till the sale was complete. He called the day after to see how everything was going. I am so satisfied with my purchase.",1
"As I sit here writing this review, I'm watching reruns of ""Say Yes to the Dress"" and in awe of all the beautiful gowns I see these brides-to-be trying on. However, I feel that none even come close to my gown and I have only one thought- that it's more than just the store or the sales team. It's everything in its entirety. Without one, do you really have it all? Ladies of Lineage is this bridal boutique for me. They not only have the dresses, and some beautiful dresses might I add, but the staff is impeccable. Natasha was there the day of my appointment to assist me and my family in choosing 'the one.' When I arrived at LoL, I'd already been to one other boutique and tried on at least twenty dresses, none of which I really liked, much less loved. So to say I was nervous was an understatement. But upon meeting Natasha I was instantly calmed. She listened to what I wanted, asked questions about my style as well as the wedding. She was superb at staying within my budget and not bringing any dresses outside of it. But it was the one gown, a Sassi Holford, that I instantly knew, would be MY dress. She spoke of pairing it with a belt, which I instantly shrugged off the idea of liking, and as soon as I saw what she had in mind- I knew she was the best of the best. I'd decided to go with the dress and belt #1, but then Natasha asked me to bear with her while she toyed with the idea of another belt- one that had glitz and glamour. I just knew I'd dislike it, because I'd specifically told her no rhinestones/gemstones/sparkles/sequins. And this belt was just that. Full of sparkly goodness. She placed the belt around my waist and when I looked in the mirror I immediately begin to tear up, as this was my wedding dress, belt and all. It was classically simple, which I recall having told Natasha over and over again. I couldn't imagine having gone anywhere else- nor did I receive near the caliber of customer service that I did there. I highly recommend these ladies as it takes more than just a dress, it takes a staff that cares enough about you and your idea of how your wedding will look.",1
"We have always had a great time here. Food is delicious. $5 sake bombs in Friday nights at least, not sure if they do that any other time. One of the servers, younger guy, is hilarious. We definitely need to go here more often!",1
Still serving delicious Indian food at a good price. Try the combo lunch platter for a taste of many great selections.,1
"Delicious and soulful vegan food with lots of variety! I go here when I am in the area with my vegan friend and I love their pastries or we might head over to Green next door. The hot wing breakfast burrito is fantastic! I got theae lemon poppyseed donuts that werd delectible! Really great vibe, the staff is fast and friendly.  The place can be a bit pricey for my taste however its pretty comparable to other places like this that i have been This place is always popping especially on weekday mornings. If you are looking for a sweet vegan spot in the area you have to check it out!",1
Always a pleasure to come see John and his wonderful staff greet us with a smile and know what we want to order and drink! Thanks Los Dos staff you guys ROCK!!,1
Love this place food is always fresh and staff is super friendly. Margaritas are really the best around the East valley. Tuesday tacos are the best,1
This was my first time here and I was so impressed. I wanted a Brazilian blow out done and Vedrana did an amazing job.  I have very very curly hair and she was able to make it behave. She listens to you and tells you step by step what she's doing. She doesn't make you feel rushed and takes her time to do it right. Thank you so much and I'll be back to have her do my color correction.,1
This place has some of the best tasting coffee I've ever had anywhere. Period. They serve LavAzza and the latte's here are to die for!,1
"I have someone special in my life that love the shape of the hexagon, so this was a store of joy to shop for gifts! I spent an hour here after lunch at the Hexx kitchen and bar and end up with amazing finds! Even if not for that reason it's still a very nice shop for sweets and souvenirs!",1
"As fresh as it gets!!  I had the farm salad full of chunky awesomeness and followed it up with the Ahi Poke.   Throw in a couple of ice cold beers, and that makes for an amazing dinner.   Love this place....",1
"I went to the Fort Mill S.C location, just because its very close by to the school I work at.  It was my first time eating here and I was surprised at the amount of people waiting to get a seat (but it was lunchtime, so understandable).  It was a nice themed place, clean and very friendly, the down south kind friendly.  Me being from California find anyone who calls me 'sweetheart' or 'honey' very endearing :)Anyway, we were seated and immediately were served a huge pile of hushpuppies with honey butter.  It was so awesome, I just kept popping 'em in my mouth.  The other 2 teachers I was with were regulars, so they skipped the hush p's.........more for me!  I ordered the salt and peppered catfish fillets with onion rings.  And it came out fairly fast while still being fresh out of the fryer.  It also came with coleslaw, which was very unappetizing.  I enjoyed my food very much and actually felt like my pant button was about to pop out.  But I only ate about 25% off my plate!  Very huge portions, very good food and very good service.  I took home the rest and my 2 sisters had a meal out of it :DI would go here any day and recommend it to all!",1
"Visited this location for lunch and the food was really good. I am not a regular pizza eater, but I enjoy the fresh and hot thin crust pizza served here and choices of fresh toppings. Ashley our server was excellent and my compliments to Ivy who puts a lot of love into the salads she makes. It would be nice if the manager would visit with the customers rather than sitting in the back. Then customers could share their stories about why they like this location. Just saying.",1
"Best breakfast ever! They serve things I have never even heard of like some flip donut with cream cheese. I had a huge bagel and some delish donut and my mouth hit the floor when I paid. I literally thought she only swipped the cream cheese, I did not believe her when my order was under $2.00!! If you have never been there you need to go- ASAP! Thank you checker #201 you made my day! I have never had such a great bagel!!",1
"This is by far the best Chinese place in Chandler. It's super cheap and you get tons of food, and the noodles are fantastic (and also hand pulled). I have always ordered the seafood hand-pull noodle plate with handpull noodles. Take out or eat in, this is a great option for anyone who needs to eat fast (they normally operate very quickly).",1
"Iesha was amazing!!! She knew what I needed done better than I could have put into words. Amazing color/cut skills. Great experience all and all and couldn't be happier with the result. The salon is adorable, and staff are very friendly. Plan to go back for all future needs",1
"All around 5 stars. From the filled stocked buffet, to the never ending meats, to the excellent service, I can't get enough of this place! Upon entering, the cocktail we were given was AMAZING. It was the perfect combination of sour and sweet. It was so strong but went down so easily. I had three because I loved them so much! I loved the idea of the buffet. It had EVERYTHING you could ever think of: fruit salad, potato salad, prosciutto & salami, everything!!! I was seriously shocked with the diverse selection. The constant service was impeccable. I tried to give each meat a try (except the lamb!) and boy I was impressed. I prefer my steak medium/ medium well and each server really picked the perfect slice for me. I love the whole idea of the meat carving. It was my first time in a steakhouse like this and it was just crazy how much you got to eat! The dessert was very impressive to me. I wasn't expecting anything crazy but the strawberry cheesecake was out of this world! The strawberry syrup on top was a perfect touch. These  I will DEFINITELY be back to Fogo de Chão. I am obsessed!!!!",1
Love their food and drinks! The staff is very friendly and patient.. everything is always super fresh! I definitely would recommend anyone to go!,1
Drove by today after I got off work. Place looked really nice on the outside. A very nice gentlemen by the name Andrew helped us out.  He made us feel welcomed. We Ordered a pizza and the wait time was very reasonable. It was a pizza that Andrew suggested to us since it was our first time there and the pizza was amazing. Very delicious food and the service was great. Trust me people you won't regret it. I'll definitely be back again.,1
"Owner is super friendly (and I think from Greece?) and food is great.  Tried the pizza and calzones, both were superb.  Friend tried the Monkey bread and said it was very tasty. Definitely going back!",1
Are you kidding me a cat lovers dream only thing I wished is I could have snuggled with them but of course there's the prospect of getting mauled lol. Beautiful place very small but it's just enough eye candy . Dolphin habitat is really nice & you can see them underwater as well.,1
I went in the other day to get a lemonade and some cheese on a stick and I was met with great service even better than the mall!! The guy who was working his name was Anthony he was working by himself but he was amazing he brought me a sample of their chili(amazing!!) and he convinced me to buy one of their combo 2s the new mozzarella cheese is amazing and I'll definitely be coming back to this location!!,1
"Scratch was only open for 2 weeks when I wrote my review, so I wanted to update since I have been here many times since then. This is becoming one of my favorite places in the city. Great atmosphere, a pinball machine, reasonable prices and GREAT food. The owner, Don, is usually there and is extremely welcoming and hospitable. I forgot on two different occasions to check in with my Open Table reservation before our meal, and he very kindly took care of it both times to make sure I got my points for the reservation. I've had a few different servers and they have all been wonderful! Rich took great care of us during brunch and was so friendly and personable. Noel was our server on multiple occasions, including a huge party of 11 for dinner, and we were all SO impressed with her service!Their cocktails are great. My favorite so far was a warm Jasmine drink that had a dried Jasmine flower that slowly bloomed as it steeped. Now, the food....OH THE FOOD. This place is great to go with a group because they offer a lot of small plate options that are great for sharing. I've had the poutine with mushroom gravy, arrancini, tacos, chicken & biscuit, brisket hash and more...and everything has been amazing. I'm constantly impressed with the menu and the quality of the food. Check it out!",1
"Came just to check out Meijers & see what's different than Walmart or Target, prices are just as competitive as the other 2. Now here's where it's different the customer service from each & every employee I've interacted with was top notch, everyone employee greeted us with a smile even if they were busy with other customers.    We never thought we'd buy anything but we sure did come out with a cart full of stuff we found cheaper. Shopping at Meijers was an experience that really converted us from  shopping the other 2 to them, we would drive the extra miles to have a great shopping experience.  The other 2 you barely can get someone to help you out & if you do it seems like you're a bother to them. Keep up the great customer service.",1
"One of The Best Burgers I've Ever Had! We are talking Next to a Burgers Priest Burger! My Dear friend Jessie told me to go to P&L Burger and I trust him! So I did! I got the Deluxe Burger, took a bite and Was in Heaven! P&L Burger just hit my #2 Spot for Best Burger Places in Toronto! It is located On Queen and Spadina close to a Burgers Priest! LoLoL I will definitely come back to P & L Burger!",1
"Well....  Again, very satisfied.  Love, love, love the way Grizz looks today too.  We asked for a different cut and again got just what we asked for.  Love this place!  We are new regulars for sure!!!",1
"Harvest at Bellagio was a surprise find for us!  We used yelp to narrow down our choices for our last night in Vegas, and Harvest came out on top!  It did not disappoint. Excellent steak and sides and the sommelier assisted us with an excellent wine selection. All food is organic and sustainably grown/farmed. Truly delicious!",1
My favorite Italian place for pizza and garlic cheese bread. Prices not bad for real real homemade food.,1
"Pricey but clearly worth the cost.  Best pizza I've ever eatten. So good you won't care the cost.  Family owned & the owner is often on premises.  Explains how they started and how they import their ingredients.  THIS IS SOME GOOD PIZZA, YOU BETTER COME GET YOU SOME OF THIS PIZZA!!!!   the pasta dishes are just as good",1
"I love this place! They did such an amazing job on my Kogi bear. Our dog is a Pomeranian mix. We don't exactly know his other half, but we believe he might be part Schipperke. At any rate, our doggo is a fluffy one. It's been really hard for us to keep up with his hair and I keep forgetting to brush him everyday so, unfortunately we thought cutting his hair would be more beneficial. Also considering he has black hair so walking him during the afternoon would be better if he had shorter hair? So we went in, dropped him off, told them our request. When we came back to pick him up.. Oh my goodness, he looked so adorable. We love his new cut and we'll definitely keep coming back. We also have another pupper and her name is Khaleesi. Once she's done with her booster shots and the vaccines she needs for grooming, we're definitely taking her here as well.",1
"fire!!! great customer service, food made to perfection! bummed I didn't get our servers name but she was just a doll!",1
"It is the best local bar/restaurant.  The burgers are great, for the same price as McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Burger King, it is far superior and far fresher.  The wings are tasty and they have so many flavors it rivals Bdubs.  My favorite things though are the cheese curds, those can be a meal on their own.  They are cheesy crispy delicious morsels.  I know I know, what's the difference between cheese curds and mozzarella sticks?  The taste, the cheese in the cheese curds are a sharper tasting cheese.  I can't forget the $3 dollar large glass of PBR, I think it's a 36 oz., it's one of those really large beer mugs.  So to recap for $10 I can have a burger, a shot, and a beer.  Makes this gal very happy!  The servers and bartenders are super friendly, makes you feel like a friend and feel like you're in the midwest.  The service in the kitchen can kinda be inconsistent depending on how busy they are, but even when my food comes out a little different it still tastes sooo good, so I don't even mind.Great place to sit chill watch sports and meet nice people.",1
"Setting:  Spent the day with the neighbors and found this gem while walking around the area.Ambiance:  Great view of the Sonoran desert while sitting on the patio.  The inside is very relaxing with comfortable seating and a surprising bar.  We ended up staying for a couple hours losing track of time with only ordering drinks.  The mood and feel is somewhere you want to shut your mind off for a while.  I would highly recommend for hanging with friends, flying solo, or even getting work done.Food/Menu:  We only ordered drinks on tap while the ladies had smoothies.  Everything was great with no complaints.Service:  Excellent service with no complaints!Overall:  Small businesses thrive on repeat customers.  Whenever we are in the area, we will be sure to stop by and relax for a couple hours.",1
"I've been here a few times and our must have items are the beef cheek pierogis and the 6am special. I hope they are never removed from the menu.I'm not a fan of scallops and even after trying them here, I am still not a fan. It may sound like a weird appetizer, but the pig's ears are quite good so don't be afraid to give it a try when it's available.",1
"Excellent service, confort, food and drinks variety. A great way to wait for your flight after working hard in Vegas, or after your vacation. The buffet selection is really good and hot dishes are really warm, dessert selection always change and the bartenders are really nice. I love spending some time there before a long flight back to Miami.",1
Found some great flooring at a great price. Not the first time I've been here either. Slade has great customer service and knows how lead a team!  James checked in with us several times to make sure we are being taken care of. I'll be back!,1
"The owner of this location, Kristel, is an awesome barber, stylist, artist, and even a better person if and when you get to know her. I met her four years ago through coworkers because I I saw their hair and asked ""Who did that?!"" and since then, she's done nothing but GREAT WORK on my hair. Even when I changed my style up a few times over the years, she would listen to what I wanted, verify with me during the cut that it was looking good at the time. She takes her time and to make sure I got EXACTLY what I asked for. EVERYTIME! She's very friendly and wants to know her clientele. It's great when she asks about my friends and family like we've been friends forever. That's just how personable she is. She has got the same skills and MORE as some of the veteran barbers around that I've had the pleasure of getting cut from over the last 20 years. Her spot is always clean, organized and comfortable. She's remodeled herself and made it feel homey. It's in an office space setting with plenty of public parking in the lot. Because I've moved to California, whenever I'm in Vegas for a few days, I will hit her up a few weeks before to schedule an appointment just because it's worth the trip here to hang out with good company. Thanks for always making me feel and look good when I get out of that chair, Kris. Keep up the great work.",1
"I had a great work-out yesterday at Damask! As a starter, I would recommend Damask to anyone who is looking for a yoga-pilates studio to start your yoga routine. Price and packages are very affordable. I'm gonna get my package when I come to my next class this Sunday. Will bring my sister and friend here with me.A big thump up!",1
Holy Moly. This is one of the busiest Starbucks locations that I've been to. But they handle it well. A bit of a wait. What else can I say but it is a Starbucks,1
"OMG! Everything was so good. The fresh fish. How it was the made. The buzzing endless motion of waiters. The helpful insight of our fish specialist (who took our order, helped us pick out which fish suits our liking). The Lokomedes was heaven! Excellent coffee. We had: the sardines, beet salad, broiled snapper, broiled Branzino, mojoitos, Lokomedes, another greek dessert that I can't remember. Paid about $500!  But worth every dime. Best memorable meal yet!",1
"Adore this place and go EVERY time I'm in Vegas. Amazing variety on the menu and always keeps me on point with my macros.Plus, guaranteed fitness star sightings with every visit.",1
"Stopped here on Sunday after finding out a local crepe joint was closed on a Sunday.  Didn't make sense but looking up reviews drew me to this place!  You can tell they're good because of the huge crowds here!They do breakfast right!  They're a bigger ""corporation"" with many locations in different states and yet still retain the quirky nuances of a family owned business.  Sweet!It was the first time I've finished my stack of pancakes anywhere.  Usually I take a few bites of the pancakes because they're never spectacular anywhere; just average at best.  Here, they were crispy, fluffy, lightly sweet...  I want some more now!",1
"I have only eaten there once and had the hottest meal, but, I still enjoyed it.  Indian and Thai food is where I go when I really want spicy.  I will definitely be back in the future.",1
"I really love this place. I have been going here ever since I was a little kid. The pizza is very unique as it is crumbled pepperoni or sausage on small cuts of pizza. It is very tasty and always very fresh. Most people either hate it or love it. I surely love it. I could eat at this place at least once a week. I've also gotten the Crusader Hoagie here which is a toasted Italian sub cut into 4 pieces and serves on a plate with a generous proportion of chips on the side. They do have a nice dining room area with a few televisions. You can also order for pickup, however they do not deliver. I can assure you this pizza is unlike any you have had before. It is very good and the employees are very friendly and on top of things. Great place!!!!",1
"I recommend this place to all Steaks lovers. This is probably one of the top3 steak restaurants in Miami. The service is excellent, they know the menu and give good recommendations depending on what you want. I never regret going there. The prices are a little bit high but def worth it",1
"I enjoyed my stay here soooo much!I had a fabulous room.  Although Bruce Willis staring at me over the top of a gun, while getting ready in the bathroom was a little intimadating.  The room was spacious and in good repair.  They crowning glory however  was the view.  We had a view of the Bellagio fountains. It was so magnificent.  However, my friends were in the south tower, with a room halfway renovated, they had a small tv( we had a plasma) and still had the alladin carpet with a view of nothing.  Ask for a renovated room, and try to stay in the north tower, you will not be sorryThe casino was tons of fun.  We gambled a lot.  I didnt win anything but my friend won $1000.  You can pull a daily slot for a chance to win $2million, I won tickets to Stomp, and the boy one a flashlight!",1
Great local Madison spot for food and drinks. The cheese curds are amazing! It can get pretty crowded around lunch and dinner time so you should expect to wait a little bit for a table,1
"For 3 years I was a subscriber to ""chronic cardio"" as my form of exercise.  I signed up for race after race to stay motivated and completed my first full marathon a year ago.  During that period I dodged knee problems here and there, and after the marathon the injuries seemed to stick around longer than ever.  That's when I knew I had to change things up, and a friend recommended Crossfit West Valley.  The workouts are always challenging, but are scaled to accommodate varying skill levels.  The staff is very helpful and thorough with instruction and advice when it comes to diet and other recommendations when it comes to getting the best results.  Within the first month I was in better shape than when I was at the height of my distance running, and 6 months later I am still improving.  I'd recommend this gym to anyone looking for a unique and challenging way to get in shape.",1
"Very professional clean looking environment. Nice bathroom/waiting room. Free WiFi and snacks. The estimated time was right on schedule and everything went seamlessly. My only complaint would come from the lady who was managing the desk. She was not very friendly or informative, but only seemed to be working there a short while, therefore I will still leave 5 stars because it would be unfair to the owner of such a pleasant business to rate it off of a new higher.",1
"I've tried many cookies, this one has got to be the best cookie ever. Big, chewy and right amount of crisp and yet soft to melt in your mouth. I usually need to dunk them in milk or coffee but not this bad boy. Went right to my mouth! I'll be back. Also, they just won an award at a cookie competition for the best cookie. For the record they should be called Le Ermahgerd Le Good. Nom nom nom!!!!",1
"The best Mexican food I've had I get the chicken burrito (chicken wrapped in pita, sauce, cheese sour cream on top, with the rice, fried beans and salad on the side. Very yummy when I'm in the mood for something real over Burrito Boyz/Fat Bastard. It's simple, family owned, and price is very fair for generous serving size and great quality. I think I've been going back almost every other week.Not a fancy restaurant but an honest place for good food.",1
"Holy shit this is good stuff.It's not ""normal"" pizza - each pizza is very small, has a thin crust, and you'll need to get a separate pizza for each person.  It's not a gorge-yourself-on-cheese-and-greasy-meat kind of meal.  It's pizza to be tasted, savored, and thoroughly enjoyed.  It's pizza for pretentious people, and that's okay.  In fact, it's better than okay, it's the best pizza in town.",1
"Today I had a spa pedicure by Vivian and SNS by Gee. they both did an amazing job! They took their time to make my nails look beautiful. The Marlene at the front desk was attentive, professional and polite. I will be coming back and recommending them to everyone I know. This is my 3rd time here and the customer service has been awesome each time and they deserve an appreciative review. Thank-you!",1
"I'd highly recommend cool sculpting here.  I found the staff to be professional, kind, and friendly and helped to guide me thru the process.   Very discrete and conscientious with the treatments I received.  Updated media systems with access to various streaming options to keep you entertained while getting a treatment.",1
"I really enjoyed this show! It's part comedy, part burlesque, and part acrobatics.The comedy is super vulgar and raunchy, so don't come here if you don't like swearing and super sexual jokes. I know everybody in our party thought the comedy was hilarious, and we all enjoyed the acrobatics. I also thought the music they played throughout was great, and I am currently on the hunt to figure out what songs were played. The show is not actually in Caesar's Palace, it is in a circus tent outside of it. The venue is very small and intimate, so it really doesn't matter where you are seated, pretty much everybody has the same view. I would advise against sitting in the front row, as the people there were picked on quite a bit.My only complaint would be the seating sucks. They are hard folding chairs, it's very cramped, and not too comfortable. I did see some couches in the back row, if I came again, I would try to get one of those. My back was starting to hurt during the show and since it was so tight, it was difficult to readjust the way I was sitting.",1
Awesome first visit. Must return again with the family. God sauce is where it's at for good flavor on the Jessie Rae.,1
Great staff and really delicious homestyle Mexican food. It's been around forever and I know why.,1
"I was approached by management & given a free suite on NYE people. Uh mazing. I had to get one night out of the 3 but the price was so discounted it is hardly worth mentioning. I got VIP status for check in & everything was wonderful. The suite wasn't one of the posh remodeled suites I saw advertised but it was clean & nice. There was a VIP lounge that had complimentary food/beverages & we just couldn't seem to be on property at the appropriate time but it sounded bueno & wish I had a made a point to be. The suite had it's own separate entries for each room & were completely independent. We were on the 16th floor & had great views. The Westgate has started putting their mark on the old Hilton & LVH property. It's changed a lot in the last 3 months since my last review & issues. Seriously much better. One, they ditched the awful Cantina that my heart wanted to love because it had Motley Crue memorabilia & Vince Neil owned it. BTW that hole has moved to Circus Circus. So funny! In it's place was a private concierge lounge which looked gorgeous buy sadly my VIP card didn't get me in. Number 2, where the Hi Roller slots once hibernated a 24 hr café called Sid's opened. The food was pretty good especially at 2 a.m. & busy busy. Get the Elvis shake. It was delish. Last but not least they also have opened up a bar at the base of the stairs in the front entrance. Can't miss it. It's modern & gorgeous. The staff is helpful & sweet. It opened the night we arrived NYE. Just in time for the party goers. It quickly became our go to before & after returning from the strip. It's also 24 hours. The gambling machines in the bar hadn't been installed or maybe approved by gaming yet but they are coming. This place is in a great location off the strip but off the monorail so you want to party hard on the strip & return to some solace this is going to be your place. Can't wait to see what other changes are coming. Should be GREAT. Keep it up Westgate.",1
"This place is delicious. The Orange chicken is awesome, not all breaded up. Order it spicy, it's perfect. Also, get the boiled wontons trust me. And the size versus the price is great. $10 should fill you up easy during lunch. I drive from Happy Valley Rd to go eat here.",1
"Ive never seen a Starbucks in a place that looks like a giant dining room in a house ... Def quaint and cozy, staff is very nice... And. I believe it's attached to a hotel...",1
"My new favorite bar. The decor is welcoming. The staff is fantastic. And who doesn't love a bar that serves spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. Looking forward to trying more of the menu, but the spaghetti rocked.",1
"This is by far the best buffet in vegas or should i say in the world. Food is fresh, tasty and lots of options.Very creative menu. i think they have perfected the dishes. Service is great as well. Will be back again.",1
I've always been a fan. Great atmosphere with friendly people at the counter. Brunch is especially good here. The coffee smell is amazing!Beautiful outdoor patio that is dog friendly.,1
First time at this location and I'm pleased. Very clean and staff was polite and professional. Rico was my massage therapist and I felt he was extremely knowledgeable.,1
"The food was amazing, loved it! I am usually pretty weary of raw fish, but their sashimi completely changed my mind. They even gave us a complimentary yellowtail sashimi, which is their signature dish. Everything we had was top notch and pretty reasonably priced. Definitely recommended!!",1
"Teamania was an incredible experience with the family, would return the strawberry Arizona was recommended by one of the employees and we were definitely not disappointed.",1
"Had a Groupon for the $22 blow-out and went in on Sunday & had a fabulous experience. As soon as I walked in I was greeted warmly and immediately offered a beverage.  The salon is well decorated and very clean.  They had ""Some Like It Hot"" playing on the TV which was great to watch while getting my blow-out; one of my fave movies.  My stylist Megan was great and very friendly.  Everyone in this place always had a smile on.  My hair felt 10lbs lighter afterwards and it was so soft!  I will definitely be back and am considering becoming a member.  So happy I found this place!",1
Rom the moment you walk in to looking at prices Barbra was amazing she was sweet and treated us like family then after all our approvals she sent us with David Gunther (gunny) even though he is a bears fan he was amazing with the contracts he kept conversation going easing our worries I will definitely refer people to Barbra and gunny they are Kia's best asset they know customer service,1
"Asada tacos are really good, the salsa are delicious, not to mention the cooked onion.really good food.",1
"We ate here twice while in Phoenix on a 3 day work trip from Texas. (Lunch and dinner). Both occasions, the food and service were great. I had the Top Sirloin and baked potato on visit #1. On visit #2, I had the Walt's Champagne Chicken Salad. It was amazing. Their pizzas looked delicious as well. I highly recommend visiting this location!",1
One of the best pho place ever!!! Definitely will keep coming. Only thing is you have to wait every time during the lunch or diner time.,1
Visited Noble Beast Brewing last weekend and I found my new favorite bar/restaurant in Cleveland! Impressive beer selection and food menu! We intended to stop by for drinks and an appetizer prior to nearby dinner reservations. Yadda yadda yadda... Their dessert was pretty great too! Will be back soon!,1
We stopped in for the first time mid morning and was delighted to be greeted so friendly by the host and server!  Lovely coffee bar we will come back to frequently!  The food was perfect!  We can't believe we waited so long to try and this location is unique from other IHOP's we have tried!,1
"Super polite service, always greeted with a smile :D tanning is nice and efficient, clean facilities and every tan comes with a free dumb dumb and GOGGLES ARE PROVIDED! Was given free prework out to test out different products that will work with my body right and was given great advice in choosing correct protein. I go here legit everyday!",1
"I visited the Stone House at Quivey's Grove this past Saturday with my parents and some family friends from Chicago. The place is so cool, the service was excellent and the ambiance is just overall really great. We enjoyed sharing some appetizers and I had one of the trout dishes and a salad. Everyone enjoyed their food and the portions were pretty big. Sometimes fish can be overlooked but mine was perfect. I didn't even try the muffins they bring out because I was so stuffed. The only thing we didn't love were the old fashioneds and the trout dip we had didn't seem to have much trout in it.Overall awesome experience, prices were fair, and it's just a beautiful place. I look forward to coming back sometime in the future.",1
"Bright, clean space!  The servings are generous and their oyster ceviche is served with shrimp and fish with a tangy green salsa -- was delicious and affordable.  Papa Lai had a shrimp dish and he scarfed it down barely giving me a chance to try it.",1
"So good! Flavor is amazing We ordered the lamb skewers, fish, green beans, eggplant, and crispy pork intestines.",1
It was amazing the best service you will ever find and the best food a man can eat pizza was huge and the best ive ever had made vegas worth wild,1
"Knucklehead at work pulled out of his parking space, turned too soon and crushed the front of my Tesla. Fortunately none of the aluminum was damaged, but all the composite parts in front of the bumper were torn and needed to be replaced, including the automatic cooling louvers. The car is a Signature model and the nosecone is no longer in production, but luckily it appeared salvageable. Exoticar is the only approved Tesla body shop in Las Vegas.Thankfully, the other guy's insurance took care of the cost of the repair (and it wasn't cheap). The staff at Exoticar was very friendly and attentive, and Kenny was responsive whenever I had a question. They even had a driver take me home after I dropped the car off. Parts availability from Tesla slowed things down a bit as the front fascia is no longer current production and I was trying hard to preserve the original appearance. Happily the repair is phenomenal, the paint matching of the new parts is flawless. The interior of the car was very clean and the exterior appeared freshly washed. You cannot tell that the car was ever damaged. In stark contrast to the negative reviews here, I have nothing bad to say about the experience whatsoever and at least based on my personal experience here would have no hesitation about using them again (although I hope I don't have to)!",1
"We have been here a couple of times before a show at the Benelux Center. The pizza is always a winner!  I recently tried the brisket mac and cheese. I now have a new favorite meal. Be sure to go early if you are there before a show, because you might not get to enjoy your meal before running to the theater.",1
"Very enjoyable anniversary dinner.  We were given private booth at the front of the restaurant, with panoramic view of the valley.  My wife and I had swordfish and short rib, both of which were excellent.  Service was attentive but not rushed at all. Jade Bar next door was also a fun spot.  Would happily recommend elements for a special occasion.",1
Been coming here for years and they still do an amazing job. My mom and my boyfriend even come here as well and love it just as much. Thank you all!,1
This review is for my experience calling in to see if anyone could get out today. Unfortunately they were already booked out. But my experience with Katrina on the phone was great. After calling many places it was nice to have someone who was actually pleasant. She even double checked to see if anyone could get out. I would call to schedule something again just because of my experience on the phone today!,1
"One of the best spots up here. Nice employees,  the food is f-ing amazing.. great quiet spot to sip some wine any time . Love it",1
"This is a great venue for watching sporting events and concerts. Located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, with a multitude of places to eat and drink. Parking is easy to find although depending on what is going on that particular night it can get a little pricey. We have paid $20 to park, usually $10-15.  They have new security rules so I avoid taking a purse in if possible. But it's not too bad if you have to bring one.  We have never waited more than a couple minutes to get in.",1
After a week of trying to port my phone Kyle  and Chaze were awesome!!! The phones I originally wanted were on back order so Kyle went above and beyond and searched the inventory for phones that would meet my needs!!! He and Chaze were both extremely patient. Both are excellent reprentations of the  Sprint brand! Thanks guys!,1
Jake from Gilbert Poolman came by and diagnosed both a heater problem and a spa light problem and fixed them both to my satisfaction. Prices were great!Now they keep our big pool clean and sparkling; which was almost impossible before.,1
BYOB! One of the best hidden gems in the burgh! An awesome Italian dinner - will be back often!,1
"Best kept secret in Vegas! Wonderful atmosphere (which is always my favorite). Maggie (4th day on the job) did wonderfully in service. Prompt and courteous staff. GREAT COFFEE AND FOOD!! It is worth the trip to dine and enjoy the quaint, but amazingly wonderful restaurant!",1
"Sensational Food, Spellbinding ViewThe Fountains Brunch at Jasmine may be the best Sunday brunch you've never heard of. In comparison to the more famous Sterling Brunch across the Strip at Bally's, many people aren't aware that on Sunday, Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe, Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit old lady, but never feels stuffy, especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet, the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains, which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons. Fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform. Outside of the fountains, the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not massive, but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here, with the usual Bellagio-classy twists: the belgian waffles are red velvet, the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an excellent raw bar, a selection of caviar and sushi, and awesome cold bites and cheeses.There's also an omelet station, but a better choice is the soup, where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef, lamb, and incredible carved slab bacon. The dim sum components are great too: sui mai, short ribs, crystal prawns. Best of all, they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. The finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts, and unlike many buffets, these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally, the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts, what was particularly good that day, and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. Downsides: it's not cheap ($80ish), and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines, and I believe the lowest was about $15?) I think they add gratuity automatically, but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. Overall, this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas. Make reservations, go hungry, and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself. If nothing else, this is probably the classiest way to deal with a hangover on the Strip.",1
Amazing food! Beautiful and clean location with a relaxing atmosphere.  I been coming here for the past 6 years and I've never had a bad experience with service or order. Definitely a must go place for Greek food,1
I was just in Phoenix for a couple of days and found this place!! The staff is so friendly. They explained how to throw the axes and stuck around to give us tips on how to hit the target. This place is clean and well kept. And would totally recommend this place for a night out on a date or with a big group of friends!,1
Jackie is amazing!!!! I've been coming to her for years! She is the best at what she does! She is professional and friendly! I will not go to anyone else to get my eyebrows done. I have very course thick hair and she always threads them to perfection! Thank you Jackie for always making me feel beautiful!,1
Great food! Excellent service! Linnea was so helpful with the menu and made sure our whole dining experience went well.,1
My husband and I both loved our experience here. Staff were very friendly and constantly ensuring we had everything. The BYOB was definitely a bonus. Our instructor was Jake and he was very good. There was another gentleman that was circulating between the two rooms to replenish supplies and ensuring everyone is doing okay. Both of them kept us engaged. And we had two lovely paintings to take home!! We highly recommend this place!,1
"I have only good things to say about this whole place all of the nurses and staff are awesome and I absolutely love Dr. Wilkes he is so amazing! He has the best bedside manner, he's so gentle and caring and I can honestly say I completely trust him 100% I know he has me and my babies best interest at heart. That can be so hard to find so that's something that means so much to me.",1
"I've been a ChocoSol customer for quite a few years now. I first discovered them at my local farmers' market, where they pedal-power a cart selling warm drinking chocolate that is dairy-free, some of their bars, coffee and even vegan cookies. They now have expanded into making fresh tortilla and grilling up one sweet and one savoury tortilla, both of which are vegetarian and the savoury can be made vegan through the omission of cheese. Over the years, they've really improved on the quality and presentation of their cacao products in my opinion. I come from a chocolate retailing background, as well as a cacao-growing ancestral history so I've been familiar with the pod to bean to bar process since I was a child. Last Friday, I got to check out their new factory space near Dufferin & Dupont. They're hosting weekly chocolate workshops leading up to Christmas. The 'chocolate-making workshop' title on my ethicalDeal voucher was a bit of a misnomer. We didn't actually make any chocolate, nor was it really a workshop. So, why the heck am I giving it 5 stars? It was a really great evening examining the chocolate-making process at ChocoSol, from beans to bar, and from farmer in Mexico to cold and grey Toronto. We also got to sample everything from their freshly Vitamixed warm drinking chocolate, which has vastly improved over the years, to their raw and roasted cacao and all the different flavours of bars.Everything they do at ChocoSol is done with sustainability in mind. They only receive one order of beans per year. They only have one winnowing machine, one conching machine. They do solar power roasting whenever the sun is out. All they get to all their markets, Dufferin Grove, Wychwood via bicycle. Really, you can not get more granola and they know it!All their cacao products are dairy-free (save the tortillas at the markets, but they don't sell those here) and they are expanding their line to include other sustainable local foods like organic hemp seeds. Their chocolates are also gluten-free, and nut-free to accomodate for just about every common food allergen. Their hemp seed bar was my absolute favourite, followed very closely by the coconut and the vanilla.If you're used to eating only chocolate confectionary aka candy bars, then you might not have the palate for this. It truly is a something you acquire, just like how McDonald's consumers don't tend to like vegetables, your tastebuds need to have the sensitivity to enjoy the richness of dark chocolate with minimal sugar content and zero artificial flavours. Most candy chocolates also contain hydrogenated oils, also know as transfats, and just about a zillion other additives, sometimes even food colour(always read labels, folks)! Yes, the crap from the grocery store, **nodding** even that Laura Secord and Godiva stuff at the mall has it. Why do you think this stuff can sit on a shelf for years on end and not expire? Anyway, you won't find any of that here. This tour has actually stole my top chocolate local, fair trade chocolate endorsement from Camino.ChocoSol, you've won over my chocolatey heart!I stocked up on great stocking stuffers like drinking chocolate pucks, wrapped bars, even Karmalicious cocoa butter bath bars, as well as a stack of unwrapped bars for myself. Keep with the sustainability theme, if you bring your own container, you get a discount on the unwrapped bars.They have holiday discount and gift packs promotion on for a limited time. Check it out: http://chocosol.posterous.com/theyre-here-chocosol-holiday-giftthrift-packs",1
"Our first meal in Vegas for the trip and we decided to indulge ourselves in some cocktails and classy entrees. HEXX kitchen + bar is located along The Strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains and indoor/outdoor seating. Talk about an ideal location! Alexxa's and Hexx share a front entrance. If you plan on dining and having an actual meal, you'd be in Hexx's domain. If you plan on imbibing in cocktails or munching on some tapas, you'd be in Alexxa's. The two places are under the same ownership.The roasted salmon with black quinoa, peas, and beansprouts and the braised branzino with tomato sauce and pea risotto were absolutely delicious! I'm glad no one was watching me eat, because I could not for the life of me figure out how to eat the beansprouts off the roasted salmon without looking like an animal (chopsticks, please?).Because we enjoyed the food so much, we came back the next day for brunch. Their Hexx Benedict and Carrot Cake Pancakes were melt-in-the-mouth delicious! The Hexx Benedict over scalloped potatoes was executed well. Perfectly poached eggs over a bed of buttery scalloped potatoes. The Carrot Cake Pancakes tasted as if they had come fresh off the griddle and the cream cheese frosting and syrup made me question whether or not I was eating brunch or dessert for breakfast. Of course, we paired it with a pitcher of sangria from Alexxa's. If you're not sure which sangria to get (and there are many to choose from), the sangria flight is a great option!Needless to say, we were very full and satisfied with our meal. Definitely a great restaurant to check out with a nice ambiance right in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.",1
"These are THE BEST BURGERS. I've been coming here for over 10 years. This was my go-to stop all through college at UA and beyond. Moving to Texas has caused serious withdrawal for swensons, even Texas beef can't compare to these Galley Boys! Perfectly crispy onion rings, good onion to breading ratio. Amazing fried shrooms. Milkshakes are the best I've had. So many flavors and all exceptional. These beef patties are cooked JUST right with a hint of sweetness on a toasty delicious bun...YUM!",1
"Nice, flavorful soft shell crab. Sautéed to perfection! Lemon caper sauce was tasty. Sauteed spinach side dish offered perfect accompaniment. Service at bar was speedy and steady throughout dinner. Always look forward to next visit!",1
"Breathtaking! I've been wanting to see this show for about 10yrs or so but never got around to it. Then, when planning a recent trip to Vegas, I finally decided it was time. Reading some of the negative reviews made me a bit nervous about going because the tickets aren't cheap and it'd been a long time coming to end up disappointed, but I ultimately decided that I just had to see for myself. SO GLAD I DID!! It's a wonderful balance of light and dark, circus and art, whimsy and drama. Fully worth the price of admission. I sat in orchestra level section 104, row G, seat 10 and felt that my view being close to the stage helped me to fully appreciate everything going on - because there is A LOT going on at once throughout the show. I did start to get a bit uncomfortable sitting in the seat, but not enough to cause a major issue. My husband also very much enjoyed it and he's never been to a theater, circus, or any other such show. Haha. And to the point that some say there is no story line: I disagree. I'd liken it to Alice in Wonderland or The Nutcracker. Lastly, I just want to say that I also enjoyed viewing the sculptures in the lobby. They're absolutely beautiful and worth taking looking at.",1
"Snooze is a brilliant execution of a post modern diner done with contemporary twist...or is it a contemporary diner with a post modern twist?  Anyways, like I said before Snooze is brilliant!  Great food (breakfast and salads only), great drinks, incredible staff that are on point and pièce de résistance: they have stevia LOL",1
"Johnny Mango's is my favorite place in Cleveland. It is only fitting to write an update, since my first review was almost 5 years ago after I had just moved here. Since then, I have come to love this place. EVERYONE is friendly. You can go by yourself (as I often do) and not feel out of place. The fellow diners are generally fun; rarely do you run into a-holes. There are so many reasons to love this place, I can't even count them. And I've had to take four freaking stats courses.It's more than the drinks and the food: 1) It's the chef realizing you've never tried the BBQ chicken and insisting that you share HIS dinner in order to finally try it. 2) It's watching baseball with Jimmy at the bar in July. 3) It's people of all shapes, sizes, colors, sexual preferences, political affiliations and economic standings sitting in one place and talking about the community. 4) It's picking up food to go, and ending up staying there for an hour due to the great conversations and company.5) It's definitely a place for carnivores, but has the best vegetarian/vegan food in the city. BY FAR.It's loud, but it's intimate, it's stylish but eclectic, it's got one small TV but manages to be a great sports bar. It's a great, great place on that funky little corner of Cleveland.",1
"Love this place!! Everything we've tried has been a hit. Our absolute favorite pizza is the Salsiccia. And please try the cheese platter, but ask for extra bread because you'll want to dip it in the pesto they serve with it. Or go ahead and dip your pizza crust in it if you don't just drink it.",1
"Excited to hear that a good friend chicken joint was opening up near home.The fried chicken is as good as it gets. Ordered a box of 10 pcs, pieces were pretty huge.A tad bit salty for my taste, but then again i prefer less salt in food.Tried the biscuit and the gravy, the gravy was pretty bland for my taste, could do with a little more seasoningAll in all, great fried chicken!!!",1
Amazing time a must do... You make your own great time.. Let loose and enjoy.. Ricardo is the man he was accommodating and really adjusted to the groups personality he made our trip an amazing time .. Request him ... Great for all levels you are free to ride as you like .   The fun range also was amazing.  Ricardo Rocks ..,1
"Love the place, lots of fun! Great food server.we had lots of fun!!! My friends daughter's bday was perfect, all you you are awsome from the drinks to the food, I like the idea of the video games does not need coins, and the diversity of them... I enjoy playing pacman with my friends , this 4 players game is the best!!! Will be back soon.....",1
The Real Deal!! not Hormal ...The only place in Arizona that reminds me of Detroit !!,1
"I can't believe I haven't left a review yet! This is an awesome, family owned and operated torta shop. I love the aquagate veggie torta. Their guacamole type green salsa is incredible. The frescas are on point....never too sweet and they always taste natural and fresh.",1
"We had a lovely evening at the Geordi's, the restaurant at the Wrigley Mansion. First, we toured the mansion, then had a wonderful dinner while a wonderful jazz group played. Our server, Mike, provided excellent care. The jazz group is top class yet the lounge was surprisingly empty! What a waste!! Will be back!!ashdbxgf",1
"Matt does good and clean work, everything is done with precision. His prices are very reasonable. He does vinyl wrap along with tint. The shop is inside of a car dealership, just go in and ask for Matt. Thanks again!!!",1
Great service and family friendly in sin city.  The food smells great the the staff is very friendly.  I don't care for county music but I'd come back,1
"What an amazing start to my weekend long trip to Toronto. I've been meaning to take my family out for a nice sit down dinner and I couldn't have picked a better place. We had an 8 pm reservation for 4, and were seated immediately, although one of my guests arrived around 30 minutes late. The setting was intimate, the decor was tasteful and the server was very pleasant! We started off with the tagliere formaggi valtellina (a plate with an assortment of DOP valtellina cheeses). The millefiori honey paired wonderfully. We shared the Dante Salad, and 3 different pasta dishes including the gnocchi al pomodoro (MY FAVORITE), the squash ravioli, and tagliatelle al ragu bianco. Every dish was impeccable. Stelvio has become my favorite restaurant in Toronto and I can't wait to go back! 5 stars!",1
"Fantastic mid century store!  Great prices too.  Get off the strip and get shopping on this street.  If you like antiques, retro and mod, you won't be disappointed.",1
"It's a GREAT day to shop when you can donate $5 to charity, get 25% 2 nice shirts, and get such fantastic service!  While I am not crazy about mall shopping, Macy's has yet to disappoint.  Bought 2 Calvin Klein shirts at about 1pm.  I wish their receipt had the guys name on it at the counter.  His service was 5 star all the way!",1
Brianna is the BEST!  We had a large group with kids. She was so patient and thorough. Soooooo kind.  And the food was EXACTLY how we ordered and AMAZING,1
"Hillstone is one of the best restaurants in town.  Fabulous people, excellent staff, and the food is always fresh and delicious.",1
"I first came to Olive and Ivy back in 2006. I have come back consistently several times every year, and it never fails to impress. Great service, cool vibe, superb food, and a beautiful setting. Such a good place to go and one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. Keep doing what you are doing and you will always have my custom! Thanks team.",1
"I saw this review on Yelp and I decided I wanted to give them a try. My leather sectional has been looking very worn and I have been researching several options. I called this place up last Monday, They gave me an estimate the same day with only pictures from my phone to go on. They picked up my sectional Tuesday and that Friday they called me up to say it was done and delivered it Monday. I am very happy with the results I would say it's a 95% improvement and almost looks brand new again. I have no idea how they matched and replaced a piece of torn leather perfect. Everyone I spoke to seemed very professional and they moved furniture for me so I'd have something to sit on while my sectional was being worked on.",1
"This is a MUST SEE!!  I had wanted to see this show a few years back when I was in Vegas before and I wasnt able to see it.  But WOW/  The seats are great, no bad seat in the house.  Love the mix of water, acrobatics, theatre and everything.  The stories told were great/  Love the costumes and the acrobatics are amazing.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see a spectacular show.",1
"I absolutely adore Blue Wasabi!! They have such a fun and creative Martini list. I have tried a bunch of them but my absolute favorites and I get them both every time include the bellinitini and the milky way. Giiiiiiiirl if you haven't had these martinis, you are missing out! Their food is amazing ad well. I love their get clucked sushi roll and the shrimp bizkit roll. I was a super big fan of the chicken and waffles sushi roll (a. I think it tastes great with a maple drizzle on top. And b. It is so ceeatuve. I have never seen that anywhere else). For non-sushi I normally share an order of edamame, drunken bbq shrimp (DIVINE!!), And the spicy mayo rock shrimp. Don't forget to save room for the chocolate rainbow roll at the end of the meal. I thought having dessert was kinda crazy and werid at a sushi joint. Which it is but it was also killer.",1
Our rooms were super clean and updated. Having a pull out bed is great for the kidsThe staff was personable. The ice machines were plentiful and conveniently located ( so important when you travel). Room service was tasty and a realy life saver. Having the restaurant and bar downstairs was a nice touch at the end of a long day!,1
"I've probably driven by this place over a dozen times but I ALWAYS seem to miss it. I was gazing at the plaza while at a stop light and saw ""Caribbean food""... ***Tire screech*** I decided to give it a try for lunch. They have $5 daily lunch specials (stew chicken, jerk chicken, curry chicken and fried chicken) & they come with a canned drink. The restaurant is under new management which I think is a great thing after reading older reviews! I was greeted with a smile and the lady behind the counter was helpful, they had all menu items in stock (if you go to Caribbean restaurants regularly like myself... You know what I'm talking about. When they ""run out"" of something they never replenish the item which is soooooo annoying to me) however that was not the case with this restaurant! Service is speedy gonzales fast! I was literally in and out in under 3 min.... Very impressive. The food??? Very good! Fresh, hot, flavourful and authentic. Try it out when you're in the area!",1
"Good coffee , comfortable home feel setting eggs over easy perfectly done, pancakes are just amazing!!! Fast friendly service from Jen w lots of refills of Coffee.",1
Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. I'm from Southern California which has great Mexican food and this place would be among the top of my list.They are family owned and always so easy to talk with. They remember my name and say hi every time I come in. This is the only Mexican restaurant I ever go to in Gilbert.,1
This was my first time at SumoMaya and was not familiar with their menu. I was greeted with free valet and was seated in a very comfortable corner table for 2. The waiter was not only delightful but knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We started the dinner with an order of Mexican street corn which came decorated with popcorn. It was slightly hot but in the most amazing way. Next ordered 2 al pastor tacos and 2 pescado tacos. Both selections were delicious and simply just fresh on each ingredient. For my drink I ordered the Tokyo mule which came with a lil kick in it as well and in an very enjoyable way. Finished with arroz marisco dish that the waiter brought out in an artistic looking pot. Mixed the fried egg with a large spoon and this combination of flavors made out to be the reason why I'll return. The scenery is beautiful but the food is the real winner here,1
"Stopped in and picked up a combo plate of gyro and sish-kabob with spicy hummus and yellow rice as the sides. Both meats were really tasty, especially the kabob which was also really tender. The spicy hummas was really good with just a slight bit of heat. The thing that blew me away though was the yellow rice. It was soo flavorful that I could have eaten that just by itself! My interaction with the staff was brief, but pleasant. Anytime in near there I will be stopping in. Oh, a few months ago I stopped in and got their house salad with gyro meat and that was really good too.",1
"BodyHeat Tanning is my go-to when I am in need of a perfect, glowing tan! The staff is always so welcoming, kind, and will always refer you to what is best for your skin! I have been a consistent customer of BodyHeat since 2015 and I have not once received a streaky, unwanted tan! The salons I have been in are all clean and make you feel welcomed. I highly recommend anyone to BodyHeat Salons to receive the hands down best tanning services!",1
"OMG. This is definitely a great AYCE that was needed in Brampton.Everything we ordered was nice and fresh. Service was on point. Friendly, efficient, and quick. I am definitely returning.",1
"I had heard that this was the best brunch in town!  Now I believe it!  Great selection of breakfast and lunch foods - mimosa, good seafood, and incredible desserts!  Great service!  We had a table right on the water and it was gorgeous!",1
Best ice cream in town!! The pistachio one is to die for.. nothing else to say than simply delicious. They have lots to chose from and theyre open until 12am if you have that late night craving :)),1
This was the easiest place to get taken care of no worries just amazing. Between the owner and the girls is a real sense of family! Great cut and time. Everything was perfect. Would recommend this place to everyone!,1
I was referred to Dr. Ryan Rehl by my ENT for Sinus Surgery and I'm glad he did. Dr. Rehl is the best! He was so thorough and explained what was wrong with me and and ensured I had surgery right away to fix my issue. The surgery was life changing and I couldn't be more grateful. From the moment I walk in the staff is so friendly and nice. I come here every few weeks for follow up and I'm greeted so nicely by all the staff every single time. The doctor is very sweet and knowledgeable and shows sincere concern for his patients. I recommend this doctor and office to everyone I talk to about my procedure.,1
"My mother, brother and I went here for diner today... the food was AMAZING. I ordered the guacamole and they came table side and made it in front of us. Soooo good! I also had the ceviche and carna Asada torta so yummy. Very authentic food.. left very pleased and full.. The customer service was perfect, I never had to ask or wait for a refill or anything. Alwayss came by to ask if we needed anything anytime they seen anything close to low! Very attentive . The atmosphere was relaxing and they had someone in there with live fun Hispanic music.. and singing not to loud but just enough to enjoy it.. I would definitely return. Had such a great experience. If you haven't tried it yet, please do. Definitely a diamond in a rough.",1
Thank you so much for being great you guys been a lot of help to her family members you guys always go out of your way to accommodate us and we thank you for that thank you to the team of Life Care for being such a great team,1
As a vegan I struggle to find options for food. But the vegan dog is great and tasty.   I will be back often to enjoy the different types of styles they have! Cute and quaint place in heart of old town.,1
A friend and I had a blast at the Sex Tips for Straight Women from a Gay Guy @Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. The attractive actors were charming and funny. They engaged several audience members into part of the cast and show by engaging them into hilarious skits. The audience roared as did my friend and I. This is a fun risqué show. I recommend it.,1
"Recently I was shopping for new light fixtures and stopped into Lamps Plus on Indian Bend.  The fixtures are great but what impressed me most was the outstanding service I got from Joanne.  She let me browse but was very helpful in offering ideas.  Most of my items weren't in-stock but with free shipping, it was even better because everything arrived at my doorstep!When it was time to do ceiling fans and switches, I returned.  Lamps Plus may not be the cheapest option but that's because what you get is a higher quality product and service!!  Again, Joanne was very helpful and respectful of my time.  (I stopped over lunch and had to run, but she emailed me some pictures and links.)  When my handyman had trouble doing the install, I called the store and Joanne quickly got me in touch with Lamps Plus' installation department and I was on the schedule in less than a week.The scheduling team (California-based) was very responsive and helpful with reminder calls.  The install technician, Cory was prompt and professional.  I had one issue with a faulty switch that had to be replaced the following weekend, but that's not a reflection on the store... that stuff sometimes happens!  A different install tech fixed my issues (sorry, I didn't get his name) and was just as prompt and courteous.Nice store but top-notch sales, installation and scheduling support.  I'm in the middle of a renovation project and working with many contractors and vendors that has been less-than-pleasant.  Lamps Plus has been terrific... if only all renovations were this easy!",1
"Sometimes you need to review a place and know exactly what it is. Is the fast food place and not a gourmet restaurant. In terms of fast food I find it really good and the options are exceptional as there are plenty of different things you can order. Food taste is going to be hit and miss for a lot of people but I do like it plus one of the big things for me, is you can get ice cream and any place that serves ice cream is a bonus in my book. When it comes to ice cream this place is one of the best in terms of fast food places.",1
"Yummy!!!!!!!!!! They are so nice, the food is so good! I love the tacos, shrimp burritos, and taco salad!!!! I still love you guys! The tacos are amazing along with everything else you made!",1
"This review applies to the US Passport Office at this location.  Thank you to the kind employee who took care of my mom's passport this morning.  The employee was extremely courteous and professional, going above and beyond.  My mom would not hesitate to return to this office for any passport needs.",1
Stopped on the way to Vegas. Very friendly wait staff. Service was quick and attentive. Excellent brisket and ribs. You can tell this is a regular stop for the locals because there was a lot of friendly exchanges between patrons and staff.,1
This place NEVER fails! Make sure to make a reservation if you don't mind waiting for the grill. Food and service is always amazing!,1
"Eat here twice on a recent visit to this great city. Once was for lunch, had a delicious salad with grilled chicken, field greens and fresh strawberries. Others at our table had a nice looking burger, a French dip sandwich and a different salad. Service was excellent and all the food was fresh, tasty and very nicely presented.  We went back for Sunday brunch which was also yummy.  My omelet was cooked perfectly and the asparagus was fresh and flavorful.  Again service was attentive without being hovering or smarmy. I really liked the eclectic decor and didn't think it was 'grandma -y' at all. I liked the vibe a lot and would happily return on our next visit to Madison.",1
"Excellent work...so pleased with our daughter's wedding.  Arne is a true artist.  He is BRILLIANT and his staff is professional.  They consistently communicated cost, design, and updates.He worked with us through photos and phone calls.  I cannot tell you how many of our guests asked us about our florist and flowers.  They truly were impressed.  I would recommend Blooms Plantscape for your wedding in Cleveland.  He turned the Old Courthouse into the wedding of a lifetime.  It was stunning!",1
"I had a great dinner tonight! Our waiter, Rob, was amazing and the chef was so nice! We started with calamari and garlic bread. Both were delicious. In addition to calamari, there are fried lemons and peppers in the bowl! The garlic bread has cheese on it and was super yummy. We had three pizzas. The Parma, Farm House and Mushroom. The mushroom pizza was from the bottom part of the menu (white sauce pizzas) and I really liked it. It had a strong garlic and truffle taste...very different and yummy. The Farm House was definitely different for me because it comes with egg on it. I didn't have a piece of egg (2 out of 4 slices have egg) but the other pieces were delicious and it's basically a breakfast pizza. The children's pizza was a really good size! We added pepperoni to it and it came with ice cream too! My friends ordered a pitcher of Sangria ($30) and really enjoyed it. The service was amazing and the food was delicious!",1
"This food is the freshest, best tasting I've ever had. Amazing hummus. Fresh dressings and lamb and chicken that water in your mouth. This place CRUSHES any Greek food in the area. It's not even close. The Ziki rice alone is amazing. As a extra benifit, the owners remember your name. They make you feel like your coming home every time you come back. Forget anything else and just try Ziki's. I promise you will have a new favorite place to eat.",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE The Palazzo. I stayed here from a Saturday-Tuesday and had an amazing time! MY boss took us to Las Vegas and since he is a high roller we were living in the laps of luxury for the weekend. When we arrived at the airport there was a driver and a limo waiting for us. Upon our arrival at the hotel we were stunned at how beautiful the lobby was. There were huge fake flowers that were so pretty (not tacky) that lit up the entire space. The lobby was hustling with many people (bachelorette parties, couples, and groups of friends/family.) Everyone seemed to be having a good time and it perked me up immediately.  It didn't think it could get any better until we headed to our rooms.....but it did!!When we put the key in the door and it opened our jaws dropped to the floor. The first thing I noticed was the great view of Treasure Island from my window. It was a huge room with 2 comfortable queen beds and a sitting area that was located a couple steps down from the beds. The bathroom was INCREDIBLE! There was a glass shower and a nice big tub, on the other side of this huge bathroom was a makeup table/vanity with a lighted mirror. Then there was a huge counter with double sinks but I was wondering where the toilet was. To my surprise, there was a water closet that was separate from the rest of the bathroom. This was great because if you are sharing space with friends and family they can get ready while you use the bathroom. Also, there was a TV in the there! The bathroom had double doors....DOUBLE DOORS!! The seating area had a pull out couch and a TV. The queen beds also had another TV which was awesome. 3 TV's in one room?? Not really necessary but AWESOME! There was also a lot of closet and drawer space if you need to stow your clothes and belongings. I would 100% stay there again...and again and again! If you want luxury, then stay at The Palazzo! It is a short walk from the busy part of the strip (Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and Caesar's and Bally's) but, its not a far walk.",1
Great beer selection. Great greasy foods. Milkshake was amazing. Outdoor seating. Volleyball court is nice.,1
"I do not have the traditional PHO meal when I come here. The lady and gentleman who run this place are extremely friendly and very attentive. The food is delicious, inexpensive and the atmosphere is very cozy and nice.I usually get a very non traditional pho meal, (grilled chicken, rice and salad). With two pieces of deliciously grilled chicken, steamed rice and a yummy house salad, you are only look at spending $9- INSANE.The veggie spring rolls are extremely yummy (large portion) very crispy. We have also had multiple hot plates (the beef and chicken hot plate is delicious and well seasoned- vegetables are steamed perfectly.)The only disappointment is their sweet chili thai sauce (it's very watery and doesn't do much as a sauce).This is a great choice for an inexpensive dinner option.",1
The staff here is very knowledgeable. I had a great experience and a sick new piece to brag about for months! They have a very large selection of quality glass that is hard to find here in AZ i love this place!!!,1
Michael was great at getting our estate planning in order. Everything went smooth and very timely. I have a great sense of comfort knowing all our papers are in order. If I need anything else in the future I will certainly use Michael Tucker again.,1
Great selection here! Everything we have gotten has been delicious-I especially love the little sandwiches by the cash register. Love having a place like this in town!,1
Lucy is so great.   Every time I come she makes me laugh and always gets me to try new things. I am so happy this place opened so close to my house.   Even my mom is now obsessed with this place.  Lucy just told me I missed her by like 30 min.,1
Primp and Blow is great! I've been getting weekly blow outs for over 3 years and I'm always happy. Talaya is great as well as mamagement!,1
Great place-affordable and delicious.  Highly recommend this place.  The watermelon salad was amazing as well as all the desserts.  My wife enjoyed the black bean burger.  All in all a great experience and wonderful service.  Thank,1
"If you are gluten free, you need to get here!! We split a capicola hoagie and a steak flatbread and fries and OMG, so tasty!!! And also too much food for two people :) The hoagie bun was tasty and not crumbly and the flatbread (made with pizza crust) was too. The fries were really good too - they tasted fresh and were kind of puffy. The eat-in atmosphere is not great (very small and basic) but honestly the food is so tasty you won't even care. And the employees were very nice and seemed very knowledgeable about gluten!",1
"Very Happy with Their Workplaces and Prices. Second Time I Have Hired Them! On Time Friendly, and Quality Workmanship.",1
Bring Cash! Extremely cheap ice cream but it's the very best in this region. We're not wasting our time at Dairy Queen any longer. They are open for most of the year but close  in the winter months. This is our new weekly tradition.,1
"Everything went smoothly from the start with a phone to the finish when the work was completed. All the details were handled courteously, professionally, and punctually. The work I had done was more complicated than it seemed but the technician kept at the task, figured out the wiring issue, and replaced the switch which solved my problem!I am very pleased with the service and repair that Simple Electric did for me. I would definitely use them in the future and highly recommend them.",1
"Caramel macaroons, all I can say is YES!!! BEST!!! hazelnut second runner up, now we just need a nutella or pistache!!! PLEASE!!!!!! and great fresh farm organinic ingredients in their daily lunches...I love getting their weekly emails sent so see what's new for the week:-)",1
I am so happy with my service with OG's. The service was great and also the VIP coordinator.. The limo driver was great too- contact Sophie @626-806-3916-she really help me with my needs for creating the most epic night!!! I will definetly go back!!!!! 5 star~!!!!!!,1
"Excellent breakfast with consistent 5 star service. I have had breakfast all over Scottsdale in traveling for work and the Steel cut oats here are awesome! Plus, they give you both walnuts and pecans, plus strawberries!Great job!",1
"Great place, always has helpful employees and consistently good food. The night crew does great!",1
"John and Marco just left my house. What a pleasure. They were on time, friendly, personable, and equipped with lots of muscles to get everything done quickly and efficiently. I would definitely use them again if I wasn't leaving the area.The price was reasonable and they took my debit card over the phone. I set up the appointment online and it went perfectly. Thanks guys, good job!",1
"Vive l'Express, Bravo au chef Ghislain Roy et sa salade de bettrave. Tout est bon.",1
"One of the top Montréal cuisine! Cozy ambiance, good service and delicious food! Lots of choices of seafood! Menu change often so always a good surprise. Highly recommended!",1
"One of my favourite coffee shops in the city with lovely atmosphere and neat items (for sale). It is relaxing in the summer and cozy in the winter. Service is excellent and all beverages are made with care. The espresso here is more of a medium roast with a hint of bitterness, great with a little bit of honey.",1
"My sister from California was needing a blow out and ""perking up"" today! It was 109 degrees and her hair was drooping and needed some ""TLC"". We were greeted warmly by the reception area. She was able to see Arbianna in a few minutes.I had an errand to run...and when I returned, Arbianna had waved her magic wand. My sister looked fabulous! She was radiant and her hair was the prettiest I have seen in years! I highly recommend Primp and Blow Waterfront! Arbianna was a magician and transformed my sister from a drowned rat to ready to take on the world!Great job Arbianna!",1
"Yet another fantastic eve at our new favorite neighborhood burger joint.  We came here last minute, got seated promptly on the patio, misters turned on per our request!  My only disappointment of that evening dinner was that the Impossible Burger was sold out!!! It was the only thing I was looking forward to...BUT...our server, Barby  was amazing!  She was so fun, sat at our table with us while we decided what to get, as the Impossible Burger was not an option...we love coming here!!!",1
"We had such a great time at the ""mini taste of pottery"" class. I took my mom to this class because we both have never had the chance to experience making our own pottery. Mish was so awesome with explaining the process of throwing a pot, and helped every person individually learn. I really appreciated how she went out of her way to make sure every student was understanding what to do. After we finished throwing the pot, we learned how to glazed. It was a quick process, and actually pretty easy to do! My mom had such a great time she is planning on coming back with friends soon. I can't wait to see my finished pieces. Also they have a really sweet sleepy little studio cat that lounges around and loves to be pet! Be sure to check out Desert Dragon when you want to learn a new craft!",1
"This was my first tattoo and I was extremely nervous! I took a chance and walked in not knowing anyone who had a tattoo done at West Coast Tattoo and I was pleasantly surprised with how comfortable ""Ace"" made me feel. He helped me pick the perfect font and took his time with me. His tattoo gun was very quiet and he stopped frequently to ensure I was okay. And the price was much less than i expected! The parlor was very clean too. He did an amazing job and I'm very happy with the results! I will for sure recommend Ace!!",1
"I visit hundreds of restaurants each year. I have family in the fine dining business. I am friends with one of the worlds greatest super chefs. These opening sentences give you a breath of my culinary enthusiasm.Eight Acre Kitchen is a magnificent restaurant! Every detail from the beautiful interior with perfect lighting to the cool hammered look flatware is well thought out.  I must add I was absolutely impressed with how everything blends together harmoniously. The menu is a collection of hearty and delicate dishes seemingly very well executed and served by the most wonderful staff imaginable. I enjoyed Polenta fries with an onion compote that was a brilliant blend of crisp yet fluffy polenta logs and the sweet and tangy onions with a cracked peppercorn like nothing you've ever tasted before. I ordered a pork shank from the special menu with mashed potatoes and a sautéed red cabbage. This dish was unbelievable perfection. The pork shank was tender yet firm and fell apart and melted in your mouth. To combine it with the sharp cabbage reminded me of actually eating in a country farm house. Yelp readers, do not miss an opportunity to visit this establishment. An absolute grand slam!!!",1
I got married 6/28/16 and Omg nisha (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was amazing! I showed her 2 pictures of what I wanted and she nailed it perfectly! She was very friendly and very punctual! I LOVED my hair for my wedding and got many compliments on the pics and my curls lasted ALL day! ( even in the rain) I was also afraid my tiara would come out and she assured me it would stay and It did! I was very happy with the service I received from the first call to getting my hair done.. So worth the money! Nisha if your reading this you were amazing and I appreciate and loved my hair! I felt like a princess,1
Best pizza on the strip. So rich and flavorful. The cheese breadsticks were amazing. We ate them before I could take a pic. Will return again!!!,1
"My wife and I stopped in after receiving a text for a discount.  We love yogurt, and were excited to give it a try.  I was very impressed with this location.  Very clean when you walk in, tons of yogurt flavors and the biggest toppings bar I've seen.  The prices were on par with other yogurt places we have been to.  The topping bar was full, fresh and clean....Impressive!  The young lady that checkout us out was very friendly, and we check out quickly.  We will definitely be back!",1
"2nd time I've used them. First to check out an RV I was buying and they saved me from being ripped off and now to work on my manifold. Make sure your ok with the service call and paying for the required 1 hr but before you make a decision you need to know these people don't take longer because they are hourly, are HONEST, and great at what they do. Tyler help us this time and John before that. Tyler showed up on time, was easy to deal with and pointed out some other issues for the future that might need repair. They actually repaired what another mechanic said they had repaired and for much less! If you're traveling, like me, they don't take advantage knowing they won't see you again. Thanks again!!",1
"So amazing to have an aquarium in the dessert! Some very unique concepts that make it stand out from other aquariums. The whole complex is developing to be a family destination center. Besides the aquarium there are dolphin encounters, butterflies to explore and a fun mirror maze. This is a great place to spend time with your family and out of town guests.",1
21$ all you can eat anything off the menu! It doesnt get better than that.  Best sushi ive had in vegas! Fish is very fresh and over 40 rolls to chose from,1
"E&G Real Estate Services managed our property in Phoenix Arizona for many years and handled the sale of that property for us as well. We have been nothing but pleased with their professionalism, sound advice and prompt attention to any need of our tenants or ourselves. They have excellent standards for advertising the property, finding a proper tenant, processing leasing agreements, inspections of property and being available for any need that arises. They have excellent resources for any repair or work needed.  They handled a quick successful sale of the property for us as well. They have been a pleasure to work with. They are a very professional company that I highly recommend.",1
"NOM NOM NOM! This place is great! I stick to the furikake chicken because it's just THAT good, but I've had a few other things that were tasty too. The furikake is just my go to here. I've never been let down by it. Aside from the perfectly crisp furikake covered chicken, is their holy grail... que the drum roll... the mac salad. -Insert moment of silence here- YES! it is that good! It's amazing! I can't even begin to explain. I could literally eat a tub of this with no regrets. The food is just really good, freshly made, and super yummy! The staff is always super nice, and speedy! I wish there was one closer to my house.. I'd probably ask them for a job and accept furikake chicken as payment. No joke. Getchu' some!",1
"Find some treasures and feel great about helping animals who need your help. Located conveniently between the West and East Valley on Cave Creek Road, Halo is a lovely thrift store run by warm and caring staff. It has a small boutique feel. Many items caught my eye. They were clean and well presented and felt like a vintage shop. I love it!",1
"The place is a cozy little restaurant that'll always smell like fried chicken so don't wear anything you don't want smelling like food. Their chicken rice is their signature and rightly so, I LOOOOVE the sauces that they drizzle over the dish to unite the sweet and salty sauces and fried chicken together.",1
"First time eating from here, I had food delivered from Postmates.  I got the Spicy Tuna rice bowl and all I can say is, I AM IN LOVE!!!  It was SOOO delicious and plenty of food, I couldn't finish it.  The Tempura eggplant was amazing, very flavorful.  For you fellow ginger lovers out there, their ginger was VERY good, white pickled ginger that is a tad sweeter than most places, but very good none the less.  Happy Customer, will be back!",1
"A great Mexican restaurant with delicious food and just a really fun vibe. It was really busy but service was fast and waiters were great!Fish, zucchini, and pork tacos were great but more than anything else the lamb tacos were absolutely incredible! Churro sundae was a great twist on a classic desert! P.s. Gotta love the free picco de gallo with the yelp check in!",1
"If you knew how many times I've walked by this restaurant and never gave it a second thought you'd laugh. So after reading lots of positive reviews i decided to give it a try...and I'm sold! I really enjoyed this corner spot restaurant pretty much contected to cote vertu metro.The owner greeted us upon walking in and gladly explained all the dishes to us one by one. The thing that I read in other yelpers comments was a complaint about the time. Personally it took about 5 minutes to receive our dish, and that's great because i know they had to actually COOK my meat and not just heat it up. They had THE BEST FRIES...an exact replica of McDonalds, and the portions of fries were huge. They also have this amazing dipping sauce for your fries that had me licking the container once it was finished.What did i eat? The IRON MAN sandwich, which was nicely spiced tandoori and Moroccan chicken smothered in cheese. This sandwhich is a definite try!Would i come back? Yes...and often!P.s. another great thig is that this place is Halal",1
"Was here about 5 pm - 7 pm on Fri/12 Jul, Sat/13 Jul and Sun/14 Jul:- My buddy and I had the   http://www.OnTheRocksLasVegas.com/ticket-information/  (3 Day Pass) wristband which included some free drinks per night at Social.- Friendly staff, sometimes service was slow when they got busy (maybe too many people getting free drinks that time frame)- Their $20 ""Social Misfit"" drink includes a 6-oz ""SOCIAL"" engraved drink flask that you get to keep.- Cheap bottle service such as $75 for 375-ml Grey Goose (or $65 for 375-ml Ketel One), plus a 20% service charge.- Since Social is centrally located in the Palms casino pit it's great for people watching.  - Social is my favorite casino bar overall.  (I also enjoy the Rio's casino bars since as a local with a players card I get 25% off drinks).",1
14.95 for AYCE lunch. Guaranteed to return. I love the banana roll.,1
"We came here after eating next door at the sushi place where the portions were small and we were expecting a sushi bar which it wasn't anyway.  Sage was an awesome cowrie nice.  Four course meal that just continued to impress as it went along.  You gotta be hungry though and at the end I was just too full to wanna party so I wouldn't do that again unless it's early in the day. Cost was $100 per person, which I thought was reason my priced actually considering its Vegas and all the food you get.",1
Been in town for 6 months and by far this was my best experience!! Suzie Q was our server and was outstanding! She was so informative about the menu and gave us great suggestions. Gave us a tour and was so gracias to help out with tickets for our stay. She defifinately went above and beyond to make our experience a great one!!! Great asset to your company!!,1
"Benny knows hair! He's worked miracles for me for over 5 years now! His blonde color is always just perfect! He knows how to read the lay of your hair to determine which cuts will and won't work for your hair texture. The salon has a nice ambiance that makes being there relaxing. Thanks for always being on point with my color and style, Benny! You're priceless!!!",1
"Really enjoyed our meal here. Used OpenTable to book and mentioned that we were celebrating an anniversary. They brought us 2 glasses of champagne! Apps included the french onion soup and a ceasar salad (both very good) and we both ordered the Pepper Steak, both were cooked perfectly, black peppercorn on top with sauce on the side. My twice baked potatoe was awesome, husband's fries tasty. We had a bottle of wine as well since it was a celebration. Service was friendly & attentive! The Miller Pie ice cream dessert was amazing. Only dessert we had the entire trip.",1
"The seafood at this restaurant literally had me speechless. What a beautiful dining room with a view of its own lagoon. The fine dining atmosphere can be romantic as well. The menu is a little intimidating with all the Italian names but ignore those and read the descriptions ;DThis restaurant is the ONLY restaurant in the ENTIRE North America that serves Langoustines. They were cooked so perfectly and had a texture that tasted like if crab and shrimp had a baby. So delicious and was the highlight of my dinner. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!A few other must have dishes:- Ricotta Ravioli (ravioli di ricotta con caciotta Toscana)- Grilled Octopus (polipo Ligure alla griglia)- Ricotta Butter that comes with bread for the table (Seriously, you have to try it, its so good)",1
"Came to check this place out, this is one out of the two places we have been able to find an affogato on the menu. My boyfriend ordered the affogato and I was able to try it, and it was delicious, they let you pick the flavor of the ice cream which was different from what we are use to. I ordered the chai, and it was absolutely perfect, like I have mentioned I enjoy my drinks on the sweater side of the spectrum and this chai tasted like Christmas morning to my taste buds! The place itself has plenty of seating space, definitely good for getting homework done.",1
"Came here last Saturday with a couple friends, before The Hip finale.Pints are $6 a glass, flight of 3 cost $9.Two of us opted for the flight.  Beers were great!  Unfortunately the Yuzu barrel was dry, so I'll definitely have to try it next time.  While enjoying our flight we also had an order of their home made potato chips ($5).  Nice and crunchy with a slight seasoning.  Great match for the beers.All 3 of us ordered the BBQ braised beef ($19).  It fell apart with a fork and was delicious.  The beef sat atop a bed of mac n cheese, which was creamy smooth and cheesy.  Also on the plate were some greens to balance out the plate.  Oh, and a home made cornbread muffin.Finished off with some peach cobbler served in a jam jar($7). Big slices of caramelized peaches with a crunchy crumble and fresh whipped cream.  It was devine!It's a small joint with only 4-5 tables and room for 5-6 at the bar.  They'll definitely need more space to grow! Service was also fantastic!  Friendly and attentive.Great addition to Leslieville!",1
By far my favorite place in Charlotte!! I could eat here every day! :) Great atmosphere and food. The lamb lollipops and bone marrow are amazing!!,1
"If you want to very best New York style delicatessen in metro Phoenix, this is the place!  My family has been coming to Miracle Mile for about two years now, and have never had anything short of a great dining experience each and every time.  Friendly, fast service with delicious high quality ingredients in every dish.  My personal favorite are the Papa Club, corned beef sandwich, and the cheesesteak.  One thing I would advise, come hungry! Everything comes as a generous portion.  If desert is your thing, they always offer a jumbo sized selection of pies and cakes.  Phoenix is in no short supply when it comes to NY style deli restaurants, but none come within a Central Park mile to the quality of Miracle Mile!",1
"These tacos win ""best of phoenix"" (in my mind).  I personally love a good el pastor taco and these rock, one tip, ask for extra pineapple.  Carne Asada is also pretty damn good too! Looking forward to getting back soon to try more items!Overall, you can't go wrong.",1
Came in after the Saint Patrick's Day Parade. Bartenders extremely accommodating and on-point! I am a germaphobe and all afternoon watching them and they are extremely thoughtful about sanitation.  Great spinach dip! Good beer selection.  Best choice this trip to Pittsburgh,1
"Could've sworn I wrote a review about this place but anyways I'll start by saying this is one of my favorite local spots to come to! Staff is always friendly and helpful, it's always clean inside and the food is pretty good for the price! Good place for locals or tourists come check it out!",1
Andy was very professional and quick to respond to my many calls and requests. Their price was very reasonable for the small project and I'd definitely call them for my next small or even large remodel project!,1
"With China aggressively buying up gas for their national strategic reserve and the price of an average Tesla costing more than the annual salaries of 3 1/2 fry cooks or 3 bank tellers or 1 top 25 fashion blogger, the price of gas continues to outpace the growth of paychecks for the bottom 93%.The best way to keep your automobile related expenses down to the absolute minimum, is to not have a car at all and bum rides off of your friends and/or learn to appreciate biking in 100 degree heat to your destinations.  If that option is not suitable for your personality type or lifestyle, driving less and carpooling more, and use GasBuddy and other similar gas price comparison websites and app is the way to go.  Costco is usually the lowest or very close to the lowest price in the area, plus with cash back benefits from most credit card companies like American Express, it is hands down the cheapest refueling option.Having a Costco membership or knowing someone that does is essential to minimizing the size of pie categorized for gas purchases relative to your overall expenses.Oh before I forget, this Costco gas location is at the Costco Business Center on MLK. The lines are typically a lot shorter than the ones at other Costco gas locations. A huge plus, since why waste gas idling your car while you wait to fill up on cheap gas? Just follow the lanes clearly marked for the lines you are queuing up in and completing this errand will be as painless as possible.So with that out of the way, who is available to shuttle me to and from work?",1
"I was here yesterday, I know it's only been a day, but so far, I'm pretty happy with the results.Making an appointment - this is tricky, they are open for extended hours, but with only 3 chairs, they can only take so many clients.  When you call, pick a day (of the week), and they'll tell you when the next available appointment is ~ on average it's about 2 weeks out, but up to 4 weeks to do get a time that works best with your schedule.  Also, they don't call you the day before to confirm your appointment.Overall, I'm really happy with the experience.  I got a hair cut and a digital perm, the price was $115, about $130 with taxes, and with tip, $160.  It was my first digital perm, and my hair can be stick straight, so I may have to update this in a few weeks.Kazuma was my stylist and he is seriously meticulous, from the way he trimmed my hair, and created bangs, to applying chemicals to prep my hair for the perm.  It was really quite amazing.  I will definitely be back, hopefully it can be 6 weeks from now, b/c I'll have to call back in 2 weeks to make an appointment for then!",1
"Great experience.  Easy reservation, price was reasonable.  Text for pick up was waiting when I landed. Driver was very courteous & friendly! Will definitely use Uptown again soon.  Thank you",1
"Came for my parents 59th wedding anniversary, service was great and the food was awesome. Started with the seafood tower, and wished I had ordered more! My wife and I shared the wagyu tomahawk ribeye and it had great flavor and was cooked a perfect medium rare. The side dishes were great, appreciated the family style servings, the star of the side dishes was the Mac and cheese and the lobster mashed potatoes. For dessert they brought out a butter cake and another dessert for my parents to share which had happy 59th anniversary written in chocolate on the plate, they thoroughly enjoyed it and my dad was asking when we could come back. : )",1
"Definitely one of the best fine dining establishments in Phoenix. Chef Beau MacMillan (Food Network chef, Iron Chef) is a master in the kitchen. The restaurant has an incredible ambiance, as it's nestled in the Camelback mountains, overlooking the Phoenix area. The windows allow for a panoramic view of the skyline. Inside it's sleek and modern with a very elegant feel. The fireplaces throughout the restaurant make it very romantic.Both waiters were very friendly and knew the menu quite well. That had great attitudes and were very patient with us.The bread is amazing, served with herb butter. They also brought us some edamame to start, that were well seasoned with Asian spices.I started with the escargot pot pie. It wasn't the traditional French style, but was a very interesting take. It had mushrooms, an Asian sauce, and perfect pastry crust. It was amazing.I had he duck for my entree. Absolutely amazing. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. It wasn't greasy at all, which is a common problem with duck. The duck breast was served with a confit duck leg too.The brussel sprouts with kimchi bacon were the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. And for dessert, the deconstructed S'mores was impressive in both design and taste.",1
"I love the setting and I understand how it can be intimidating for religious people. I am Christian but I am  not a Puritan. Church is a building and if you use it  for beer obviously is not a church and it becomes a brewery.  They have great variety of beers and good food.  I had the pious monk dunkel with 5,5% and my husband the  had lost love stout. We are big funs of dark beers.  The service was excellent and the place is really big.",1
This place was amazing and I especially loved my server Whitney! She was fantastic and really knows how to treat customers! My family and I will definitely be coming back due to the great food and wonderful service!,1
"When guests are in town, we take them here for beer. The staff is always so friendly and they know how to brew a good cold one. Don't skimp out on the food, their pizzas and bar bites are top notch. I wouldn't change a thing about this brewery.",1
"An update to my original review, I just learned that those Curry Wings are something off the menu so please keep it a secret or they won't let me come back.Now how about that Fresh skin on Haddock fillet I keep asking about G&D? If you do decide to serve it sometime please make sure you order them in fresh 10lb trays from Boston, put it on Facebook and I'll be there to consume an order or maybe even two I miss it so much. Now something like that would pretty much sum up my fish on Friday dilemma in this dusty old town.",1
"Randy saw me trying to figure out the hours on the door. He came and unlocked the door and said we're closing up, but you can be our last customer. Unfortunately they had just poured out the tea for the night. They kindly offered to get me something else or at least a water. I thought they were kind and I appreciated them both. What great workers!",1
Dimsum at the Wynn? Yes. Is it legit? Yes. Will i return. Yes. Wasnt it expensive? Who cares*must order Shumai.,1
"These guys are the best, and their food is fantastic. Make sure to try their burger place next door too!",1
"Treated home for termites, checked it afterwards and provided a great warranty. I highly recommend.",1
"This place is a staple for my family and I when it comes to eating Phō. It's always very clean, friendly staff and great service! The food is excellent, would highly recommend!",1
One of those 'don't judge a book by its cover' places.  The decor is pretty drab BUT this place is amazing.  I've never had such delicious CRISPY fried chicken. Not sure how they do it but the chicken is so crunchy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside.  10/10 in my books! I met my friend here as per his recommendation.  I probably never would have tried it if he didn't say such good things. So glad he did. Definitely on my list of preferred restaurants.,1
I went to Le Cabaret/ Paris Casino in Vegas with some friends after a Pitbull concert on 03/19/16 and continued the fun dancing with the great band that was playing. I backed into a very distinguished cute guy (literally backed into him while dancing) and enjoyed dancing with him cause he felt good and not creepy. Only regret is I did not get his 411. So Matt from Alaska...thank you for the dances!,1
Levi was tremendous - he came out quickly and changed out 10 different locks for us and even came back and helped us out change in addition a lot. We highly recommend him and think that he's an excellent Locksmith.,1
"Excellent, delicious food and wonderful service! A favorite of ours for years. Everything on the menu is delicious. Warm, welcoming and fun atmosphere. Always enjoy our time at Cornerstone.",1
"I always have a good experience here with both the delicious food and attentive staff. I'm never disappointed when trying something new on the menu. Of course, the sushi and sashimi are the stars of the show. Never a complaint with anything I've tried. If I could offer one criticism it would be the saki bomb included with some of the combos. Replace it with something complimentary to the meal. Cheap saki adds nothing.",1
"Best Italian Hoagies anywhere!! Delivery is fast. Prices are great. We got tired of Adrian's and Vocelli's and one slice of meat on their hoagies. Haven't had their pizza, but the hoagies are great!",1
"Ate here on our recent stay at wynn. Food was really good. The service is so so, but the food makes up for it.  Ordered  red curry and pad ke mao.  Also tried the roti curry. Thai tea was good also. Nice place to have lunch and hang out .",1
"Love this place, everybody is very friendly and they accommodate you with whatever you need. Is all in one place and the prices are incredible!!!!",1
"WOW.I would have NEVER come in if my friend didn't work by and needed something quick.   The food was good, the service amazing (Kim the shift leader checked on us and was always friendly and was always smiling) and the ambiance SO FUN!!!! I was eating and singing the whole time!! Thanks for taking care of us Kim!!",1
"My husband and I had a doctor appointment in this area.  After the appt, we felt an urge for good pizza so we ran into 'Franks' and boy was it good!!!  Delicious pizza was served & decided to try Shrimp Fradiavlo.  Those shrimps were the best we've ever been served and the sauce was outrageous!!      We are from New York and know what good food is.  Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes!!!  You should give this restaurant a try as you will not be disappointed!",1
Since my last post everything seems a lot better and we've been there probably over 20 times. Maybe it was just a bad day that they were having at the store anyway five stars for sure.,1
"This place has excellent food and even better service! I like the shredded beef wet burrito and the Organic margarita, 1/2 off during happy hour, was amazing!!! I eat here a lot but dined in for the first time yesterday! My mom and I absolutely loved it!!!",1
"This place serves the best, most authentic Korean food I've ever had. The Spicy Pork Hot Stone was my favorite and really made the restaurant memorable, but the seafood soft tofu soup and the quality of the usual small Korean sides definitely helped. This restaurant is  a hidden gem in Mesa, and although the service wasn't always the best, the food MORE than made up for it. This place is absolutely worth a try, especially for those who have never truly tried authentic Korean food.",1
"This place is legit. All the hot pot and noodles you can dream of. Free rice, which is always a bonus for a young broke college student. Love coming here to sake bomb with my friends. And not only is the food good, it is a family-run business with great service. These people put their heart and soul into what they make and I, for one, appreciate it. Jimmy, you're the best, man!",1
My entire family was seen at Chandler Dental Health last week and I thought they did an outstanding job! Their staff is so friendly and welcoming and the dentist and hygienist were GREAT!! So happy that I found them!!,1
"We've been here a few times - very friendly folks, and it seems that the local management is very much involved with the place.  Note that although their webpage is on the Mandalay Bay website, they're actually not under that corporate umbrella, and the info on the page tends to be out of date.  Stop by the front desk or call to get the real details of their happy hour/etc.I keep coming back for the Beef Pelmeni on the bar menu - little warm beef dumplings in broth served with a yogurt sauce.Their cavi-hour is a good deal - during certain hours, it's a half ounce of caviar free when you get two drinks made with Russian Standard Vodka.  Sure - the drinks are not cheap - it's Las Vegas - but the Caviar actually makes this an excellent deal.They also have a small vodka vault.  Apparently, they rent out storage lockers in there, but you can also buy a bottle of vodka and spend some time in the vault in fur coats doing shots off the top of the decapitated head of the statue of Lenin they have out front.  They let you buy a half bottle ( still about $100 ) if there's only two of you, and you can take the part you don't finish home with you.  It's kind of cold in there, but a cool experience.  Our bartender came in with us and told us a little about the vault and the folks who pay thousands to store their vodka in there.Having been here a couple times now, I really like this place.",1
"Excellent flat crust pizza, build your own on gluten free or regular crust. Big selection of cheese, toppings, and meat!! Love it here!!",1
Great service! Phone screen got smashed on my gravel driveway. Got here at 745 pm when they closed at 8 he took my phone in the back and within 30 min had it fixed. Haven't had any issues since!,1
"Walking into Art Box is like walking into a wonderworld of all things beautiful and handmade.  When I'm in there it is like my eyes are having their own little celebration at this wonderland of eclectic goodies.  They have baby stuff, cute little kitty paintings, every type of awesome jewelry you can imagine, gorgeous crystal suncatchers, motivational posters, adorable little scrabble tile pendants, upcycled items that are unbelievably cool, scarves, wall hangers, candles, very detailed mosaics and amazing glass designs (plates, night lights, rings, hairpins, bracelets) done by one of the owners, Kellie.  You'll have a delight talking to the salesperson - everyone there is personable, fun, kind and they just seem to have a knack for knowing exactly what you want!  That's why I go back again & again - and that's HIGH praise from me!  My favorite item that I got from there is this gorgeous little tile that says 'dream' ... it hangs on my wall and reminds me to dream every day.  I love this little piece of inspiration!",1
This is one of the original Vegas nail shops. I have been coming here for years and if there's something you don't like about your nails (everyone is not perfect) they will fix it with no questions asked. Eva and Jenny are the only ones I will let touch my nails because I know they do good work and they take their time. If you want a good experience and great prices go here. It's not in the best neighborhood but it is a neighborhood shop with great people and loyal clients.,1
"I really like it here. I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious. The bean dip is always good, and the menu is constantly changing & seasonal.  They have one of the best happy hours in the city, and this place is a great place to bring a date, whether it's the first or the 50th.  They have a very good draft list as well.  The theme, as many have likely mentioned, is Caribbean.  That being one of my favorite cuisines, I really have nothing bad to say here.  They even have Carib beer!  It's brewed in Trinidad & Tobago...it's not necessarily special, but I've spend ~4 weeks in the country, and it brings back a ton of great memories.  If you haven't been here, you need to go.  It's location is not ideal in that it's in a relatively slow area of the strip, but this place is a real gem.",1
"Excellent service and food. The pork chops, shrimp and grits, salmon, and bread pudding are all delish. Excellent selection of cocktails. Will definitely be back.",1
I have been coming here with my family for about 2 years to get Snowcones  my kids and wife love. I live the tigers blood with ice cream.,1
"I have seen every great show in vegas, this blows me away, incredible, unexplainable! Go see the 4pm show before dinner, you will then talk about it all night! Worth twice as much as other shows, only other show that is as much of an experience is le reve at Wynn.",1
"Best dental practice in Phoenix! We have been thru many dentists including specialists that don't even hold a candle to Dr. Stanger and his highly skilled staff! We have been going to this dental office for 5 years and they have been great with quality of work including bridges, crowns and their billing! Ignore all negative reviews and go to this dentist! Tell them Johnny sent you. Strongly recommended!",1
"I want to build the Roman baths in my house!!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG, IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!We girls arrived at Qua around 3 pm to visit the facilities (I needed a nice soak.)  We were then ushered into the spa area and were given a tour and our locker info.  The first thing I did was jump in the shower to rinse off and ran to the Roman Baths!!  It was absolutely relaxing!!  We first went into the main bath, which had a warm temperature to soak for a while.  The reason why I want this in my house is that I love the waterfall effect from the tub!!  We then went over to the hot tub..  MY FAVE!!!  I was probably in there for a good half hour with the waterfall splashing my shoulders.  We then took naps on the heated stone lounge chairs in this steamy room (perfect for your skin!!)  I loved the sound from the overhead shower that helped lull me to sleep.  We felt so pampered just being there.Then we showered and got ready in the self salon area.  It was furnished with dryers, combs, curling irons, razors, cotton balls, straight irons, everything you'd expect from a high end spa.  We then went into the lounge area to relax.  I got some pineapple juice and pretzels to snack on.  It was great!  They offer tea, coffee, juices, fresh fruits and prezels.I can't wait to go back, but need to finish my tour of Vegas Spas ;)  Definitely recommended!!",1
I had searched all over town and contacted five places to repair my classic iPod fifth generation from 2006. Nobody was able to help me including the Apple Store. I was finally referred to cc repairz.  He replaced my battery in under 30 minutes and did a fantastic job. Very professional and fantastic customer service. Very reasonable prices.  I would highly recommend this business to anyone. I will definitely bring products here in the future.,1
We went to Buddy V's on our anniversary for wine and cheese.  We were very impressed with the portions on the cheese/salumi platter.  The wine was delicious and the service we received from Pete our waiter was outstanding.  We will definitely be back.,1
"My God, can I give this eleven stars?This is by far the best steak I have ever had outside of Maui.  Fair warning though, you have to know how to cook a steak.  They give you all of the spices you need to cook your own steak, along with enough butter that it negates any positive affects on your diet, but I would eat here every day if I had a home liposuction machine :D",1
"The Cosmopolitan has more than a few options to ""get your drink on"" but if you're looking for cocktails it's really between the Vesper and the Chandelier. The Chandelier  is flashier, louder, prettier, and more ""hip"" whereas the Vesper is quieter, more collegial, and serves the superior cocktails. The waiters are attentive and talkative; they'll described the various drinks to you if you have questions (the girls seated next to me had to be explained the difference between soda water and regular water). If you go here, make sure to order their eponymous drink, the Vesper of James Bond (book) fame. It's an incredibly alcoholic beverage made of gin, vodka, Lillet, and orange bitters (for coloring) which incredibly flows down with ease. Trust me, it'll be hard to stop at one (In the books James Bond says he drinks only a single Vesper at work but his, if I remember correctly, is twice as big as the ones served at the Vesper Bar). If you go to the bar midday/early afternoon it won't be too crowded but you can expect a decent and generally friendly crowd. While there I befriended a Romanian, an Australian, and an Italian, which was an amazingly diverse and jovial crowd.",1
Excellent customer service! Enjoyed the brisket and turkey. Don't pass up the flash fried spinach,1
"I have been buying from this company for about 15 years.I have lived in other states, same service! I mostly buy the frozen veggies. Their broccoli is amazing, corn tastes like just came off the cob! We love the green beans, they are little young and taste so fresh.We really love the salmon. It comes vacuum sealed and tastes very fresh, easy to prepare in skillet or oven and comparable in price to other places.I do cook from scratch and don't buy prepared foods but I would absolutely do it if I didn't love to cook. Delivered to your door, you set the schedule, every week every 2 weeks, what ever pleases you! I like that very much, never feel pressured. They will even leave it at your door with ice if you like (in AZ that's a good thing). Give them a try I don't think you will be disappointed even if you just try the broccoli!!!",1
"We had a great experience here, getting our puppers groomed.   We had previously gone to PetSmart, which did a nice job, but was a bit too clinical/mass production for our taste.  Animal Zen is the opposite of clinical/mass production.  One Con (sorry AZ):  when you first arrive it may seem a little chaotic.  Either the owners have several dogs or they have lots of day care doggos, and the doggos are permitted to free roam in the front lobby area (which is great, but it makes for a loud and somewhat crazy reception). The free range doggies are behind a fence, so no actual danger to pets or people as you walk in, but they are noisy which may alarm some doggos (or their owners LOL).  We were slightly taken aback and slightly worried about leaving our tiny guys. Pros:  Our fears were totally unfounded.  We had the chance to meet with the groomer, including socialization time with her and the puppers in a quiet room.  She listened to our requests carefully, and delivered exactly what we had requested.  The puppers look and smell fantastic.As importantly, if not more so, we felt like the puppers were treated with TLC and a personal touch while they were there.  The groomer understood that they were young (5 mos.) and new to grooming, and took care to make them comfortable.  They may have been penned at some points (not even sure about that) but she also mentioned that they were allowed to run and play in the grooming room.  Puppers came home calm and relaxed and happy which was awesome.   TL;DR:  we love shopping local, and had a fantastic experience here.  If you are expecting a hospital room environment then this isn't your place.  That said, if you are looking for a groomer with a personal touch who will do a great job and send home dogs who aren't stressed and would probably look forward to returning, this is the spot.  Thanks AZ!",1
There's something addicting added to their ramen! Lol having been raised in Japan my husband and I are very picky and this spot really hits home! Love the choice between thick or regular noodles (we love the thick noodle). They even have a kids portion!,1
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Cute restaurant! Good home cooking, friendly staff and a nice warm atmosphere. I had the pot roast my BF had stroganoff both were delicious dnd the soup forget the cup, order a bowl.  This place is worth a try! It's a great place for for pie and coffee as well!!!",1
Great foods and great service . Drive 5 hours from AZ. This a great foods to help me recover.,1
"A friend referred ya to Judy and her team. I called and she came out the next day and did measurements and talked about what we wanted. She provided a quote with 24 hours. We got five quotes and this company has the best pricing. A week later we finalized and she went with us to 3 stone yards and one tile place to make our selections. We had our revised quote later that day. Ron came out two days later to take final measurements. The following Monday we went to look at our quartzite and sign off. They started with that same Thursday they started working, it took three full days and everything is just perfect. I highly recommend this company.",1
Found this place via Yelp and went here right after flying into town.  We came on the perfect night as the Sea Food Circus was on special for Tuesday night.  I went with the managers recommendation of the Mediterranean Sea Bearm and it was excellent!I would highly recommend this place as both the food and service were excellent!,1
AMAZING...... I am a wings lover had wings here.... And now i cannot have wings anywhere and be satisfied.....plz go on ur first day to vegas. Dont repent it going on the last day like me... Really cheap compared to a signature restaurant.,1
"Delicious filter coffee!!! A lot of choices of vegan milk, great pastries, super cute space. My only complaint is the size of the bigger cup, I need me an even bigger morning coffee lol!",1
"My friend got a cake as a wedding cake last month, it was so beautiful and sweet. So I came here to have a try. Highly recommend!",1
"Friday night post event find- right across from hannys.Decorated like a dark ""gastropub"" this spot has a little patio area with a bar & booths inside.The prices are reasonable for wine all under $9.  I also try the kebobs which are homemade yummy goodness.  Served over green beans the chicken kebobs also have onions, peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  This dish is served with a corn salsa.  I would make this at home!  The food was served hot but I would have liked a minute or two more on the green beans.  Most of the chicken had a nice light char.Our server Karen was very nice & helpful without being overbearing!  This is a gem in downtown Phoenix.",1
So great!!! Plenty of options to choose from and super great food. The vibe is very friendly orientated and the little shop inside is really cute and filled with awesome souvenirs!!!,1
Best dog groomers in Vegas! I highly recommend! My dog Lolo looks amazing after leaving and he loves going for his grooming.,1
"First thing to mention .... to those whom complain about it being to pricey !  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ?  ....Burger King .....This is a landmark tourist destination and like any tourist attraction there will be lines and associated cost !The view at night is SECOND TO NONE !!!!The menu is CANADIAN ... featuring the best beef in the world ...ALBERTA ( AAA )  BEEFThe food was Fantastic  !!!The deserts were decadentIf you are looking for a night out for a special occasion dinner, go to the 360...make reservations and show up after 7pm to avoid the longest linesIf your looking to be a chronic complainer and expect everything for free...May I suggest a street meat cart !!!!",1
"Renaissance is like a Salvation Army or Value Village with a solid focus on supporting the local community. This one is 3 stories under the weird and wonderful arches of the Plaza St Hubert. It's hit or miss because that's how second hand shopping works, , and I've never had the best luck here but I love it anyway.",1
We really are always pleased when we have a meal here. The staff is very polite and the choice and quality of food is right on. I think they are fairly priced too. It's also nice to join their cpk loyalty pgrm-lots of perks. So when you cant decide give CPK a shot-something for everyone,1
"I've been here a few times and it is always very good!I had wings the last time and they were good, but I had to go back for a steamed burger again this trip and it was great!If you are looking for a really good burger that's just a little different, check this place out, you won't be disappointed.  This last trip they were a little busy and the service was iff just a little, but I stayed with 5 stars because our waitress was really hustling through a busy crowded time on a weekend evening.  We also sat outside this time.  They have a nice little courtyard with a big screen TV so you can see local sports while you eat.",1
"Prompt, friendly, knowledgeable service. Keeping his number and recommending!! Thank you, Dave.",1
"I was personally referred by Dream Catchers Corp after My Hair~Tastrophe!!!  I booked over the phone and not only did the person set up my appt but was Very Knowledgeable and agreed to put me with The Lead Stylist/Manager at the time!!!  I LoVe their professionalism, hair extension contract, ease of re-booking and high standard of Quality Items and Care for Me as The Client!!!  Very Happy Locks of Gold!!!",1
Nice family atmosphere.  Seems everyone that works here is family or good friends of the owner.  Always feel welcome when our family eats here.  Everything we have eaten has been great.  Love all the unique items on the walls.  We always try to sit in the booth with the military items.  Cool joint.,1
"Everything was perfect--Eleanor was very attentive without interrupting conversation, food was fresh and delicious, ambiance was beautiful! I love that this place is tucked away and exactly was is to be loved about Arizona!",1
"We used Shake It Up (Chris, specifically) for my 40th birthday, and he was perfect for the event.  Chris did a great job mixing the drinks on the menu we created. He kept up with a thirsty crowd all night (~ 35 people) with multi-ingredient cocktails (think black cherry manhattans, not rum and cokes)! He was very personable with our guests, yet unobtrusive. Arrived early to set up and his departure was not disruptive at all.  Very communicative owner, and planning for the event was easy.  Price was reasonable, and we will be using Shake It Up (and requesting Chris) for other medium-to-large parties we throw.  Seriously, use them.  We could not have been happier with how it turned out.",1
We brought in our PS4 and my son's laptop here last Saturday. They have fixed and cleaned our PS4 and it's running smoothly again! We are looking forward to picking up our laptop soon!Everyone we've met here has been professional and nice and we highly recommend them!,1
"Great friendly staff, clean establishment with reasonable pricing and really gentle with kids.  My daughter didn't even shed a single tear :)",1
"I stopped here to meet someone who was buying jewelry, but got stopped by a pigeon who had gotten it's feet stuck in plastic, was losing a toe, and hangning upside down from a bush......yes, I'm getting to the Starbucks.....They let me HAVE a box knife, to save it. They wouldn't take the box knife back, because they don't contaminate, very safety concious. The drinks they made us were delicious,and the guy knew all the different ins and outs of the subtle flavors, and advise us as to which we would like best. They were GREAT! Very out of my way, but if I'm ever driving by I will stop again. Pigeon was fine, by the way. :)",1
"A required stop on every visit to the Strip. Best selection of Pasta, cheeses and meats. Try the Antipasto salad at the Olive bar. It's the best!",1
"Delicious food in a great location!! The drink selection is also great. We sat outside on the patio and were able to watch college football while eating. The service was pretty good, did seem a little slow and not sure if we were forgotten about or if the server was simply busy with other tables inside. Definitely won't hesitate to return though!",1
"I had shoulder surgery a while back. My shoulder was very messed  up and  I had  a torn bicep. This place is very good. Great bedside manner. I had a lot of questions and the doctor have a lot of answers. The  day after the surgery had to call the office because the pain meds that he had given me were not doing the trick. They called me back immediately and my husband was able to drive straight over there and pick up a new prescription. It was very much appreciated. My son just broke his ankle and had to get surgery. Even though Dr. Weinstein was out of network with my insurance, i made sure that we used him anyway.",1
"Oh! Here comes my shrimp curry special! I'll have to edit this later, if I don't have too many pints of Durham's Red Dragon cask ale.",1
"In and out real quick with the help of Robert K, such a pleasure to work with. Today's purchase was small but we'll be back for our big ones!!",1
"Dive bar. In a shady area, but WAY worth it. Some of the best pizza in Vegas and by far the BEST Caesar salad (bc of the dressing) I've had. I order the guinea pie every time. And they have beer towers. Always a plus. But the pizza is just the best.",1
Loved this place. Super food!  Reasonable prices!  Friendly and efficient staff.  Becoming my hang out!,1
"We took advantage of restaurant week at this place. This is a nice clean restaurant which most true European restaurants are. We had great service by Walter who sat us. To the ones who say they were rude...I say this...This is not Olive Garden or the tacky restaurants when they write their name in crayon on your table. If you never been to the real Italy or New York, you might think it is rudeness but it is not. The food here was Awesome. I had the spaghetti with meatballs (yes, I know meatballs is an American thing but it is hard to find good ones). The red sauce was excellent! The calamari was great. Tiramisu which is either made right or wrong was spot on! The pork chop was supper tasty. I totally recommend this place and I will be back.",1
"Yo, amazed at the service and walk-in ability that I was able to get. The manager and servicemen talked through each process and explained everything to me. I was in and out full oil change and service of my vehicle within AN HOUR. Couldn't talk or hype this spot up anymore than this already but I'm really glad to have found this spot",1
Food was great... service was great... mango mochi is the best!!! My date was even better ;),1
"We bought a couch from here recently, and were more than pleased.  The furniture is great - and unique.  The owner, Jonathan, and the people who work there are incredibly friendly and helpful.  We bought our couch on a Saturday afternoon and it was delivered (by Jonathan himself) on the following Tuesday. Super easy and pleasant. We would definitely buy from here again (in fact, we are looking at some other pieces already!).",1
Delicious. Loved their bakery. It tastes so fresh and their quiche and Crepes are so delicious too. Yummy!!!!!,1
Loved my experience! I called ahead because we wanted a family deal. I spoke with Selena over the phone and she was fantastic. We were a little bummed they didn't have any corn on the cobs for our side but she made it up to us with a coupon. Thanks so much for awesome customer service Selena! We will be back again!:),1
"i've been going to this Starbucks to do my homework/study since I was a freshman in college and all the baristas are so sweet and friendly. Cheryl is super sweet and she works mornings here and gets my order right every time. in the evening, i usually get Austin or Billy who takes my order and they know what they're doing too. Dom is the manager here and he always makes sure everyone is taken care of. love this location :))",1
"Hey Jolie's ... You just might be my new favorite Sports Bar!! We had a party of 7 and your service could not have been better. Our wait staff was quick, efficient, knowledgeable, and didn't ever forget one item. She was fantastic (a bartender I believe...) Anyway - the Sunday morning Football breakfast items were all really delicious, especially for a bar. So thank you for that. We couldn't stop talking about you all week long. Thanks a bunch... see you soon.",1
"Great spot for breakfast. I had the bacon and egg sliders, my wife had the black bean burger; both were great. The service at the bar was outstanding.",1
"We absolutely loved it here. Its not a romantic setting, if that is what you are looking for. Many guests were dressed down and some were actually wearing hoodies and sweatpants which surprised us. We went for my birthday so I was dressed up. But thankfully, dressing up still goes with the restaurants environment. The service was noteworthy for a positive review. All servers were very kind and polite, and man do they make sure you are doing okay. The food was good. So for $54 per person, it's basically all you can eat. There is a food bar to start with. Includes salads, cheeses, soup, rice, veggies, etc. Then the meats (beef, chicken, lamb) are brought to your table upon request and served onto your plate. We got full very fast. The meats were delicious. They're signature drinks are very tasty. And they gave me a complimentary slice of cake with a candle.",1
Probably one of the best kbbq experiences I've ever had Eugene our server was amazing...thanks dude!,1
"I am a new patient of Dr. Kintonis and had a pleasant experience. I moved to Dr. Kintonis because of Carol Izzo, dental hygienist.  I have been with her for almost 20 years and I would follow Carol anywhere!   The wait was a little longer than I prefer but worth it.",1
This little bar and grill/ restaurant is really good. I've been here 4 times now and have had a good experience every time. The drinks are great and the chicken wings are AMAZING. They always have weekly flavors for wings and specials.  The owner is amazing very personable. The happy hour specials you can't beat. If you get a chance I recommend stopping by. They are still new and need some exposure until they get busy. The place ( plus the bathrooms!!!) had a very clean and have a sleek feel to them.  The employees are friendly and attentive! Definitely stop by and try it!!!! You won't regret it.,1
"From the chicken to the staff, everything was a 10 plus.This is fast food but done better than the rest.",1
"Classic barbershop service with a newer Cali-Tattoo shop tyvibe.   My man, Chino, hooked it up with a haircut and a shave.  Great service, and great conversation. Next time I am in town I will definitely be stopping by for a cut, and to chop it up with my Filipino brother.",1
"Darahrah (name on her mirror) is awesome. I have gone to ""spas"" that charged me over $125 for a hair cut and were not as good as what she did. My hair looked great and stayed looking great even after I washed it. Usually,  I leave a salon and it looks okay, but I can't make it look the same. I am so happy I found this talented beautician.",1
"If you're looking on a way to spend a couple hours, I highly suggest you spend it here. First, the staff is so friendly and they help you through the whole tour. They are sure to help you with where to go and even tell you about daily events going on when you visit.Second, the gardens are beautiful! You cannot find a better place for peace and mind than here.Thirdly, they're always busy, good thing for them but if you aren't a person for waiting or sometimes stopping randomly for that guy who wants to take a picture of everything, then I suggest you avoid the wait.",1
"I HAVE NEVER SEEN A DENTAL OFFICE MORE GORGEOUS!!!! I felt like I was at the spa  when I came, not getting my teeth done. The staff are more than welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend this dentist to anyone living in the area, they really know what they're doing. You will not be disappointed!",1
"Excellent food at this place. Little trendy but service was good. Normal Mexican fare w/a twist. Restroom is on the Casino floor, was the only downside.",1
"Brioche was soft and moistSandwich cookies in a variety of fun flavors:  peanut butter caramel,  lemon blueberry, strawberry & cream. Service is pleasant and helpful for new comers like us.  Willy street co-op had their baked goods in their store,  so I figured I'd check out what else they had.  Super sweet chocolate chip cookie was perfect with a cup of coffee. We'll be back for more treats!",1
"What a great spot, speakeasy with prohibition style drinks, and tapas small plate meals. I love this place! The owner checks in on all the guests, the staff are super personable, and attentive, with great knowledge of all the drinks and menu if you aren't even sure what you're into - I have yet to be disappointed with their recommendations. Big shout out to Darren who took care of us, I wish I remembered everyone's name we've encountered because they are all great! Good food, great drinks, fantastic hangout!",1
"Both the dealership AND the salesperson were commendable !Kent Trapp's years of experience doing one thing: matching customers to the car fitting their needs, is priceless.I came in thinking I wanted a cute orange munchkin (Prius C) only to come to grips with the reality, my orange crush was a serious mismatch for the car's usefulness with respect to my work.The dealership supported Trapp's desire to help me acquire a more appropriate choice by allocating a generous trade-in value for my car and by disclosing Toyota's mandate to offer a rebate for my paying for the car versus financing it.I was thoroughly irked when I realized that a different Toyota dealership felt justified in ignoring the Toyota's rebate mandate.  We are talking about $1,000!Kent Trapp taught me to pair my dumb phone with the car's Blue Tooth and introduced some additional ""fun"" features of my vehicle AFTER the sale had been completed.Trapp is intelligent and sensitive to specific car issues. He did not hesitate to have a beeping feature modified by their service department.  I honestly had a positive car buying experience, thanks to this gentleman.",1
"This time around I was the one on the receiving end as my wife got me a gift of massage. Easily the best massage I've gotten because no one else works all the muscles and joints like Jesse does, thanks a lot!",1
"So happy this place opened! We get Milo's quality food with reasonable pricing. Cute, small and familiar place with a welcoming staff. The food is absolutely delicious. We love the grilled fish, baked feta, all of the salads and dips and lamb chops",1
"An underrated gem - remains, somehow, one of the best-kept secrets in Cleveland dining. All three experiences I've had there have been memorably positive. Very inventive ingredient combinations, diverse menu, pleasant ambiance.",1
Awesome mani pedi on late notice. We come to Vegas a couple times a year and this place is DEFINITELY on my radar now! I called last minute and quickly booked and appointment for the next morning. Arrived 15 min early cause that's just who I am as a person. The downstairs receptionist forgot to tell my manicurist I was there but I got passed it. Had a super relaxing time and very pleased with the quality of work.,1
"Pulled pork fried rice bowl was incredible! Get the egg on top upgrade. Wonderful staff, great 3pm happy hour apps.  Best Thai I've ever had and I've had plenty.  Forth time in 2 years and it just gets better.",1
"i come here at least once a fortnight, maybe more. they have consistantly great burritos, and good service. as far as rubios are concerned, this is the best in phoenix. as far as any mexican resteraunt is concerned, this is one of the better ones, not taco bell, but not tia rosas.",1
"A collision shop is not where you like to frequent, but between mine and my daughters cars, we've returned to this location more than a couple of times. I wouldn't take our family automobiles anywhere else. From the office staff that first greet you when you walk in (Ashley and Garrett are amazing!), to the incredibly friendly and knowledgeable service advisors (Mike and Adam rock!), to Caleb who detailed my 100K+ mile car and made it look new again...they all have great attitudes. And the results of the work completed on our cars has been top notch. This is the place to go when you need knowledgeable, reliable and friendly service.",1
Absolutely some of the best food I've had. Highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner. Parking can be a pain but it's worth it.,1
"I just had my windows installed with these guys and they were very good. The whole experience was very pleasant. The guys came out, installed the windows, and they even cleaned up their mess. One glass installed was not exactly what I ordered, but the General Manager called me back and told me they would replace it at no cost. That was a hug plus. I thought I would have to pay for another few hundred dollars for that. Overall I am very happy. Thanks American Vision Windows",1
"Thank you Minit Lube for just being helpful and kind! I was driving home from work with low pressure in my two front tires. I saw it earlier and I could feel it as I was driving. And since I had gone to this location a couple times for oil changes and the service was great I decided to just drive in and see if they could check my tire pressure and maybe top it up with some air.They did it no problem. They suggested what was open around in the area in case I need more service. The staff was kind and easy-going and helpful. The kind woman working there just checked my pressure, filled it up with a smile and told me to have a great weekend.Really cool. I've only had good experiences here. They've always only ever been truly helpful. Plus it is a convenient location. It's right off of Macleod Trail. And the store set up is equally as convenient. You just drive in and the equipment is set up for them to work on your car right there and then.",1
SumoMaya came recommended by my wife's co-worker. The spicy tuna roll was so amazing that I ordered another! The pad Thai was the best my wife and I have ever had! Korean BBQ tacos were good as well! Service was top notch! It was loud inside but all together amazing place to eat!,1
One of our favorite places! Great gluten free menu & the salmon is to die for. Nice wine selection & one of our go-to's for date night.,1
"One of my favourite spots in the Village. Brunch is wonderful, and if you're there for dinner, I'd recommend the Southern Fried Chicken or the Butter Chicken Grilled Cheese. Request to sit in David's section if he's working. He's wonderful. A few nights ago I arrived with 7 people (and no notice) and he managed to do some rearranging and squeeze us in -- even though it was the middle of Pride Week. Love him!",1
"I'm so glad I stopped by today but I need a bigger stomach. I had the Chorizo with Sweet Potato and Regular Potato waffle fry stack. Omg. Amazing. I had the eggs over medium. The food was delicious. The jalapeños were hot, the chorizo was great, everything was awesome. The service was awesome as well. I think I just found a new favorite!",1
We had lunch here and it was great! Erik was super friendly and helped us make the best choice as to what to order! He checked in multiple times and provided excellent service. We hope to be back here when we are in town again,1
"I've driven past this bright spot many times and have never needed to pop in until last weekend. Don't be intimidated by the size people, the employees are mega helpful and ready to answer any of your questions. I was able to find the perfect DSLR for my aspiring photographer girlfriend at about 2/3 the price I had initially budgeted, so with the extra clams I ended up finding her a super awesome camera case as well. I'm already looking for another reason to return... next on the purchase list, terabyte hard drive for the gagillion photos she has already taken.   WIN!!",1
Wonderful staff wonderful coffee as well as educational.If you enjoy fresh roasted coffee this is the placeBig variety of beans as well as a great coffee bar.,1
"This is my husband's and my favourite date night restaurant and we are here at least once a month.  I am surprised by some of the critical reviews because we have always found the food and service to be consistently excellent. We have gotten to know Greg and always look forward to an evening of chatting with him. We love the casual atmosphere as the food is fine dining quality but without a pretentious atmosphere. We enjoy the quaint yet casual atmosphere and being quite social we often end up chatting with others around us. Our favourite appetizers are the Arancini and the Embarcadero Oysters and we always have at least two dozen fresh oysters and often order seconds of the Arancini and Embarcadero Oysters. For entrees we enjoy the steak, lamb, seafood pasta and the lobster angel hair pasta. We find the quality of the food far surpasses the price of the food. After dining there last night we made a reservation for NYE and we can't wait to bring our friends to this hidden gem.",1
"This place is amazing! The food is excellent and a huge variety; even the coffee is amazing.If you come, ask for Gino and get his recommendation on what to have, you won't be disappointed.",1
"I love this place!  The white Sangria and the Moscow Mule are my favorite drink items.  You can get the mule with various different flavor combinations.  The short rib slider melts in your mouth - highly recommended.  As far as the exotic burger of the day, try out the ostrich, pheasant or wild boar - deelish.In addition to some great sliders, sides and drinks - the staff is excellent.  Friendly and helpful if you need a entree suggestion.  If you are in the Old Town area, stop in!",1
"We went to go see this show this past weekend and loved it! VERY well done Cirque du Soleil! A wide variety of talent, very enjoyable, and amazing, jaw dropping performances!",1
"I will go to La Rocca to order all birthday cakes from now on. I was looking for a unique cake that wouldn't break the bank for a friend's birthday. I would have ordered one of those custom cakes from private bakers, except the setting was a potluck birthday party...so a much bigger cake would have been needed. So I took a look at La Rocca and even found a pineapple cake (my friend loves pineapples). Never even knew those existed! I ended up ordering 1 pineapple cake over the phone, and 1 dozen cupcakes online. Went to pickup on the day of, with no hassle. Got so many compliments on both the cake and cupcakes!Some things to know:- difference between online vs. instore/phone - the cakes you can order online are from their factory, and are less decorated. The cakes you see in-store on display are made in the Creative Kitchen - they are more decorated and a little bit more expensive (but still overall very affordable). I originally wanted to get a pineapple cake from the factory, but I saw just how pretty the pineapple cake in-store looked, so i went with the one in-store instead. The flavors of their factory cakes vs. in-store cakes are different too.- adding a name on the cake will go on a plaque - additional cost of $2 (if i remember correctly)- they can take orders over the phone as well, even if you are paying by credit card- you can specify a pickup date. the pickup time is as early as the store opens on whatever date you specify. - peanut butter cupcakes are the bomb. so rich and smooth without being heavy ... highly recommended!- the packaging for the cake is genius. most cake boxes you have to 'deconstruct' and 'unfold' the cake box and then slide out the cake. this one, there is actually a dotted line for you to tear out the cardboard part the cake is sitting on. no mess and no slide needed.",1
I would highly recommend Susan to anyone looking for a tailor!  I called her up about two weeks before my wedding and she was able to get my alterations done on time and everything was done so well.  I thought what she charged me was very fair and I liked that you can tell that she truly loves what she does.  She wanted to make sure my dress fit perfectly on me and I appreciated that so much!  I will be sure to go back to Susan for any future alterations needs.,1
Brought my three-year-old Aussie for grooming and they did a fantastic job. Seems a little pricey for a bath and brush but you do get what you pay for!,1
"Update:Quiet riot show.... BLK live kicked it up a notch and rocked it!CONGRATS TO BLK!!!Update:  keep reading till bottom......WAS Digging on this place for the last few months since they've started the 'hair bands' playing. Decent prices, good sound, above avg prices in drinks.  No longer dog them. Here's why: Have changed my opinion due to a very easily resolvable issue, that unfortunately the manager refused to resolve. I was honest about the miscommunication among friends about how many tickets we originally pre purchased.  We purchased an extra at the door. 2 minutes after we purchased the extra ticket the door lady said no problem, what here and the manager will help you with a refund. After waiting for 20 minutes (no exaggeration -and missing some of the music), manager finally arrived. I openly and politely told him the scenario; we accidentally purchased 1 extra ticket. He refused to refund but offers tickets to upcoming shows that I advised I had already purchased since I dig the venue. Instead of recognizing the continued patronage and thanking me for that, then refunding 30$, he advised there is nothing he can do... as the manager there is nothing he can do. Seemed odd he didn't offer a a free drink (or 2), or simply the cash back.. which was the obvious choice since I'd spend it at the bar.... but no. He advised he was sorry but there was nothing he could do... such as goto the door person, get the cash I gave them, and give it back to me, he tried to walk away. I reminded him I have tickets to all upcoming (2018) bike week shows (I've proven my patronage), and he said sorry and walked away. Very poorly ran and obviously more concerned about revenue versus continued patronage/positive happy customers.   So in short, I won't purchase more tickets from this venue. Good luck to those who do. Was a very simple resolution. But $30 was worth more than future revenue. Update:Spoke to Rocco who did what was right..... refunded the unused ticket, made up for it with good conversation, like a regular ole person, made me and my friends feel at home. Invited us back for future fun and just hung out for a moment. We will be back now that he treated us right! He also advised he is working w his staff to mold then into customer satisfaction minded folks. Shared future plans for the venue, and was just a down to earth person.  Great role mode for the staff Rocco!We'll see ya at bike week (ZZ Top) for sure plus Frank Hannon (of Tesla) and for sure Quiet Riot. The simple act of treating us as decent people and refunding a measly $30 gained BLK Live future business w VIP $$, drink $$ and drink $$, word of mouth and overall great reviews.   Keep it up Rocco & gang!",1
Simply Posh is simply the best!!  I always find a quick top or dress to wear on the run. Great prices!!  Love Nicole!  Stop by her new store starting in August!  Now I have 2 places to shop! So proud to have such a great business in our neighborhood!,1
"Great experience from front desk gals thru cleaning, X-rays and dental work, very clean. Dr. Gregory is awesome.",1
"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. As a bachelor, I eat out a lot! The food is always on point. The prices are very reasonable. The staff is very friendly as I've gotten shots on the house multiple times. Their specials are great, such as the seafood circus as well as their oysters. I also like the fact that I can get good late night food in Toronto. Pretty much no downside to this place. Reviews should be higher. This is a place that doesn't need hype. It's just good!",1
Fantastic food. The food presented on the plate at the table was the same as the Yelp reviews for menus online aesthetically pleasing and fantastic and taste thank you,1
"I went in to Aloha Dental today and was pleasantly greeted by the ladies at the front desk. Their waiting room is very nice, and I didn't spend much time in it. They got me in within a couple minutes of my appointment and worked quickly. Dr. Gelo was very friendly and so were their hygienists. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, and I will definitely be coming back to Dr. Gelo.",1
"Excellent service, excellent burger, excellent steak, excellent chicken, excellent outdoor and indoor seating. Took my in laws the second time we went & they loved it! Great pricing as well!",1
Michelle is the ONLY person I will go to! Everyone is nice but she is amazing. Better make an appointment b/c she stays booked. P.S. I stopped my standing weekly appointment at fa ancy SP spa because Michelle was better!,1
"The best ""Greek"" omelette. Period!!! The best restaurant Owner... Period!!!The best staff!!!PERIOD!!!",1
"This place has consistently been great. Out of my four or five experiences here, I have never been disappointed. To start, the biscuits with rosemary butter and apple jam are delicious, and I could eat several servings as a main dish if I really wanted to. Outside of this, all of their chicken dishes center on juicy fried chicken, that I have had cooked perfectly every time. Along with this, they provide their own house made hot sauce that is one of the my favorites.Aside from this, they have an extensive whiskey selection, and are very knowledgeable when it comes to choosing whiskey to sip on, or to pair with your dinner. They have some quality, budget-friendly whiskeys, as well as specialty whiskies that will make everyone happy.The atmosphere is cozy at all times, and it is a great place to warm up in the winter. My favorite time to go, however, are on Wednesday's when they offer ala carte options for sharing with the table. It really lets everyone try a wide variety of foods, and adds to the cozy, family style ambiance the restaurant provides.Really give this place a try asap, I'm sure you won't regret it!",1
"I have very good experience with FirstMed, went to Eastern location and got my status approved, doctor visit copay is very reasonable, I can't thank FirstMed enough(and whoever fund the program) for doing this for low income, it really take off a lot of load off me worry about having to pay high copay in other doctor's office.  I was referred to Dr. Vital at Shadow lane location, she's very caring and understanding, and always take time to answer all my questions, all the staff at the front desk are very nice too.  I regret I didn't find out about this place soon enough.  Thank you FirstMed!",1
"This is a stellar restaurant in the midst of a sleepy downtown. If you are looking for a memorable meal in downtown Phoenix this is your place. The ambiance is great with gorgeous light fixtures and comfortable seating. They have a large bar for drinks with a good happy hour appetizer menu. At dinner, try the mussels in a garlic/ginger beee broth. The pappardelle sausage Ragu was delicious. Great place!",1
"I haven't seen a review for Dr. Haley on here and wanted to give him a shout out and HUGE thank you.I needed to have my gallbladder removed, the ER initially said it was non-emergency but that I did have stones, told me to follow up with a surgeon. After deliberation and not wanting any more attacks, I decided to have it removed. Turns out the ER sonogram was inacurrate and my gallbladder was extremely inflamed and more serious than originally thought. Of course, I had no idea as I was blissfully asleep under anesthesia, but I am so thankful for Dr. Haley's expertise in handling the surprise. He did such an amazing job and was still able to remove it laproscopically.My healing went great, I was pretty uncomfortable for a few days (to be expected), but I feel amazing right now. Dr. Haley is so kind and knowledgeable, I would recommend him to anyone. The office staff is very nice as well!",1
"Very good Thai food and excellent service. The restaurant is casual, brightly lit, and quiet. The waitstaff is very friendly, cheerful, attentive and prompt. We had the pad Thai and the pineapple curry, and both were delicious. The Thai coffee was delish too - creamy, with nice robust coffee flavor.",1
"I took my puppy to get his first puppy grooming.  He walked in Chubaka  and came out Luke Skywalker!  What a transformation,  Kim and Brittany took their time with my baby and helped him get comfortable!lThank you Kim for being so patient with my scared puppy!",1
"I have been in the search of the perfect nail salon and found it! I tried many places. Always a problem, too expensive, the people were rude, the nail art wasn't good, the gels didn't last long, the pedicure was awful. And then I found this place! I love it! The normal pedicure is a good price and a good pedicure! So pleased. What I am really over the top about though is the gel nail, and the person who did them. In a few days these gels will have been on for A MONTH! I can't believe it. Most gels you are LUCKY  to get 2 weeks. A month later no chips no cracks and no problems. And I am afraid I am not easy on my nails I totally use them as tools, and they are still good. Now the nail tech, Steven was AMAZING the designs he did are out of this world beautiful. I could go on and on raving about how amazing he was. Just an outstanding job. If you go you must make sure you get Steven. You will not be disappointed. And he was a very nice person.",1
"I have been taking my son Isaac to a kids place since he was born and would always have a melt down. I started coming here a few months ago and at first he had a small melt down but for over it quickly. The last few times we have come we see David and Issac just thinks he is so cool. He now sits like a big boy and can't wait to get his ""hair cup"" las he calls it. Love the place and always a haircut on point by David!!!",1
"Being a Foodnetwork junky I watched Top Chef Canada when it came out, so took an interest in Rob Rossi opened up a place. I finally made it there on Saturday - the food was all about the meat, here's what we had:Beef tartare - simple and delicious, topped with a couple of anchovies and quail's egg, rimmed with an intense garlic aioliCharcuterie board - a lot of it cured in house, served with a killer grainy mustard that was also made in houseDuck breast - with a cherry sauce, cooked to a perfect medium - medium rareButcher's cut special pork chop -  I can't remember the name, but the description makes me think it's the ""kobe"" of pork; served on the richest, creamiest grits I've ever tasted Service was on point, my dinner date described our server (Dillon) as the perfect amount of in your face/banter, food and bevvy knowledge. The restaurant itself was open, every table had a view of the open kitchen, and the man himself was cooking with four others (this was another key point for me, if I go to a restaurant for a specific chef I want to see him cooking my food). Music was lots of 70's early 80's rock - CCR, Cream, Police, etc. Also, bonus points for a very hot tatted up hostess. I'll be back at least two more times to try their cote de boeuf, and in force for the family style suckling pig.",1
"We were looking up different Chinese/American buffets in the area awhile back and came across this place. This is our 4th time eating here and a first for dinner. We really enjoy this place. It's definitely worth the price you pay for. And service is great for being really busy after 7 PM.The buffet is good, the soup is good, and the Sushi is fantastic. Definitely recommended if you're in the area.",1
"LOVE THIS PLACE! can't go wrong with their hot dogs and I love the weekly hot dog specials.  The southern girl dog is probably my favorite and you can't go wrong with a side of tots.  Follow their instagram for their weekly specials (warning: it will make you hungry).  They also have a great selection of beers, with good deals, and a rotating draught list! And don't forget to try their homemade pickles! I love the spicy ones.",1
This is a really relaxing lounge it is very clean and the staff is really nice great food selection and lounge area to take a nap until your next flight. They are also very helpful making sure you find your flight or connecting flight and if you decide to take a nap they will do wake up calls ensuring you make it on time.,1
"Torrey pines barber shop closedThis is a new shop from Santa Monica CA, Lino the Barber is a 19 year vet! Very precise and knowledgable. Shop is clean and classy. Masters all hair textures and styles! Gentleman grooming is his passion! His favorite cuts to do are gentleman cuts and flat tops! Don't get it wrong, he puts down a crispy fade and faux hawk! Shop environment is very friendly and family oriented. Jazz, reggae and classic rock can be heard mildly in the back round. (Sorry no rap or heavy metal) just easy listening! No vulgar language in the shop. $20 a cut may be pricey but well worth it! Pico barbershops offer fire fighter and police officers discounts! They also donate to ""American federation of police & concerned citizens!"" They will be sponsoring bonanza high school sporting events too!New phone number 310)4634563",1
"The BEST casual dining experience in a long time! This was highly recommended on our Scottsdale Segway Tour, and they were spot on. Great drinks, happy hour, and the food my wife and I had were awesome! The staff from the hostess to the Management is as friendly and welcoming as you will ever find in a restaurant. We will most certainly recommend to our friends and be back!",1
"Not sure why it took this long to try State 48, especially since I am anti-chain restaurant, but finally made it in tonite and will definitely be back. We were seated right away on the pizza oven side of the restaurant. The bar side sounded a little more exciting but we were fine where we were. Our server Nicki was great. As soon as we ordered wine and not beer, she ran to get us a couple samples of their craft beer. One blueberry and one raspberry. They were very good. I am a much bigger fan of wine so I stuck with my original choice but wouldn't completely dismiss the idea of ordering a craft beer in the future. Husband and I each had pizza. One Diavolo and one Meatball. Both were very good with fresh ingredients. I enjoyed watching the pizzas be hand tossed before they were crafted and fired. One warning...if you can't handle spicy, do not go with the Diavolo!! As much as we wanted to try dessert, we had our fill with the pizza. In fact there was plenty of pizza to take home. Next time I may just go for dessert and I might even try some sort of coffee beer that Nicki recommended. She really was great!!Lastly, what made the experience tonite complete was the Manager (Mario) stopping by our table to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. Already planning our next visit. See you soon, State 48!!",1
"I saw Dr. Dempsey for the first time this week for Botox. She is amazing! A fantastic bedside manner and her office staff was lovely as well. I am incredibly pleased with the results, and will be seeing her for all my injection/skin care needs going forward.",1
"This is a great Indian restaurant. We order from grub hub. Our food is always hot. They take care in the packaging ensuring no spillage. That's a plus. After all presentation is still very important in takeout.Today we ordered Vegetable Samosa, Vegetable Biryani, Garlic Naan, and Dal Tadka. Yes, yes, YES to everything. I really enjoy the Vegetable Samosa. I usually get two. This food is clearly prepared with love. Pure Indian Cuisine is one of my favorite places to order from.5 Stars",1
I just love these guyz amazing food and good customer service. Food is always amazing,1
"Food was Excellent, the ambience needs a lot of work. Highly recommended the spicy catfish and spicy eggplant with shrimp. I've tried a lot of Thai food in Vegas and this is my favorite so far. The ambience leave a lot to be desired but the food was amazing!",1
"Sneaky Dee's has, in my mind, long-since established itself as one of Toronto's foremost and most reliable purveyors of top-notch nachos. I've ordered the King's Crown many, many times over the years, and I've never been disappointed.We decided to meet at Sneaky's after work on a hot, humid Friday, and I was happy to note that the patio was almost empty. (If the weather provides for a patio experience in late September, one is more than willing to jump at the opportunity.)Though I'd love to try something else on their menu, we of course ordered the King's Crown nachos (Crisp corn tortilla chips covered with salsa roja, piled high with frijoles, ground beef, tomatoes, onions, mixed peppers, jalapenos, melted cheese, topped with guacamole & sour cream).Many restaurants and pubs across the city offer nachos with a similar list of toppings, and yet most prove unable to create the singular experience of the Sneaky Dee's plate of nachos. The biggest advantage the joint has over its various competitors is its refusal to skimp on any of the aforementioned toppings; virtually every nacho contains a bite of something delicious, and it goes without saying that there are hardly any naked nachos to be found here (which is sadly all-too-common with most plates of nachos).It's clear, as well, that the use of seemingly homemade ingredients plays a significant role in the King's Crown's massive success. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered nachos and almost wept at the use of canned salsa. The other ingredients are prepared equally well and although the bottom layer does tend to get soggy (a common complaint, I've noticed), I'll happily take a few mushy nachos over a heaping assortment of undressed ones.The whole thing is topped with an almost ridiculously generous helping of sour cream and guacamole, and honestly, I was in nacho heaven the entire time I was eating.Sneaky Dee's, do not change a thing.",1
"This is definitely THE place to have a romantic happy hour with that favorite person.  Sit on the patio next to the fire, enjoy the ambiance of the views of Camelback Mountain and the food and drink on the happy hour menu.  The servers are efficient, friendly and personable without being intrusive.",1
"Order the beef wellington. Yes, yes even you, you who doesn't like rare meat. I am you and I feel your hesitation from here, but know this, I am SO glad I was feeling adventurous as it was by far one of the best meals I've tried in my lifetime. It's THE only expensive meal I've eaten in Vegas that I thought was well worth the price tag. So go, go and be brave, full and happy.",1
We lived across the street from this restaurant and didn't know. We had it delivered after finding them on GH and it was amazing. Sad to say we are moving. Hopefully they have multiple locations.,1
"CLOSED as of September 26, 2016. Now a vape shop. Too bad because they really know their stuff. I hope they reopen soon.",1
"Throughout the northeastern United States, but most notably here in Ohio, the most difficult part of summer is always at the end. This is the time when we say goodbye. Yet, as the days grow shorter and the air takes on its chill, there are little reminders that life keeps giving, even as the days wrap themselves in darkness.    True, we will miss summer dresses and how they cling to bare legs, but there is consolation to be found in firm hug of a sweater. And yes, these are the days when the lush greenery of Lakeview cemetery begins to drift downward in swirling waves and like an ocean of gold and red, breaks and crashes on the rocks of weathered stone; memorials to countless summers gone by. The very air becomes a living, dying, metaphor for time's refusal to hold to any one day. The landscape becomes equal parts mosaic, illustrating the force of change, and scenic backdrop for nostalgia, breathtaking in its own right.    Yet, if the Cleveland connoisseur knows where to look, here is deeper comfort still and its just waiting to be found. This is the time of year when, within the most special of caprese salads, tomato has subsided to beat. A flavorful reminder that no matter how cold the winter on the lake may become, the Beach Club Bistro is the friend for all seasons. A friend who never says goodbye.",1
"I spend a few nights a week in Old Town, and will always end up at The Mint.  Their door staff, bouncers, and VIP host/hostess are all very nice and have spoiled me to no end, lol!  I like the more upscale vibe here, and was reminded of how well this club sets itself apart from others when I visited another venue just around the corner a week ago.  The D-bag factor was HIGH at the other club, not so much here.  It seems they actually pay attention to who they are letting through the doors at The Mint, which is a welcome reprieve from a lot of clubs in Old Town.  I saw one reviewer's posting about all the seriousness of The Mint's clientele...and while I've witnessed this a couple of times before, I attribute it to what I've experienced in other clubs:  I just get worn down some nights by all the 20-somethings getting flat wasted, making a scene, or hitting on me (I'm 42) and after a solid evening of that I just might be a tad antisocial myself, LOL!  But you generally don't find that at The Mint.  It's a safe place to hear great beats, hang out with good friends, and make a few new friends as well!They have a very good menu too, and I suggest going before club hours to sample it (although their kitchen is open during club hours as well!).  The Mint will ALWAYS be my go-to spot, and I always suggest it to visitors.",1
Excellent service!Very prompt and super courteous .  No wait!! My service person's name was Jay. I needed assistance with replacing a break light and he was very professional and attentive . I would definitely recommend visiting the 3415 S Maryland location . Thanks again Jay!!,1
"I'm usually not super crazy about fine dining because I would rather buy expensive shoes than expensive food :P My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and you definitely have to be in your best attire and behavior! I usually prefer a more laid-back atmosphere, but this is definitely one of few fine dining experiences that I found top notch, memorable and absolutely worth the money. No complaints really, except the interior decor is kind of bland, but the food makes up for it with the quality and layers of flavors!",1
Good collection of vinyl and equipment in a convenient location. Dean is great to deal with,1
Mind blowingly good. So many flavors and textures in one bowl and surprisingly very very filling. Definitely recommend!,1
"We order Guys pizza about once a month. The food is delicious and our order is always correct. The owner, Sean, is personable and clearly loves his business. The appetizers and burgers are amazing too!",1
Aug 2- 4 2013 had a great time will stay here again. Everything you could want in Vegas.,1
AWESOME FOOD! great quality beers on draft polite locals friendly staff and the Buffalo Wings are out of this world!,1
"Food is delicious, the menu and portions are HUGE, and the service has been outstanding at every visit. Great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Highly recommend.",1
"I have been to this theater in the past and haven't really been since they've updated. My wife and I came twice over the weekend and were very pleased. The look, feel and cleanliness were want you want from a theater. When you walk in, there is a good amount of self-serve kiosk and they are very simple to use. Better than others I've used, even at other Regal's. The ticket process is smoother than you'd expect. You go and hand the person a ticket like normal.The Friday night and Sunday afternoon when we visited, the lines for snacks were not long at all and even though a lot of people were there, the lobby never felt crowded. The lines were fast and we were in and out of the line within a few minutes. We get to our seats and they are nice. Take in mind this is a theater that you pick your seats. They recline almost all the way back but to the point where you are back but not hurting your neck to watch the movie. I think they are at the perfect angle. Not once did I hear sound from neighboring movies, which I hear at a lot of theaters. Out of most of the theaters my wife and I have been to in Charlotte, this one is at the top of our list. The down side is, it's in a busy area and on both occasions, we didn't watch the movie we went to see. On Friday, the next 2 showings were sold out and on Sunday the 2 showings we would see, they only had the front row available. You almost have to show up 2+ hours in advance to see more recent or popular movies. Another thing I like, this theaters has some classic and featured movies. I think that is an added bonus, since it gives more options to movie night. I would recommend this theater to anyone and I will be back for sure.",1
Just tried there food today it was amazing and  it's different from other Japanese food it's healthy your actually eating chicken that tastes like chicken and the service is great soon as you walk in its all smiles I will defnalty be back thank you,1
I think the A5 Breakfast Sandwich is my all time fave.  Definitely stop here if you're nearby in the morning.,1
One word!!awesome!!!! Love the recliner seats. They are super comfortable and cozy. It can be chilly in there so bring a blanket or wear a warm coat. I wish they would identify the entrance when picking seats. I always seem to pick the seats on the far end. The food is ok. The chicken and waffles were pretty good. Natchos were good. $2 hotdogs on tues free popcorn and $5 tickets!! Can't beat that!I like reserving my seat and paying with PayPal. Ticket kios's are easy to use. Nice bar and restaurant where you can watch ball games on their big screen. All in all my favorite theater.,1
Greg came promptly on time and tried every option on my a/c unit before giving me the actual problem.  He was able to fix the problem the same day within an hour. I  appreciate the honesty I received and speedy service. The pricing is fair.,1
I was referred to Red Seven by a friend when I was having issues with my laptop. I have since returned to them again and highly recommend them for any computer service you may need. The staff has been extremely patient and professional no matter what the question and the service has been timely and decent priced! I will likely consider purchasing from them if I need a replacement computer in the future.,1
"I had the French Dip and it was cooked very well.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the music.  The waitress ""Lisette"" was outstanding.  If you come to Fireside you need to ask for her.",1
"Talk about service, they went so far as to go next door to get celery for my crab dip appitizer. Thats great service.Oysters spicy. Mmmm mmmm goodGrest valueGreat service",1
"The best creperie in Montreal!!! This place is so cute, down a couple of steps looking towards the street. There are two tables and a counter along with a few seats up the window. The kitchen is open, so you can watch the owner make the crepes fresh each morning. It's so pleasant watching snow fall while listening to the crepes cook. They do have both sweet and savory ones and they are quite inexpensive. I got their strawberry crepe, which featured fresh strawberries and a little whipped crepe. The flavors were fantastic, not to sweet. We also had an egg and cheese crepe which was yummy and perfect for breakfast. Everything was so fresh and so perfect that even now, back in NY, I'm still craving them.",1
Love this place! Dirty Chai and Kitchen Sink salad are both a must!,1
This is the place to get your eyebrows threaded in the greater Phoenix area in my opinion. Tried a couple other places but there are too many inconsistencies with random people working there every time I go. The lady at MIS listened to what I wanted and did my brows perfectly. Also easy to find in the same p lot as Dutch bros.,1
"Just like a lot of places, I decided to try it out because I couldn't pick up a Vegas publication without reading something about this place!  I'm not sure what an Arepas was and how to pronounce it (nor do I even now!) but I can tell you it's wonderful!The location is right across from another gem of mine, Luv It Frozen Custard on Oakey and LV Blvd.  Not sure how packed this place can get, but parking could become a problem.  I visited Saturday afternoon and didn't have too many issues.So back to the food... I would describe an arepas as almost a Latin gyro sandwich.  Where you have a pita bread pocket stuffed with delicious meat.  You have several fillings to choose from, all of which are only $5!.  They also include a bottle of garlic sauce and hot sauce which helps add to the flavor of this pocket of tastiness.All I know is I'm coming back here this weekend.  Just like how I refuse to have fast food that is not In N out, I most likely won't go back to Taco Bell in Vegas ever again!",1
"ABC Hongkie here. Although their menu is far as extensive as your usual ""HK cafes"" , but the things on the menu are all quite good, at least the ones we ordered. HK milktea has some legit qualities. Prices are reasonable and good service. Would go back for sure",1
"I always get friendly service and the help I need when I go! There are two gals I always see they are Mara and Digna. They always help my family members who are under my plan and they always call when they need information for my policy and when they have offers for us or helpful information we might need. I was offered water and if I'm not helped right away, they check in on me and let me know how long it will be. They are also nice to offer calendars or accessories.",1
Cesar and his son did an amazing job! Thanks guys for the great service and TV mounting I will definitely use you again,1
So wonderful now that Bobby and Melissa took over! They turned into a wonderful and beautiful place. The last true honky tonk! And the food is great!,1
"This place, hidden away in a 1970s strip mall is a gem!! I loved the interior. It was bright, clean and inviting. The baristas were totally kind and accommodating to me as they could tell my need for caffeine was a few hours overdue. My posture straightened as they told me that the small, medium, and large all have 2 shots of espresso. Standard. I ordered a small latte. I could feel the caffeine boost after my second sip. By the time I got to my car, I was back to 100% functioning. Now, I just need to find someone to go back with me.",1
"The pistachio macaron was THE BEST thing I ate in Vegas.  And I was eating quite a bit.  Unbelievably intense in flavor.  You will not forget the taste.  I also had the eclaire and croissant, both good but average.  The macaroon was far better.",1
I don't have enough words to say what a great stylist Michelle is.  I have been going to her for at least four years.  I receive compliments on my hair continuously and I recommend Michelle and this salon to everyone I can.  I love that Michelle will give a real honest opinion as to what she thinks will and won't work for my hair. She takes pride in her work and won't let you walk out the door unhappy.  Do yourself a favor and go see her.,1
I want to give a BIG SHOUT OUT to  RENEE at the MAC PRO STORE in Cesar's Palace!! She is so knowledgeable in her profession and has a great bubbly personality. Renée made my shopping experience FABULOUS !!!!,1
This restaurant is a gift to your breakfast cravings. We went for a Friday brunch and still had to wait about 45mins but it was worth it. Maybe an off day as service was a little off (drinks took longer then food) but fortunately the food made up for that. I would definitely return and get the same meal,1
"This place was recommended by my beautiful date.  I must say it was perfect.  Service is amazing.  Food was very very good, and the mood was just right.  Piano playing in the bar really set the mood.  The overall experience was top notch.  Everyone there cares about what they do.",1
"Just had a great dinner with the hubby. Fabulous personal service from our waitress Danielle!! She suggested great choices for starters, dinner and dessert! We had lettuce wraps to start, a steak and shrimp soup for dinner. Finished it off with an amazing cheesecake! Yummy!!!",1
Very nice dr office service is very quick and the dr is straight to the point and knows what medicine to treat the concerned area of my skin.  DO NOT GO TO SPECTRUM DER DERMATOLOGY on camelback rd in phoenix.  They were rude as hell they said it was untreatable and wanted me to pay money. I recommend this doctor office,1
"Amazing service and dry cleaning for the price.  The owner takes it upon himself to learn his customers names and as you walk in the door your dry cleaning is waiting.  Yes, they do write your name in your clothes allowing them to easily identify your items.  I've been using their services for years.  If I have an item that may need to be redone, no questions ask (such as a crease in my pants) they will redo it.     You can pay 3x to 4x more at the other cleaners in Ahwatukee but it will be a waste of your time and money.",1
"Friendly service, showed us the best offer to get more for less money. pizza was great. I have my found my new go-to pizza place.",1
"Second best sandwich in town. The first two options are freaking delicious, never made it past those and usually get extra meat. Crunchy, saucy, juicy fried chicken how can you go wrong?",1
This is our third time using Rapid Blinds and Shutters. We keep coming back to add more because they are that great! Incredible service and shutters! Exceptional service from our initial visit with Dennis. He is always a pleasure to have on our home. He measures quickly and accurately. 6-8 weeks later we have our shutters installed. Again a lovely experience. They are fast and efficient and always clean up after themselves. Our shutters are absolutely gorgeous! Now our home is complete. Every window has a shutter from Rapid Blinds! Thanks again guys!,1
"This was my first ever spray tan. I bought a Groupon to try them out based on a friend's recommendation. They had a little video about what to expect on their website. The gal running the show was efficient, informative and polite. I think I may be hooked! I'll definitely be going back.",1
"Oh. My God.Special Kitfo. Get it Raw.Don't buy any crack outside, though.This place is a win.But I'm serious about the crack. It's cheaper up the street.",1
"Had lunch here today, and we absolutely LOVED it! The space has a bright, airy interior that is well suited to the delectable smells wafting from the big, open kitchen. I ordered a caramelized pineapple Margarita, and was very pleased that it wasn't too syrupy or sweet. The pineapple flavoring was just right, and the slight sprinkle of cinnamon on top was a nice touch.We shared the delicious calamari starter. I was reluctant to order the enchiladas suiza, but the preparation was lovely and different from anything I've had before. It's quite a large entree, btw. My boyfriend ordered the fajitas with grilled chicken marianated in tamarind sauce, and they were very tasty.",1
"We go to Scramble 3-4 times a month for breakfast because the food and service never disappoint us.We some times just stop in to get the jalapeño cornbread to go because it's so yummy, but, especially on a lazy Sunday morning, Scramble is a great place for breakfast or brunch.I really like the Toluca brizza, but my boyfriend prefers the Santa Fe Benedict.Because Scramble uses such fresh ingredients, EVERYTHING tastes great.The servers are very sweet and attentive, and the atmosphere is really homey.Scramble is our go-to spot for breakfast and brunch.  ENJOY!",1
Awesome show. Decent price. Interactive. Fun and family friendly. What more can ya ask for? Had a great time. Very talented musicians!,1
"This is by far the best plasma center I've been to. The staff is very friendly, prompt, and thorough. I'm usually in & out in less then 90 minutes. The facility is clean and spacious. I would recommend this place for sure.",1
"Not much to see from the outside but once you get in you are greeted by friendly staff in a clean and quaint restaurant. Our table had tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and ceviche, and all were fresh, delicious, and very good quality. Serving sizes were generous and a good value. 20 minutes from home but well worth the drive....we're definitely coming back!",1
"It was packed and it was 12:42pm when my boyfriend and I went to this Subway for some lunch!Although they were super busy, the staff was very friendly and very quick with our order. I'm a satisfied customer.",1
Loved it. So pleased. Get tickets cheaper at Vegas.comI've seen so many Vegas shows and this is in the top 3!,1
"The staff here is always friendly, courteous and efficient. Thank you so much for that. Plus the location is clean and always well stocked with all supplies. Restrooms are clean too. It is a pretty busy location however they are able to keep the line moving and people happy! So many great people here too many to name them all.",1
"I have found my new favorite veg friendly restaurant!  First off, everything is organic and as local as possible.  They don't have any mock meats, just pure food.  They have salads, wraps, soup, desserts, starters, and entrees.  Everything is vegetarian but can be made vegan, and a good portion of their items are raw.  They have a wide variety of loose leaf teas (can be ordered in a small or large press), they have healthy shooters (I love the Alkalize Now), elixers, house-made almond milk (tastes divine with the Vanilla Rooibos tea!!), iced tea and more.  As for the food, whoa mama! It's a culinary slam dunk in my opinion.  I have had several dishes here, including: The Rawvacado Wrap with the nut cheese substitute, the Nori Rolls (I drool), The Kaleidescope Salad (seeds, nuts, fresh herbs, kale, carrots, celery, lemon vinaigrette, side of bread), and let's not forget the amazingly vegan/raw desserts.  My favorite is the vanilla bean cheesecake! So good we had to order more!  This place is a tad pricey for some, but for the quality of food you're getting, think of it as a tiny investment towards good health.  The vibe is super chill and laid back and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  When the bill is presented, they even give you a small bowl of fennel seeds to ""help cleanse your palte and aid in digestion""!  Will definitely continue coming here for great, healthy food!",1
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - AND I'M PICKY!I recently rediscovered the pure joy of shooting. I needed to find a gun dealer near Scottsdale that I could rely upon and trust since I hadn't purchased any firearms since moving to Arizona in 1998.I visited at least 7 gun dealers in the Phoenix, Scottsdale and Mesa areas, and asked questions, checked prices, and read other peoples reviews and comments. I also test fired some guns that were available as rentals at local ranges. (A practice I recommend when possible).When it came time to buy, I chose Bear Arms in Scottsdale for the following reasons:1) They took the time to patiently answer all my questions & explain things2) There was no pressure to buy anything during my early store visits3) I found their recommendations to be honest and objective4) Their prices were excellent, and the most competitive I had seen anywhere5) They offered me an amount on a trade in that was in line with what another dealer had offered, but it was much higher than most dealers had offered - by a huge amount6) Their stock was very good, and in fact had 2 different guns in stock when I decided to buy7) They install accessories for the guns I bought there - for free8) Their inventory can't rivals the huge sportsman stores, but their carefully selected product mix makes up for it as they seem to have the quality items that people want9) They had ammo almost every time I needed it, at fair prices.Bottom line: Bear Arms has earned my trust and respect and while I will always do my homework before buying, I will continue to give them my business. Good folks there.ABOUT ME: For many decades I have owned several firearms for personal defense purposes. After moving here to Arizona in 1998, I got my CCW and have maintained it every since. Even with Arizona's right to carry, I am a strong advocate for continuing gun education and recurrent training in the safe handling of firearms and maintaining shooter proficiency. We all get rusty over time and continued ""refresher"" classes and regular field practice are a necessity. In my opinion.",1
"Really kind and attentive service. Quick, affordable battery change on 2 watches. I'd recommend his services.",1
"The Black Lab Stout is AWESOME! I like to pair it with the Black and Bleu Burger (with mushrooms added). The vibe here is always chill, the staff is knowledgeable and helpful, and the food is great. I would gladly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to eat away from the craziness of The Strip.",1
The Dollarita was awesome and our server Colleen was so nice and friendly. And the stir fry was amazing! My boyfriend loved his sandwich and my best friend loved his wings! The prices are so cheap and also Colleen put The Oscars on for me and I didn't even have to ask!,1
"Stumbled upon this gem last night and will be coming back many more times! Amazing service, surpassed only by their incredibly delicious creations. Friends and I split a special, a Hong Kong waffle with our choice of ice cream (we opted for Greg's roasted marshmallow and cookies and cream), graham crackers, chocolate sauce, and roasted marshmallows...which he brought out still lit on fire. MIND BLOWN!",1
"Wow. When you walk in your eyes can take in all the color and true amazement this store offers. Fossils, gem stones,crystals, geodes, jewelry art work, and 1 of kind eclectic items. They always have great sales in here. We bought several items and the prices were very good. The customer service was wonderful.",1
"hard to improve on this stay.  location was great for us..just remember to keep you east and west St Paul straight when getting there.  the staff, housekeeping,room and comfort level were outstanding.  small hotel with a cozy feel. contemporary style and fair price point.  capaccino, pastries and fruit available for no extra charge in the morning.  valet parking is 30 US dollars a day..a good value for that neck of the woods.",1
"Great food and drinks. It can be pricey especially if you're paying for your group/family but it's quality. We had the classics: the ""Our Burger"", fries and onion rings. We also had a Mud Pie adult frappe and a Peach Spiked Arnold that were really good. Watch out for the sodas, the go for about $5 each (crazy).",1
We order on-Line most Fridays. Love the thin crust Margarita. Order is always on time and perfectly cooked. Staff are friendly. A great experience.,1
"What a great time we had with the NLS team in Fij!!  Everything was ""as stated"" and better.  From registering for the trip, communication was consistent.  NLS kept everyone informed of any changes and information needed for the trip.  For example, it going on the village visit you'll need a skirt not pants for women, Fiji Air only allows a 15lb carry on bag, and other very useful intel.  Social gatherings before the trip were done to get everyone aquatinted before the trip.  Was nice knowing everyones name and something about them before getting the the resort.  Put a huge jumpstart to the week!!The Volivoli Beach resort is a fantastic resort.  Well beyond 5 Star IMO!  Service was top notch as well.  Everyone was greeted by name, everyday.  Facilities were clean and well maintained.  Views were awesome!!RA Divers delivered beyond expectation.  The the dive sites were clear and visibility is excellent.  DM's pointing out sharks, nudibranchs, turtles and other life from the area.  Even a short dolphin encounter with the boat.  Oh, another big one, their Jelly Fish don't sting!!Overall, NLS put together an awesome week of diving and looking forward to future dives with new friends.",1
Loved this spot for brunch! The ambiance is great. The building is gorgeous from the outside. We arrived right at 10am when the restaurant opened for brunch. Service was quick and our server was attentive. I had the Nutella pancakes and my boyfriend had smoked salmon eggs Benedict. We both enjoyed our meal!,1
"Their ""happy hour"" or as they call it ""recess"" is a great deal!Explore their cocktail menu or the extensive draft list! Either way you will be happy! Great hidden treasure in downtown Summerlin!",1
Melissa was excellent when I came in for my first hair cut at Salon 42. I told her I was referred by Nikki W and I received $10 off my service and a discount for Nikki on her next visit. I love that the wash station is built in to the individual stylist's station. I look forward to my next cut! If you go let them know Victoria Sneeringer referred you and receive $10 off!,1
Second time here and still impressed.  I had the veggie Benedict and he had the kings highway omelet again.  It most have been really good because he never orders the same thing twice anywhere else.  The veggie bennie was good but not as good as the omelet I had last time. Since I'm a creature of habit I'll probably get that again next time we're here.,1
The Cuban sandwich is maybe the best I've ever had. Surprising coming from an airport restaurant but very good.,1
"Every time I make a stop at Max Brenner's my heart goes pitter pat. And we're not talking about chocolate! I am a big fan of their food! The last couple years I would get the Asian Chicken salad, which was a sleeper hit recently removed from the menu (DOH!) so when I went in yesterday to find it gone I had to make some new decisions - omelet and side salad. This place does not disappoint. The lime vinaigrette salad dressing on the side salad was amazing and the ""no guilt"" omelet was fantastic as well. This place isn't just for choco-holics! Also, our server was fantastic. She was totally looking out for us and since my friend and I had colds she worked us up some hot toddies that weren't on the menu and came in a lovely presentation that helped us forget the sore throat on our Vegas trip. Three cheers for great servers.",1
The best donuts in Las Vegas.  Every time I'm in LV I enjoy my trip to the Donut Hut.  The chocolate long johns are unreal.  I have tried about 8 local shops but I always go back to the Hut!,1
"Fabulous food from scratch in a cozy, casual atmosphere. Don't forget to BYO and enjoy delicious, fresh food from chef Mark & Co. Highly recommend",1
Esther did a great job with my braids! I showed her the picture and she did exactly what I asked for. She was also very friendly and made the 8 hours pleasant. I will definitely be getting her to braid my hair again.,1
"We have been living in arizona about a year and a half now and can say by far the brickyard is our favorite bar and restaurant to go to. If it's just sitting at the bar watching  Mike Jordan Bobby etc mix amazing cocktails or just eating the most amazing flavorsome food, we always have a great time. The bar has great character and a lovely atmosphere and the team there go above and beyond in customer service. Happy to have had our wedding anniversary meal there today. Also excited for the owners new buisness venture in chandler more amazing food to try. Thank you brickyard team.",1
"WOW! NEVER A DULL MEAL! my favorite in Vegas. Service is spot on and the bartender was amazing, as well as the food!!! you can not go wrong with lago, Bar top, Patio or dining room its going to be a great meal no matter what.",1
Great hotel- here for work- great atmosphere and quality food! Rooms are nice. Sheets and pillows very comfortable and nice. The pool is good with a bar right outside. Closes at 6pm during the week but that's ok. Really enjoyed the ambiance and nice summer feel to it. Great service and food the whole time I was here. Harry's Place( which has a deal with check-in) also Mission Grille for lunch had loads of options. Healthy too! Walking distance from many great restaurants and shops,1
"I went in today for a oil change, super nice and honest people, I will definitely recommend them to everyone I know. They were very fast and reasonable priced!  They are gonna be my place to go when I need work on my Chevy. Nora was very sweet and friendly always smiling she knows how to treat her customers...and Chevy that drives a Ford was awesome, very true to heart with honesty... Great staff in general... Thank you for not trying to rip a lady off, I honestly appreciate it...",1
"DJ  was our server tonight and the food was amazing  and the service was better !!! My first time here and I absolutely loved it!!! DJ was super nice and helpful, the atmosphere was really nice and clean as well, I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely return!!!!!!",1
All I can say is om nom nom. I'm at this place once a week and it's hard to pull away from ordering the rare beef pho because I love it so.,1
"The brunch is so delicious, I had to go two weeks in a row! Each adult is $16 and worth every penny!Typically I steer clear of buffet lines at all cost, but Bistro la Bon is the rare exception. I found myself making multiple trips to try a little of every item they serve. They refill the dishes often so you get the freshest of all! Not everything is on the buffet line: the french toast, eggs, bacon, and chocolate waffles are made to order and brought directly to your table. Get the french toast...they melt in your mouth!You can find fabulous raisin scones (beware, if you are too overjoyed and squeeze them too hard they will burst all over you and draw attention in your direction), the apple pastry is oh-so-good, and the freshly grilled veggies are delightful. Pair the veggies with Swedish meatballs and the sausage and you've got yourself a healthy meal! I can go on and on!!Like others have noted, it's in the most unassuming place ever, but is completely a foodie's haven. Treat your tastebuds to brunch because you deserve the best!",1
The food is great! B fast is so good if your in a hurry too. The seating and the way they decorate the room is relaxing. I really like this place.,1
"C'est bon!  Reminds me of the croissants I used to buy in the patisserie next to my home in Brussels.  Fresh, flaky, REAL butter (not shortening).  The almond croissant and all their pastries are just as wonderful.  Wish I had the time to have breakfast there every day!!!",1
"This is my new favorite coffee shop. The workers are very attentive and the food is divine! I usually get a tea, but I think next time I'll try out some of there coffees. Highly recommend for anyone that calls themself a foodie or coffee snob!~ ;)",1
I came here a few weeks ago to get a tire when I had an unexpected flat.  I'm surprised that used tires are pretty cheap with some good thread on them still.  I paid 80 bucks for a 20 inch low profile tire. I'm back today to get to used tired for my 22 inch rims on my truck.  After looking through several tired I found two good ones with no cracks and good threads for 150 dollars for both.  One tire alone new is 200 dollars new.  That'll teach me to buy a used vehicle with huge rims on it again. Lol,1
It's a good clean healthy option when you have been bad all weekend in Vegas. I had the egg whites scrambled with turkey sausage. It was very good Shannon had the Greek scramble so loved it. And she dosent even like olives. Caleb had oatmeal big surprise there lol. Kyra had the multigrain protein pancakes. I had a couple of bites and though they were pretty tasty. Overall it was a good experience.,1
The best deals and taste at the same time we are definitely coming back again plus I love gambling here fun 21 is the shit here,1
"Ambiance: 3. Don't set the bar too high -- H 'n J is a dive restaurant just off the Las Vegas strip in Chinatown.  That said, the exposed brick, checked table clothes and local feel makes it a treat.Cost: 5. For once, we can all beat Vegas.  Even with a sub-$10 cab fare from the strip, H 'n J is still very affordable for what you get.  A pound each of crawfish, shrimp, and kind crab with sides and drinks did not top $60 with tip.  Meal would cost at least 2x that at the casinos, I almost don't want to share the secret for fear they jack the prices.Food Quality: 4. H 'n J serves its seafood in plastic bags they've mixed the seasonings in.  No plates, no rules -- it gets messy.  But it's so good, you don't care.  It was my first shelled crawfish experience -- quite tender, but a lot of work to open up their apparently smaller than average crawfishes.  Shrimp were good, king crab legs were AWESOME.  Lemon pepper and Hot 'n Juicy special seasoning were probably the two best choices to go with -- for heat lovers, go with at least medium spice for flavors.Service: 5. Waitress great, she walked us through the crawfish de-shelling process on arrival, as well as several menu questions on what to order, how much of it, and seasoning flavors.When to return: When you need to get off the Strip and the f out of dodge, a cheap but great seafood meal, when you're not looking to get lucky in the following 6 hours.",1
"I have been getting my car serviced here since 2011. The mechanics are always very friendly and professional. They are honest about what my car needs, and I never feel like they are fishing for extra work that is unnecessary for my car. Frank has helped me out for the past couple of services, and he takes the time to explain what services my car needs and why it needs them. I like that the mechanics check in on you while your waiting for the service and that they are accurate about how much time each service is going to take. The services are also easy to schedule, either by phone or online, and rescheduling is not an issue.",1
Steve is great! He was extremely professional and friendly. I had a few projects needed to be done and he took care of them without hesitation. I'll definitely be calling again if I have any future projects,1
We ordered take out from them and everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We had a twenty minute drive home after we picked it up and when we arrived home it was still incredibly hot. All of the staff was super friendly. Would highly recommend!,1
Great food and service!! Sandra our waiter was excellent! Our eggs benny was delicious! Thank you,1
"Me and Mariah, go back like...Oh the nostalgia, this concert brought back all the feels of my teenage years. The Colosseum at Caesars Palace is a smaller venue, so you can't really get a bad seat. The show started about 10 minutes behind schedule, which wasn't bad at all as far as concerts go. Her set consisted of a bunch of her #1 hits in order of release, so even if you're not a die hard Mariah fan, you'd probably recognize most of the songs. The stage had some props and background visuals that changed with each song, along with the band and some all male backup dancers. Mariah didn't do much physical performing other than walking the stage in really high-heels, some light interaction with her dancers, and getting carried or pushed across the stage. This did not bother me at all because I came to hear her sing and was NOT disappointed. They also had merch (expensive) available outside of the doors or in the gift shop next to the venue.",1
Burger was delicious (medium) flavorful in every bite. The staff very friendly and always on there feet. Wife got this dip which had chicken and ranch and buffalo sauce and was something i have never tried yet I'm going to try and make it at home. Will return forsure.,1
"Just simply amazing!I've been a weekly regular since my family and I discovered this place two years ago.  I have yet to be disappointed.  Believe me, I tried other places but they just don't compare.Good price, excellent quality.  Friendly and cozy atmosphere... what more can you ask for?  As for the owners... Sonny and Isan, you rock!",1
"This is my favorite place!!! Yummy, yummy, clean, courteous and delicious! Been coming here for years and it just keeps getting better! Can I give it 6 stars?",1
Excellent as usual! The Sunday Gravy is a top 5 appetizer of all time. As an entree choose the deep fried rabbit or scallops and you can't go wrong! Drinks are also exciting and delicious as well.,1
Great coffee..unpretentious..but great side orders..cheesecake or otherwise..been back several times.,1
"I haven't gotten out much recently to dine out, given current economic woes, but felt I had a good excuse to check out The Cove Trattoria to meet up with fellow Yelpers and Yelpettes. Service was prompt and courteous and the Happy Hour prices on drinks and food were a bit astonishing.As for the food, I decided to treat myself to seafood and ordered two of the ""small plates"" which included the Shrimp Verde and the Mussels. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned on a skewer with a side of reconstituted sun dried tomatoes. Delicious! I shared a few with my Yelp neighbors and then greedily kept the rest to myself. The mussels were amazing, especially the slightly chunky rich garlicky broth that begged to be soaked up and scooped with the accompanying toast points.Between the two small plates, I had enough to share with other people and fill myself with seafoody goodness. Beers (Stella Artois, for me) were only $2.50 a pop according to Happy Hour pricing. I tipped generously and then was reminded that gratuity was included (since we were dining as a group). Nonetheless, I didn't retract my original tip because the food was so delicious and affordable.Their Happy Hour here has to be one of the best-kept bargain secrets around. I will definitely be back to ""treat"" myself sometime soon.",1
Food was absolutely fantastic.  On par with many of the great restaurants in Las Vegas.  The service was incredibly personable and the chef even came to check on our dining experience (during the soft opening).,1
"Lucky to have found a good Peruvian restaurant. I have always enjoyed their food, and this is a good place if you enjoy Peruvian food as well. My friend got the Lomo Saltado and I got the Pollo with the orange sauce that I do not remember the name. I also got the Maracuya juice (asked not to be made with sugar and they were nice to do so) juice was not watery, it was really good. Food had awesome flavors and presentation. Aji seemed to be made with rocoto (aji, which translates to chili for those just used to that word) which was amazingly flavorful. The service was nice. Only thing I did not like too much was that the tables are a little too small, and I felt I had to arrange plate, sauce, glass and other items in a perfect way so I can eat comfortably. Also, difficult to park in the front and I am not sure if parking is allowed by the liquor store next door. Overall really good! I recommend it!",1
First time to Phoenix and I came to this joint and I do not regret it at all. The service was quick. You order at the bar and have a seat and they will bring out your food. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and it came with a side of rice and beans. This was the THE BEST enchilada I have ever had.,1
Always friendly and quick service.  Busy store but they don't make you feel rushed at cashier. and they help you pack your bag.,1
"Super delicious and fresh and I ordered through Uber eats the hot was hot, the cold was cold and so worth the money I will definitely go back or order again! Thank you for being on point well done",1
"I've always had a fear of going to the dentist and procrastination got the best of me when I finally decided, after too many years, to finally see the dentist. I choose Dr. Balle's office because it was close to home and had some good ratings (dentists don't seem to get reviewed very often). Long story short, the staff is very friendly, they'll do anything they can to make you feel good about your experience, I felt at ease, Dr. Balle was great and Sarah, the hygienist made me actually feel good about returning, which has never happened anywhere else.Even if I moved to another part of town, I would still make the trip to this office because of the super friendly and caring staff.... not easy to find in a dentists office.",1
We were in town for a softball tournament and had a flat tire. Got it pimped up at the field and drove to the tire shop and they were very helpful. One tire and valve stem replaced.... out the door in 25 minutes and only cost &60.00 great service and very friendly!!!!!!,1
Omg!!! The most flavorful mexican restaurant I've have found her in the Las Vegas valley.It's authentic Mexican food. Especially coming from East Los Angeles where you have several fantastic Mexican restaurants this one is just as great. Highly recommend this restaurant. The seafood molcajete was excellent and their home made sangria iwas excellent.,1
Amazing food & atmosphere! Highly recommend to anyone!!!! Rachael was our server & she was great!!!!,1
I've been here 3 times now and Roberto is great! My style of haircut isn't easy and he knows exactly what he is doing. You can tell he takes pride in what he does.,1
"Forest is the best!  I love this salon and she has an amazing skill doing color.  Very comfortable salon, she is very timely and great at cuts and color!",1
So sad to see this brewery go but I genuinely enjoyed spending their last night being open there. Staff was extremely friendly and the beers (the ones they did still have on tap) where really good.,1
"I've been here at least ten times for a dip powder manicure, and they never disappoint! First of all, I don't ever request a nail tech because I've had my nails done by multiple people and they've all been great! Secondly, they have the largest variety of dip powder colors I've ever seen and to make it even better they put all the shades of one color on individual rings to make it easier. I will definitely keep coming here.",1
Phat Phranks is the best hidden jewel in Las Vegas.  The Mama Maria's Enchiladas are amazing and the staff makes you feel like you are eating at their Kitchen Table!,1
The service is great and the food is even better. Doesn't need much more explaining than that!,1
"My wife and I saw this show last night and it was great!!!  The woman are beautiful the mc is hilarious and the lead singer Lorena (not Bobbit) has an amazing voice. Last nights show was military appreciation night. I am not in the military but 100% support our troops. Lorena's rendition of Oh Beautiful gave me chills!!!  I asked my wife, out of all the girls, which one could she not take her eyes off of and we both had the same answer Mariah. She was simply stunning!!!  Don't get me wrong, they are all beautiful, she just had something about her that was mesmerizing. Wanted to get a pic with her but didn't get the chance after the show . If you are in town and want to see a fun, hot show, this is the one!!    One last thing to say, though we couldn't take our eyes off Mariah the act that stole the show was the silk curtain performance. I am so sorry I don't remember the woman's name who did it, as she deserves recognition, but she was amazing and very talented.   All around great show!!!  We will see it again and get seats in the front row. That's the place to be if you are a couple.",1
"Not many places great you with the best granola you've ever had. Crêpe Bar is a delicious experience that I recommend to everyone! I ate the savory curried vegetable crêpe and had Heart roasters Kenya Githiga in pour over. The Crêpe FAR exceeded my expectations. The taste was well balanced and the way they plated it was beautiful. The coffee here is by far the best drip and pour over coffee I've had at a restaurant. On top of the great service, they caught wind that my lady and I are coffee enthusiasts and brought over an amazing sample dish of their seasonal cold brew (steeped with rose) and their oak barrel conditioned cold brew for us to try! The staff are knowledgable, friendly, and outgoing. The atmosphere is great, and the food superb. 5 stars from me!",1
Tony has some of the best guys working for him. Their customer service is top notch and I will not be going anywhere else for my oil changes or repairs. Today I received an oil change and new brakes. I used their courtesy shuttle service to my home and back and requesting that with them was so easy and Troy was kind and very easy to talk to. The total came out to be less than they had originally quoted and when I looked at the bill they had added a discount without me asking!,1
Im in town from DC for a couple of days. Not sure if my wife or I hit something on the Hwy coming to Charlotte. Came to RGX hoping to get in on a booked day. Front Desk Rep made some magic happen and squeezed me in to fix a crack in the wheel. NOW that's good costumer Service!!,1
My husband and I had the most delishous meal tonight! I had the spicy ramen and he had the deluxe poke bowl and both were phenomenal.  Best ramen I've ever had!!! Staff was attentive and didn't miss a beat.,1
"The staff here are super friendly and are ready to answer any questions you might have. They also have an excellent selection of games from systems that are both old and modern. They also have an excellent selection of LEGO. If you have a kid who likes LEGO but you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a handful of pieces, come here for large misc bags for $20 or a pick-n-mix selection starting at something like $5 for a salad bowl container. Great value.",1
"Madison has been cutting my hair since 2011, and I would never trust another hairdresser with my hair.  Madison is personable, professional, and steadfast in her work.  I have recently taken my mom to Madison for a hair cut.  We are both highly satisfied with the quality of Madison's work.",1
This is a very nice country style restaurant located in Peoria Az.  They offer great country food with great service and a awesome ambiance.  We enjoyed some amazing Bloody's from Laura and then followed that with some chili and two great entree's.  The Buffalo burger and the beef enchiladas with pork chili on top were great!Victoria and Laura took very good care of us and answered all our questions.  We will be back soo for more as there were about 20 things on the menu that I have to try.,1
Very clean place with the best flavors and toppings! The acai bowls are my favorite and the best price for them in town!  The staff is always pleasant.,1
Ordered takeout on New Year's Eve for my wife and I and we both loved the food. We ordered two meals and that was more than enough for the two of us and we had some left over for the next day. The vegetable lo mein was delicious and the orange chicken tasted extremely fresh. The staff was extremely friendly and delivered great service. We will definitely be going back.,1
"This is a great place for breakfast.   Seating is limited. So expect a little wait.    The sausage, bacon, hash, pancakes were all great!   Their homemade hot sauce is really good -- definitely give this place a try.  The cinnamon butter on the pancakes was really good too.",1
Addicted! Must have once a week at least! Never had anything not great from here ever! And the people whom work here are nothing but phenomenal! Dine in or delivered....they are all awesome people!,1
"I've found Perfect Hair and Makeup on Yelp and booked the services two weeks in advance. I can't say enough how thankful I am to Irina and Julietta for their amazing job! They came to my hotel room in time and did my hair and makeup the way I wanted without lengthy explanations. My makeup looked very natural and I absolutely loved it. If you're looking for a fairly priced professional service, this is a place to call.",1
"Have never been to a place like Sorso before and I have to say, I thought it was really cool! The atmosphere was really nice. I went for happy hour on a Friday and was glad that it wasn't overly busy. One thing that I thought was interesting and unique was that they had iPads as the menus! I had not seen something like that before and I thought it was neat. They had a good wine selection too, and a bunch of them were on the happy hour deal, two glasses for the price of one. Thought that was a great HH deal! The server was super nice too, helped us figure out how everything worked and such. Overall cool experience here, I will be back!",1
This used to be mcdougal eye center but the name changed and now it's southwestern. The reason they don't have any appointments for a month out is because so many people love this place and swear by it. Everyone there is great but especially max. He even gave me his personal cellphone number so I could text him a picture of frames I wanted him to order for me. He went above and beyond to search and find the frames for me. I've been going here several years and love this place. Call and ask for max!!!,1
Definitely a favorite for us!  Great food that rotates new items in to keep the menu different.  The beer selection has a good mixture of brews that aren't just local.  You gotta visit when in Old Town.,1
"Great food and customer serviceWent to get some pastries and got the great aspargus spinach leek soup, and a cafe mocha too.  Very nice employees, carried my food to my table so I wouldn't spill it.Love that soup and the pastries are always great...",1
"After 10 years in the military when making the transition to the corporate world I had no idea where to start in buying a suit. After spending way too long on-line reading every article or forum I could find, I stumbled across someone raving about Men's Apparel Club. After checking out the reviews on Yelp I was confident I had the right place and made an appointment to see Barry. The guy was fantastic. Knew exactly what I needed, and explained everything as he helped me to put together a couple great looking suits. I had my wife with me and he asked her opinion on everything, from suit color to ties, he made sure she was just as happy with it as I was. I walked out of Men's Apparel Club feeling like a million bucks and wont be buying a suit from anywhere else from now on. If you need a new suit, Barry is the man to see.",1
My husband and i really like this target because of the great customer service we get from Tyler. I only wish the store was bigger so we could get more merchandise,1
Went here for breakfast one day with my fiancé just to try something new and let me tell you this was the best breakfast I've ever had. I decided to go with the breakfast quesadilla and it was fantastic. If you ever close by this place go in and try it because it will not disappoint!,1
"Absolute gem. I am always looking for breakfast and I ordered a pork omelet at 3 PM with an extra egg, mushrooms and onions. Massive portions with tons of pork. Eggs , onions and mushrooms grilled up perfectly and the pork was moist and flavorful.  Employees are are all really cool and friendly. Cost less than $6. Incredible. I'd eat here all the time if I lived in Cleveland.",1
I went to the salon for a cut and style. I was hesitant at first but Susie was absolutely fantastic. Her knowledge gave me the comfort I needed to try something new and I was definitely satisfied - not only with my new hair style but with the service I received. It's so hard to find a good hairstylist that you can trust and im happy I finally found a place I can go to over and over again. I highly recommend Susie for all of your hairstyling needs!,1
"I came to see Dr. Cambeiro based on a recommendation from a friend of mine.  She had the highest of praise to give him and loved his work.  Upon first meeting Dr. Cambeiro and his entire team, it was clear to me that he was the perfect doctor for me.  I like that he is honest and straight forward in his conversation.  When shopping for a plastic surgeon, the best deal is not the answer; the best doctor is.  You can tell from Dr. Cambeiro's demeanor that he is an expert and knows what he is talking about.  I wanted a surgeon with confidence that could fix my issues and give me a level of comfort that everything would go as planned.  I could not be happier with my results. Everyone in the office had been amazing for all my follow up visits.  I am so glad I made the right choice, and would highly recommend Dr. Cambeiro to everyone!",1
"I've been a customer for years, purchasing camera bags, lens caps and other accessories, photo printing and even passport photos. Every time I walk in the door, I'm greeted by a friendly, competent professional who is eager to assist. If I were in the market for a camera, this is the first place I'd visit.I want to share my experience with passport photos. I travel globally for my job, so it always seems I need a visa photo. I had horrible experiences at local pharmacies with various photos of this type, so when it came time to renew my passport, I wanted a photo I wouldn't be horrified to look at for the next 10 years.The Camera Company has a white screen and professional lighting and the photo is taken with a quality camera by a person who genuinely wants to take a nice photo of you. (I can't tell you how many times the cashier at the local pharmacy took my photo with the lens two inches from my nose, resulting in a visa photo where my facial features were distorted. I even politely asked once that she take a few steps back and use her editing software to create the final product, but, alas, she refused, citing they have training for this and it's how they do it. Ugh.)If you find yourself in need of a passport or visa photo, please do yourself and the customs and immigration staff a favor and have a decent photo taken at The Camera Company. It won't cost you any more, and you'll be pleased with the result.",1
"We loved 100 Fires! It's a little cafe located right on the lake. Beautiful views on the outdoor patio! Atmosphere is casual and relaxing. Our server Daniel (who is also a manager/partner) was extremely friendly and helpful. His recommendations were spot on. We shared three types of empanadas, jerk chicken, Benny sliders, and tried both the flan and raspberry sorbet for dessert. Everything was so delicious! Very flavorful, authentic food with Cuban and Caribbean influences. You could tell the ingredients were fresh and that a great deal of care was put into each item. Not only was the food delicious, but it was also very affordable! We are eager to try more of the menu. We were there in the evening but would like to come back for breakfast as they had many breakfast items on the menu, including several coffee options and smoothies. Overall we had a fantastic experience at 100 Fires! We will definitely be back. Can't wait for our next visit!",1
"Absolutely amazing. We shared a simple grilled whitefish among 6 of us and it was probably the best fish I have ever had. The signature appetizers, Greek salad, and grilled veggies were equally delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"My wife and I used Tommy twice while visiting Cleveland.  A trip from the airport to downtown, and a two-hour tour of Cleveland.  Both very enjoyable.  After reading earlier reviews, maybe Tommy gets upset when customers are late.  I can't blame him.  We take appointments seriously, and I guess Tommy does too.  (He was not just on time but a little early for both of our appointments.)",1
The food was really good especially the twice baked hot wings. But the reason I'm taking the time to write this review is because our server was amazing.  I've eaten here several times but this time Dresden our server made it an extraordinary experience. She made sure that  all of my food would be safe for me dietary restrictions. I highly recommend you go visit this location and ask to be seated with her. I will definitely be back.,1
I just stumbled on this place and it was perfect.   I needed to get in and out within an hour.  I got a pedi and mani within the hour.  They were kind and sweet and did a beautiful job.,1
"This course has the best greens in the valley!  I just played in the middle of July and could not believe how soft the greens were!  I was actually making ball marks and sticking my shots, something I haven't done playing in Arizona since March.  Also, I am a terrible putter, but I putt better on these greens than anywhere, they must be doing something right.",1
Best Ever!!! Always stop by when I'm in the neighborhood.   Btw they do a buffet the first Friday of every month!,1
Awesome place they made a custom LV cake for my wife's birthday not only did it look good but taste awesome.,1
"This Company Rocks !Thank you so much Omar and staff for being so Honest and Trustworthy!I had recently bought all new tires at Costco, and after 3 weeks got a nail in one of the tires while I was visiting Las Vegas for the weekend.  I purchased the tires using a friend's Costco card that was with me at the time of purchase, but the day I got the flat, I did not have access to his Costco card, so Costco turned me away.   I went to Bruce Scher's Goodyear Tire company to have them check my tire out, because I was getting a low tire pressure reading on my car's dashboard, and these guys took me right in and patched my tire for FREE !    I am a SOLD customer - and can not say enough good things about this Automotive/Tire Shop.    I am a customer for Life !Thanks guys -- I am referring you to Family and Friends forever!!!",1
"This is my favorite ramen restaurant , it's so supper delicious , try all the broth & it's all good. The staff supper nice, there is no wait like the other ramen restaurant . It's kinda hidden but I'm glad I found it",1
We had great service and our fresh crawfish hit the spot and satisfied our craving that we've been having! Wings and fries were also really delicious too. So glad there is one here near our hotel!,1
"Ever since I noticed the closure of K & K Cafe that previously occupied this space which the current Surely Up Vegetarian Hotpot (素上簽) took over, I was curious about its food and dining experience (but not before mourning a bit about my previously favourite go-to HK style cafe)... but I digress.I had heard that Surely Up Vegetarian Hotpot had a conveyor belt which served the toppings for the hot pot portion of the meal.  I was very curious to see how it would be like because not only was this the very first vegetarian hot pot restaurant I had dined in but a conveyor belt one at that! Surely Up Vegetarian Hotpot is located at Jubilee Square at Valleymede and Highway 7 (there's a McDonald's and Omei Chinese restaurant in the plaza too).My mom and I arrived right at 11 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  To no one's surprise, we were the very first ones here.  We were able to select any seat of our choosing.  There were two staff members and they were getting ready to start the day as we could see.  Inside the kitchen, another staff member was preparing the toppings and ingredients for the hot pot and nothing was out on the conveyor belt yet.The female server handed us a single laminated menu and from that, we selected two hot pots with a base soup and placed our order.  However, a few minutes later when another party of two arrived, I noticed that the male server gave them a second separate menu in addition to the one we received from which there were more choices.I called the female server over and immediately exclaimed about the lack of the second menu upon which she did provide to us.  We also retracted our order since we were given the full menu to peruse now.  I mean... that's not fair to the customer to only receive one menu when there are in fact two to choose from.  It makes the dining experience entirely different!Thus, we decided to choose the lunch menu which included a House Special Combo with three toppings chosen from the conveyor belt with an additional rice or sweet potato verimicelli.[Essentially, the cost is per soup base ($5) and then per plate of toppings ($2, $3, or $5).  The lunch combo we ordered is $11.99 that includes one soup base and three plates of your choice off the conveyor belt plus noodles or rice.]We also ordered the $5 soup base menu (I chose the soybean soupbase).  Any toppings chosen from the conveyor belt would be charged separately.By this point, the kitchen had prepared lots of toppings and each dish was slowly being placed on to the conveyor belt and being rolled out.  It was adorable and I had to take videos of this.I liked how each dish was placed on a specified spot where there was a coloured-coded sticker that showed its name in English and Chinese as well as the price of the plate.Our two stockpots of soupbases (Original Wild Mushroom Stockpot and Soybean) arrived not long after.  It's a flat type of stove top where you can adjust the intensity of the heat in three settings.  I found that my soybean soupbase easily overflowed with the highest setting, so I had to monitor it frequently.There was a do-it-yourself station for sauces just like at other hot pot restaurants.We picked various toppings from the conveyor belt to enjoy (three of which were included with the lunch combo).  I enjoyed the experience and I definitely enjoyed my soybean soup base.  I liked how (when compared to other hot pot restaurants) I felt comfortable drinking all of the soupbase since it seemed healthier and didn't seem to contain any MSG.  It was a very satisfying meal and the price was moderate for lunch considering it was more of a premium experience.I liked that their TV screen showed some vegetarian-focused cooking and dining documentaries.  It would be nice to go there just to pig out again on vegetarian eats while watching those shows. For hygiene purposes, they used either plastic wrap or transparent plastic covers to shield the rotating plates from exposure to the air.  Using reusable plastic covers is a great idea; the disposable plastic wrap not so much.  So much of it is discarded after just one use...If you share a photo on social media, you receive 10% off their regular items!If you are vegetarian or know someone who is, this is definitely a great place to check out for lunch or dinner.  There were a lot more customers in the restaurant afterwards too.  (Surely Up also has vegan options if you inquire about it.)",1
Hands down the best dental office anywhere!!  I've been going here since they moved to Matthews.  They do the best work and are very gentle and so thorough in explaining.  The staff is very professional and kind!!,1
"I have frequented this location many times, the ambiance is great, the staff is professional and the food is always amazing! The Ahi Tuna is always fresh and a great starter! The top sirloin is loaded with flavour. Those mushrooms, wow, better than magic mushrooms! A trip is never complete without a billy miner pie, packed with more deliciousness than 31 flavours! Side note: the ribs are good, but if you're going to the Keg don't not order a steak, you'll just look on in envy when everyone is eating that sweet juicy meat.",1
Corena is Great! She caters to you and let's you decide what you want for your hair ! I was happy to go in and have exactly what I wanted done. Thank you !!,1
"How could we go to Vegas every couple of months and not have known about this place? I found a review by a feller Yelper and she gave it 5 stars and considering she likes places that I also like in Vegas I knew it would be great!Came here with high expectations, the servers are all in tuxedos and are very professional. We were seated shortly after checking in for our reservation. This place is like a Michelin star rated restaurant.We ordered a lot of different items to try, the server made great recommendations and we went with them. We even tried the steak to see how well they do that.Seafood was fresh, delicious, and the items that were cooked were perfect in every way. Steak was on par with a Ruth Chris or Flemings, we were very impressed.We wanted to try almost all of the desserts so we ordered half slices knowing we won't have too much wasted food.From beginning to end the meal was fabulous, loved the server checking up on us ever 5 minutes or so.Can't wait to go back and try some their crab legs as they said they are famous for that as well.Can't go wrong here with anything.",1
Love this place. Awesome sushi hour during the weekdays. I'm a regular and have never been disappointed in my 7 years of coming here.,1
"We have been talking about going here for a couple years and finally went. The atmosphere was very welcoming and pleasant. Unfortunately, it was raining and we couldn't sit on the patio. The wine selection for us white wine drinkers was broad. The Lunatic White Blend satisfied this usual Riesling drinker and my wife had a delicious German Riesling. To complement the wine we had a nice antipasto plate. We will be making ourselves regulars here. Especially when we move within walking distance.",1
"Very good.  Prices reasonable.  May have hair in my food from kitchen, but may have been from me....",1
Once a market with a small cafe but then they realized that they could be both market and kick ass bar/restaurant. We rocked out a bottle of Greek rose. Followed it with a juicy burger and baked fried potato nuggets highlighted by a fresh and creamy Tzatziki sauce. The wife had scallops with mashers. I can never get enough of sea scallops. Pier W started my love of them and Astoria picked up right where the dubs had left off. Well done and good on you Astoria chefs. Timmy was a delightful bartender guiding us through the menu with precision and knowledge. An adorable smile too. I heard his softball team calls him 'sunshine' because of his long hippy hair and athletic prowess. Will definitely revisit. Gordon Square is getting sneaky good with food lately. Check out Ninja City review next!,1
"Go see this show!!! Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! Totally worth going! I actually thought it was going to be super cheesy but boy was I wrong!!! It was funny, entertaining and absolutely mind blowing. I have to say the Gaucho Brothers were super hilarious and had my Husband and I rolling on the floor laughing. My 6 year old boy was laughing a lot too. Wally Eastwood  the Host was definitely very entertaining too!!! Basically this show is a variety of acts from juggling to music to dancing and magic it has it ALL!!! Every single act here was perfect,  the finale had me like wowwww. I was so mesmerized of how hot the male and female were so beautiful, their soft skin and rock hard sexy ass bodies. Got me like whoaaaaa!!! Not to mention they were extremely talented too. Hard to say which act was my favorite the Magic show was pretty awesome too. We all loved this show so much, we got some great seats and had a fantastic time here.After the show the performers come out for a meet and greet. Would definitely recommend this show! 5 stars all the way!",1
"I can't say enough about Dr. Donna and her staff.  Professional, friendly and they really care.  I never used a Chiropractor in my almost 50 years on this earth, but I'll never go without her again.  She is able to give me relief with a few visits. I have lower back pain and occasional neck pain and she can get me back to my best self.  I feel blessed to have found these folks and an outlet of pain relief.",1
"I come here all the time! The food is delicious, and the decor is so cute. They make good drinks, too. I highly recommend their pulled pork, and their french fries will change your life. Yay for delicious tropical goodness!",1
"The bomb. Foodies, add this one to your list !Park has some of the freshest, most delicious sashimi I have never had. The fish melted in my mouth. Treat yourself to their 5-course tasting menu which will include sashimi, but also great dishes such as an asian noodle soup, poached lobster and seared fish. An absolute must.",1
When you order pizzaiolo you should also call the police cause you're going to get raped. I paid $40!!! And the toppings were stingy. This pizza was supposed to have bacon. I ate 3 slices with one piece of fatty bacon.,0
"We met some friends at Maggiano's for lunch today, the restaurant was not busy, we were greeted very professionally, seated and introduced to our server.   The service was just OK, and we had to ask for straws and more water a couple of times.   My wife ordered the eggplant parmesan and I ordered a lunch special which included a soup and a chicken parmesan sandwich.My wife eggplant parmesan was not very good and my chicken parmesan sandwich was not edible.   The chicken must have been a pre-prepared frozen product the restaurant bought from a food supplier.Considering this restaurant is considered a higher end restaurant our menu choices we very sub par.   I would suggest the chef, if there actually is one, take the chicken parmesan off the menu until they can get it right.   Better yet, I suggest the chef attempt to eat that menu choice and see if they can finish it.We will not be recommending Maggiano's to anyone nor will we ever eat at this establishment again.MGrady",0
"I was having a fantastic time here at XS, but AJ at the blackjack tables ruined my night. My friends and I were having a great time and enjoying the atmosphere and he made us feel uncomfortable and inadequate. I hope that he is somehow disciplined for this behavior. Dealers are FANTASTIC!! He needs removed from whatever position he is in.",0
"This place has been so hit-or-miss lately that I am done with it. Recently, I was served the worst Bloody I have ever had (they use a mix that contains high fructose corn syrup and MSG... and this is a cocktail place?!), got into a heated discussion with a male patron only to have the bartender chime in and start yelling at me. Recently, have been repeatedly been surprised with imagery of women being abused on the television at the end of the bar. They really should stick to kung fu movies and old sci-fi...Over it.",0
"I already thought this place was overpriced and over hyped.. but this last time was the tie breaker. I came in with a girlfriend right before happy hour ended and all they had available was the ""community"" table which was by the restrooms and had 10 high top seats. After an hour of many overpriced margs and food, the hostess came up to us and told us to leave and to move outside. We all had full drinks we just reordered and had not paid our bills. It was 8:02. And the hostess told us the 8:15 reservation was here for this table so we had to move. I have never in my life been asked to be moved to a new table because a reservation was here early. We asked for the manager and all she said was that we could be moved to the bar tops when there was still a booth available inside. We will never be going back here and will tell all of our friends to never go here either. Worst customer service I've ever heard of in my life, and I've been in the industry my whole life.",0
Horrible experience!  They do NOT clean vehicles in the order of arrival. Drive fast past this car wash.,0
"Not worth the price! Don't move in here! 1) it was called ""Grigio"" when we moved in. We were promised a new Apple Watch if we signed a lease before Feb (which we did). 3 months into our lease and still no watch. I confronted them and they said its only if you MOVE IN by that day (which we did too)! Then they said oh, it was a raffle. Bull shit! I was promised a watch for signing a lease and never received it! I asked around and no one received their watch!! 2) we have been here 6 months (moved the beginning of winter) and the pool is never heated! We have to make A maintenance request every day and it's fixed for a day or two then off again! We were promised a heated pool and that never happened!! I think they are just cheap and don't want to pay the cost to heat the pool!!! Oh and a COLD jacuzzi! 3) they said the NEW updated gym would be finished in March (big reason I moved in was for the nice game) and it's already June, they said they won't even be starting until next year)! They lie about everything just to get you to move in. Most of the treadmills randomly shut off so I ended up having to pay a membership somewhere else just to do my full cardio!! 4) maintenance is quick to fix our repairs (inside apt) but they don't fix anything else! The property is let go. Most of the doors you have to kick or slam open because they are always stuck and only one grill works!! The pool is NEVER heated and the jacuzzi is always COLD!! Cold???5) read your lease in full before signing! They will evict you for anything..... I called the cops because someone pulled a knife on me and in our lease is says if any cops are called to the apt for ANY reason, you get evicted and pay all legal fees!! I'm sorry I called to protect myself!!! I had to pay $500 in court fees, lost my home, AND all deposits I paid here!!!! Also, when you get evicted from here, they get an order for you to never come on the property again (or you go to jail for trespassing). I think the real reason they evicted me is because I always complained to fix the pool/gym/doors and mad about my watch I never got!!!!!",0
"I just left the Starbucks on Green Valley and Warm Springs. Asking for one item that you sell.  Bought it there several times. He was so rude and disrespectful to me, this gentleman had his hair up in a very small ponytail. He was not representation for your store or company.  I will never step foot in that store again. You should Not be in any type of customer service ?Thank you for your quick attention to this matter, happy holidays",0
"When my beloved Texas Longhorns were playing the Mobilehoma Sooners a few years back, the press had decided that OU would beat my team.  As victory was apparent for the Longhorns in the 4th quarter, those of us in the burnt orange and white were able to cheer ""OVERRATED.....OVERRATED"".  That is pretty much what I want to do every time I walk into the Hard Rock.  I enjoy partying in Vegas just as much as the next person, but everytime I go to the Hard Rock, it gets a little more thuggish and a little less tolerable.  Last time I played craps, I was the only one playing while everyone else was playing the Field.  Ugh, nothing worse than Field betters.  Anyway, for my trendy, fun, young hotel experience, I would pick the Palms anyday.  We are officially finished with the Hard Rock.",0

I am under strict federal guidelines for rest periods and leaving very early evening hours, this is federal requirement and for the safety of my passengers to ensure I don't get in an accident. The manager has put the hire at fault if anything happens. This action was inappropriate. It's been another 45 minutes now and no room this far.",0

The Whoppers my friend and I got were both burnt to a crisp. Both the meat and the buns were blackened. The fries tasted very strange, and were not hot at all.  Never again.",0
Terrible. The service was good as far as our waiter's concern but the food was nasty. Very bland!!! Only thing I enjoyed were the fruits. Even my coca cola tasted weird like it was diet. We went for lunch and it was $15 each to get in. Robbery!! If I'm going to pay $15 the food should be tasty.,0
"I purchased a massage here through Groupon yesterday and originally schedule my appointment for 5 days from now. Something came up and I asked to switch to today, the day after I bought the Groupon. I received a text back saying they had 12:00 Friday available. I even double checked that it was today they were referring to and not the next Friday and it was. I showed up at 12 on the dot today for my massage and the receptionist told me to have a seat someone one would be out to get me. No one came to get me and another employee in the salon told me they were pretty sure she just took another person back for a massage. So I waited 15 minutes just to be sure there wasn't confusion about what was going on and then I left. I sent a text letting her know I was there and waited but that I had left. She finally responded:I had to assist gary he booked yesterday. You have to book in advance.1st come 1st serveBook early next time!I have to keep going because people have to go work.I gotta pick up my child at 2pm everyday so i never have 2pm open.I do not have any other person waited for me. She waited for ratana. Not me.To which I responded that she chose that time slot, not me and she never came out. Then she said:I am not employed at Baroque spa. I am independent contracter massage tgerapist who rent this room so...My reply was:I work too. As a matter of fact I worked until 5am and woke up early specifically for this massage and didn't even get the courtesy of a few minute window. And all she had to say was:I see. I recommend you book early like everyoneI think this is HORRIBLE customer service and warn people not to go here.  I have never run into a situation like this. This was unbelievable, that an independent contractor who's business does better with word of mouth would treat a potential returning client as such.",0
"Lordy, Lordy where do I start??!!?? Location: ok people if this is a rough part of town then I must live in the ghetto. Now grant it I did pass 3 local motorcycle guys whose club house is just down the street but when they are 70 years old and riding trikes I'm not getting scared. The area is just like any commercial area and decentClub: let the fun begin, we'll maybe not. I sat in the parking lot for 20 minutes with a very open mind. I counted 38 cars in the parking lot and the periphery. Can someone say paaaarrrtaaaay?? No , no one. Ok. Well anyway I saw a Paris Hilton look alike exit the building to smoke. Very hot, dressed conservatively with a sweater and dark sunglasses. I jumped out of the car and by the time I got to PH for my hug she had smoked 5 hits of crack and had been through 30 rounds of the UFC. She reached out to hug me and the stinch almost knocked me over. She had just 1 lonely tooth hanging on by dried saliva and her beautiful blonde hair was actually a smoke drenched yellow wig. She weighed a hefty 80 lbs and scared me to death. I almost ran but my $40 wanted to exit my pocket so I entered the doors and handed it over. I got a nifty armband incase I became retarded and wanted to return later. A hefty girl in glasses went over the rules and then proceeded to tell how lucky I will be inside because I'm so hot. I didn't let it go to my head because she did out weigh me by 250lbs but I was ready for action. I opened the doors to see no one. I entered the next room to see porn being drowned out by a large man telling two trannys how to change their oil. No really. Not a joke but would be a good one if it was. The next room had a 500 lb lesbian being ridiculed by a dominatrix. The sad part or funny part was the dominatrix kept yelling for her to stand up from a kneeling position but because of her large boned structure she couldn't. Me and another guy rushed over to help her but it was too late. She got a whipping. Next to them was a 499 lb lady with needles sticking in her breast getting whipped. Every time her stud muffin would get started though she needed a break because her legs were numb from standing longer than 2 minutes and she would sit down. Anyone having fun yet? Anyone? Anyone? The finale was a room with 5 80 year old and over guys that were dressed from head to toe in black. Either they were priest or had a Johnny Cash fetish but I didn't get the chance to ask. They were having a wild time and couldn't take questions.  Actually they were standing around discussing football in late February. I counted 12 people inside the visible areas on a Saturday night between 12-2 am. Remember I counted over 30 cars???? Either some people brought every car they own or some of the cars are plants and never move. You don't need a open mind for this place you need no mind. Smoke crack, shoot heroin and drop acid x3 and you might enjoy it otherwise find something else to do. Just my opinion based on 2 dreaded hours there but I promise the other 22 hours its not filled with supermodel sex craved ladies.",0

Ask for 2 vanilla milk shakes and I start to drive to see what I got was 2 cups of ice milk not a shake.

"As a former barista, seeing the barista's dynamics of this store saddens me. There are 4 people on the floor and only one person makes the drinks. You see the other 2 who are not cashiers just chatting. The drink line is long (way piled up to the cashier side) and it took me about 15 minutes to get my drink. I get that there may be a deployment schedule (i.e. only one person is assigned to the bar) but it wont hurt this store if some of the team members would actually step in to help expedite the drinks (knowing that the drink line waay too long). I've trained in different Starbucks stores before (and visited) and I have never seen baristas who prioritize chatting over getting all the drinks done. Even as a customer, I've observed a lot of baristas working as a team in other stores. I hope this store changes for the better.",0
"Wish I could put 0 stars. I had an awful experience trying to transfer to this OBGYN. I was told the doctor and office manager needed to ""approve"" me in order to be seen as a patient. I called back the next day to find out I was ""rejected"" by the doctor, Chelsea Crum, but no one could tell me why, so I asked to talk to the doctor or office manager. I was sent to voicemail, left a voicemail, but my call was never returned. I called back several times over the next few days and was sent to voicemail by the office manager everytime. On top of that, the receptionist was rude. She said that I was probably ""rejected"" for having a balance on my account at my prior OBGYN. I explained the other OBGYN billed the delivery fee up front, so the only balance I had was for a baby I have yet to deliver. Receptionist was not understanding and still said I needed to pay the full bill to be ""approved"" to be seen with Dr. Crum. I would not recommend this OBGYN to anyone.",0
"I made an appointment here for an excision as I was informed by my previous dermatologist days before moving to Charlotte from Boston that a recently biopsied mole was severely atypical and required surgical removal as soon as possible to ensure it did not progress to melanoma. I arrived on time for a 1:00pm appointment and was not informed of any issues regarding time. At 2:00pm, I asked the receptionist if I would be seen anytime soon, at which point I was told that I was next, but was not given any sort of apology or acknowledgement of my already hour-long wait. Shortly thereafter, I was escorted to a treatment room by a nurse who asked me why I was there that day - clearly indicating that not only were they unaware of and unprepared for my need for an excision, but had not reviewed any of the information sent by my previous dermatologist. I then waited for 25 minutes in the treatment room before deciding that I did not to receive any type of care from a medical office run this poorly. I got re-dressed, left the treatment room and asked for my money back - which was done with still zero acknowledgement of the unacceptable (over 1 hour 30 minutes) wait time or apology. I have lived and received medical care in many areas across the country, and this was by far the worst excuse for a medical office I have ever experienced.",0
"Stopped for a fast lunch yesterday, yuuuk!  Sat a a fold down type table, had to got the the restroom to get wet paper towels to bring back to table and scrub down the table. ( BTW  THE bathroom was discussing!). A TURN OFF RIGHT FROM THE START,  let me just say that I've been to CPK  multiple times and have always enjoyed. My husband ordered the thin crust artichoke pizza, delicious!  I ordered the crunchy vegetable salad with peanut dressing, really bad!

"I love Hampton hotels more than anything but this was a terrible experience.  Surly staff that was never at the desk. If you called out hello, they told you to wait, usually as they finished texting on their phones. And dont count on housekeeping. They never serviced our room, no new towels no remade beds. Only the post it note on the bed saying it was cleaned for us. Also, the elevators over heated at midnight setting the alarm off and putting the elevators out of service. Thank goodness I was staying on the first floor with my disabled mother. Run away from this property as quickly as possible!",0

"Shockingly horrible experience at this L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Montreal! We've dined a couple times at the full Robuchon restaurant in Las Vegas and have always felt like those were one of the top meals we've had of all time (this is including quite an extensive list of Top San Pellegrino/World's Top 50 and Michelin star restaurants).However, this experience in Montreal was definitely by far one of THE WORST.The location is confusing and hard to find, it's awkward going into a 2/3 star level casino that's loud and rowdy, just to get to the restaurant. It felt like walking thru a Walmart to dine at Alinea in the back room.Once inside though, it feels much better...BUT, our table was not ready for a good 25-30 min AFTER our reservation time, which is ok since things do happen from time to time but I would think that at the very least, the hostess/manager would offer some tea or mocktails for us while we had to wait.When we did get seated, there was no acknowledgement by anyone behind the chef's counter (which felt more like sitting at a regular hotel bar...with a kitchen behind the ""bartenders"" that you can see from your seat)...my fiance and I waited and waited and despite 3-5 staff members passing by, no one ever made eye contact to welcome us, no one even brought water/asked if we wanted sparkling or still...the bare minimum you'd expect at any restaurant esp after having to wait 30 minutes already for our seats.Next thing you know, another older couple were seated next to us and they seemed like regulars/knew several of the restaurant staff...they were warmly greeted and before the two could even get seated at the counter, they already had water and someone taking their drink orders!It really felt like a slap in the face and as I made backup plans by phone (resulting in going to Maison Boulud instead later)...my fish fiance still was not able to get anyone's attention at all despite 2-3 staff members chattering with the old couple next to us!50 minutes past our reservation, we just decide to leave...frustrated and shockingly disappointed in the lack of service here! It really did NOT feel like the classic Robuchon vibe at all but even then, I can't say I've had many/any experiences of waiting almost an hour with no one coming by to greet us or even to bring water to the table!",0
This is the worst experience at a restaurant that I have ever had. It took 30 minutes just to receive water. The steak was mostly fat. The service was awful. I would give this zero stars if I could.,0
I bought their dog hair removal package and paid $50 for it. They did a terrible job and took 45 minutes. I had to complain to the manager and stand over the workers shoulders to have  him re-vaccum the carpet. They forgot to shampoo the mats and I  had to remind them. By that time the guy who sold me the package was gone. They try but the kids they hire are just not motivated or skilled. I made the mistake of buy windshield repair and they did a terrible job at that. I have to now fight with them to fix it.,0

"When I'm at a hotel, the number one most important thing to me is cleanliness. Unfortunately, my experience at Caesars at the Palace Tower was not the best. Cheaper hotels actually are cleaner than Caesars. Now I believe that hotels do not change their sheets. Came in to the room and the bed sheets had blue lint. No one was wearing blue. So we call for house keeping to come and change it while we go out. When we came back, the bed was made beautifully however, it was still the same sheets from earlier with the blue lint. Now I have proof that the do not change the sheets. What more for them to change it when you don't ask when they don't even change when you ask them!!!! Totally disgusting!",0
Lissy Davisin the last weekFood was not good. The waitress was very forgetful therefore we received our food late and incorrect. They rarely ever have available what's on the menu. Nice atmosphere however the waitress and cook did not receive any good ratings from me. Unfortunately there are no Latino/Cuban restaurants near by so I believe this restaurant survives somewhat because of the location. Waitress provided incorrect order as well as not attend the table so we had lack of refills.,0
"I've been with Wells Fargo since 2007, I think I even signed up at this location or it soon became my home bank. That was almost 10 years ago when they actually cared about their customers. I bank with this location for my job and not for myself anymore it's that bad. I drive 15 minutes out of my way to go to the location I like. This one is literally .3 miles away from where i live. That's how bad it is. Now here's why. Pay attention, business accounts newly in the area. They have 1 business line and usually 3 non business open on average. If they don't have a business customer in line, they'll take their non business accounts at the business window. No problem, that's great. But when I stand at the business line for 23 minutes behind a non business account and watch all of the employees including the banking manager standing around not taking me because I'm business. Here's there excuse. The non business lines don't have suitable change for businesses. I don't get much in change!!! Not even if I don't need change, they won't take me or any other business people. So then I start using the drive thru because I don't like the fact that they know you have a business to run and make me wait 20 minutes in the store. Well, I was told by the banking manager through the drive thru that I've been using 2 months when I don't need rolled coins in change that my change requests are too high (mind you, a hundred in $1 bills must be outrageous via the drivethru!!) and I can't do that anymore. She's never stopped me from doing that and I've been to other locations that loved when I did drive thru for change for work. Anyway. Long story short, take care of your business customers because chances are they're more than likely personal customers and more than likely moving every account they have (4!) to a different bank. Al because of one location and how they treat their customers. Loved this spot 5+ years ago but now it doesn't even deserve the 1.5 star they have on here.",0
"You can read all the other reviews here for Global Water, nothing has changed.

I don't know if she got bother because I was looking at the menu a little to long, maybe like 2-3 minutes. Keep in mind it was my first time there and first time ever trying boba tea. I expect something totally different due to the reviews on here. I would answer her with ""yes please"" and ""thank you"" and her attitude continued. She honestly gave me a bad first impression of this place. Probably won't be going back. Only giving it one stars because the drink was actually good. But that girl needs to work on some serious customers service!!!! I get it were all human and we all have problems but leave your problems at the door and don't bring them into you workplace and take it out on your customers. Give the place bad rep.",0
"NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  Our usual pho place closed early, found this place.  Not busy, but took 45 minutes for two bowls of pho. No apology, nothing.    I used the last three pieces to toilet paper in the Ladies room. No paper towels. No hot water. So how do the employees wash their hands before handling food??? Nope, nope, nopity nope!",0
Worst Pharmacy Ever!The technicians are robots and literally have no souls when dealing with patients. But what can you expect when they get paid nearly nothing and most of them are ghetto and don't know what professionalism was if they were shown how with colors and shapes. If you try to ask questions they just shut you down and they yell your medical information for all to hear. I am sure that's violating privacy right? The Pharmacist won't answer your questions and most of the time they don't know much about the medication. Which is truly scary. All of the Pharmacy staff should get refresher courses on how to run a pharmacy and how to act towards people and not act like a bunch of savages always yelling and talking down to patients. There's a CVS down the street so if this Walgreens isn't up to your standards go to another pharmacy. It's better when people actually help you with your medication and not make you feel bad for taking it. Shame on the staff for making people feel bad about diabetes or high blood pressure. The pharmacist told an elderly lady she didn't know what some of her meds were and to just read the guide....shame.,0
"Steer clear. Unprofessional, rude, uncaring, downright mean staff and Dr. Siegert has no interest in having her staff act any other way.  It's like a cabal.  I was shocked that any veterinary office could be as nasty as these people are when you ask a question or have need of help.  I left the practice and found much better care for my dog elsewhere.",0
"It all started w dropping my Iphone 6S and shattering the glass. I took it into the store at Norterra and the service was great. The gal was thorough, and kind. I thought this is awesome they will replace my glass for $130 and all would be well. About an hour later the repair was complete and it looked brand new. About 2 days later however things began to change.... all of a sudden the phone would not respond to touch, would ghost touch all over the screen and was just simply whacky. I brought it back in and again the service was great, they told me to change a setting do an update and see if that fixed it.... a Day later it was obvious that it didn't I again went back to the store this time with video in hand showing that screen not responding, etc.... this time around they said they would warranty the phone and replace the screen again... They were convinced it was a bad screen. Again, an hour later the repair was complete and all looked good until.... I walked out to the car, went to make a call and again was completely frozen. I walked back in the store but the phone would not repeat the problem and appeared to working correctly. This did not last long and over the next few days I simply dealt with it. I finally bit the bullet and went to Verizon and bought a new phone. When I went back to the store for a refund they wanted the glass back which would make the phone worthless.... I said no and after the manager called and basically told me that they are a retail shop and in order to issue a refund they need their product back. This is horrible. the fact is that my phone was working just great before I brought it in for repair. They opened up the phone in order to replace the glass and in my estimation at the same time created more problems. Be leary..... their is always a risk when someone opens up your phone, since they wont issue the refund I will be contacting my credit card company and charging back as again the SERVICE that they performed broke my phone and as a result I had to spend money out of pocket to purchase a new one when they were UNABLE to fix it.... I told the District manager I would be filing this complaint and she didn't seem to concerned.",0
So we stayed here for cheer competition and my fiances first time in vegas. I was a little bummed at the service we recieved his first time in Vegas. First of all when we checked in I asked for a higher floor so he could see more of the strip but we ended up getting the 6th floor....ok whatever. Then we get in the room and I see a hole on the wall by the window...ok fine its not the best of hotels...well my last straw was the yellow stains on the bathroom carpet!!!! like really you couldnt bleach that or throw it away!!! The casino service wasnt any better either. We sat down to gamble and it took the cocktail waitress 20 min to get to us and we waited another 15 min and never got our drink...Over all not happy with this hotel.,0
"Ok, you would think they would lotion your feet after they remove the cuticle.  No. I had to ask after the lady completed the service. I have a pedicure with a design and I am supposed to walk around with dry looking feet?  Or was I supposed to go home and moisturize my feet after a paid pedicure.  Let's talk about customer service.  The only one who were friendly and gave good customer service was the very young girl at the counter.  And the lady with the pretty eyelashes at the 1st nail seat.  The lady who did the nail design was so rude, and combative.  I asked the guy in the beginning how much for a nail design that I showed him in the picture.  He said $5.00.When the lady who did the design finished, she said $10.00.  When I said calmly the guy said $5.00.  She got a flyer that said French is $5.00.  Then she got a flyer that said design $5.00.  So French with a silver line is $10.00?  IT IS STILL FRENCH.  Why an additional $5.00.  Lol.  I would have given a $20.00 tip in the beginning.  But her rude nasty attitude has left an impression.  I will not return to AZ BLUE SKY Nails & SPA.  Customer Service is Key.  She needs to learn that.",0
"Holy moly, we purchased a unit and agreed on the price to INCLUDE free delivery with the salesperson. he said the owner would be ok with this as we would pay cash and we live very close 5 min drive. We dropped off the cash and I called the store to arrange with the owner the drop off date (as he wasn't there when we looked at it and also when we dropped off the cash). I left two voicemails with the store and finally heard back, owner was refusing to deliver the piece because the sales person sold it to us for too low. He left an extremely rude voicemail. He was now asking for more money for the delivery. After many arguments on the phone which included the specific sales person begging us to throw the owner 20 or 30 to delivery it, we agreed if it meant the beloved piece would finally make it to us. We even asked for our cash back, we would take our business elsewhere and of corse the owner didn't want to do that, he refused complaining on and on to us about the price the sales person agreed to. The piece already was over $2000, it wasn't a cheap piece. We finally got it and it was delivered by *now* a very nice owner......p.s we live a five minute drive from the store and offered many different times during the day for it to be dropped off to avoid any traffic on the owners part. Avoid this store unless you can carry the item out!!! The owner is completely unreasonable and very hard to deal with.",0
The service is awful! The internet speed is only half of what was promised! The third party sales person messed up the whole order. I called to cancel the order and they said its been 33 days since you signed up and that I would have to pay a $240 fee. They have yet to provide the service that they promised!!!Avoid!!!,0
"Robert is a complete fake. He takes your money up front. Says all the right things to have confidence that he will help you.After two years of delays, going to his office that is now rent a room and him not being there is all just a made up business. I had to get in touch with the IRS myself and work out the details and all the meetings and information that I provided to Robert never made it to the IRS. So after two years of stalling I still have my tax issue and now two years or interest that I have to add to my cost.Robert should be shut down and not take others moneyStay away",0
"Walk in one afternoon to a restaurant thats crowded with one server. He tries his best to cater to all the customers but at the end I think he gets lots of funny stares.Do I think Mr. Tofu is good, honestly I think not. I ordered the tofu soup and add extra $7 for short ribs. Not only the short ribs are tasteless and burned, it is chewy and really low quality. I ordered the bulgogi too and to be honest with you, you should go to SOYO for korean food. I vow never to come back and would only eat at SOYO for korean food. One and done mr Tofu. U are not for me.",0
"OH. My Gosh. This was the worst customer experience I have EVER had anywhere at anytime!!!! Truly maddening! My salesperson, Naomi, literally lied, I mean Blatantly made answers up to the questions I asked. Such as: what is the difference between the Google Pixel 3XL and the 3aXL? Her response was ""the color"". When I pointed out that there was a $500.00 difference she continued straight faced by saying ""oh, um, this is an entree level phone and this is a higher level phone"" . Naturally I wanted to know what that meant and how the phones differed so I asked her and she responded by saying ""it's exactly like it sounds, this is a more basic phone and this one is a better model"". Um, what????? So my husband intervened and asked:"" so are the cameras the same?"" She said ""no, the XL had a better camera"". We were looking for clarification so we asked her to specify a bit at which point she finally got frustrated with us calling her out on her absolute BS and said""let me print info on both out so you can see them."" Great, the most decent thing out of her mouth yet. Of course she was not capable of doing this task either so we went behind the desk where another employee ,Rachel, was also standing and she chimed in with a very simple explanation of the differences between the 2 phones. In this explanation she pointed out that the cameras we're EXACTLY the same (a lie Naomi spewed in an effort to appear like she knew what she was talking about). This saga continued, trust me .After I purchased the phone she put it in a bag and tried to send me on my way....without even trying to turn it on for me to show me it worked. When I asked her to get it all up and running she reluctantly obliged. She could NOT get my service turned on and she was trying to hide her incompetence from her co-workers so we struggled for a good 30 minutes doing this..after I begged the manager Greg to help me get my new phone up and running he figured it out and we were out the door 5 minutes later. I am a compassionate person and totally understand that everyone starts somewhere and if Naomi was new to this job and was unsure of the answers to my questions and simply said ""hey, I'm not sure, let me go find out for you, "" i would've supported her completely. All day. But......instead she made up answers with a straight face and was condescending at the same time. I would NEVER, EVER go back to this store!",0
Visiting from Philadelphia . Food tastes awful. Chicken was very dry. And I got very sick within a few hours of eating. I would stay away from this place.,0
"Interesting that this place can manage to serve officially the most tasteLESS food! Forget the fish, Flavor or Freshness, I really couldn't tell if they were potato chips or some edible crispy bonded paper... All stars are just because, one needs a special talent to pulls this off!!! It's amazing as how tasteLESS flavorless simple food can be.. I still am baffled!! There are signs here that their crew appears on-off on wing-cooking.. are they sure the show is not ""worst cooks.."" ;) whatta job guys.. all said service is courteous and decent wait time!!",0
"Despite the place being empty I had to wait for over 10minutes without being so much as acknowledged. My miso was lukewarm, ingredients were stale, tempura was cold and limp, tuna in the ""hot roll"" had an awful chewy texture and there was far too much rice. By far one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had and at such a steep price",0
"Tried this place twice. The first time I tried Ruby.  Nice lady, but the haircut was very blah and looked old-ladyish.  So, I went back 5 weeks later and tried Kira.  The cut was better, but it was the WORST styling job ever!  So bad, I was embarrassed to even walk to my car.  Had plans for the day, but went right home to wash and restyle it.  My husband got a cut there too, and while the cut was fine, his was styled awful too!  Overpriced for sure.  We will never return.",0
Order food an hour before lunch on their website. I left specific instructions for the food to be at the front desk at 5pm. The driver called at 451. We are not allowed phones during working hours. Drive left before 5pm. I called the location at 449pm to find out where food was. They said driver was on his way. I called at 525 to see where my food was. They told me at the location the driver had already been there and left. Fortunately I got a refund but the whole situation could have been avoid if they actually followed the items for the food deliver. Why have a food delivery comments section if they won't follow it.,0
"I loved Jimmy John's.  But recently there is something seriously wrong at this location on Arizona Ave. I always order a Slim 5, its just bread, meat and cheese.  But the past 5 times I've ordered this simple sandwich, they manage to screw it up. Its always missing cheese or they give me a #5 with all the condiments on it (im the pickiest eater in world and hate condiments on my sandwich). I can understand how a slim 5 and #5 could get mixed up but the other 4 times, the cheese is missing!  How difficult can it be to put cheese and meat on bread? Really now. Maybe if the manager would stop juggling sandwiches, dropping them on the floor then serving those sandwiches to customers,  and pay more attention to what the staff is doing, there wouldn't be a problem. But when I see the manager messing around plus 12 employees working, I can't even understand why the hell they forget the fucking cheese!!!! Ridiculous. I called and complained and left a survey for corporate,  now they're blowing up my phone trying to ""make it right"" with me, again, for the 5th time. And calling me as much as they have is harassment. This is how you make it right Jimmy John's... PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Stop fucking around and do your job, its really not that difficult.  You've lost a very loyal customer who came there weekly and ordered catering often. All this because of your negligence over a few pieces of cheese. How sad.",0
"I came in on a Tuesday/Wednesday to order a custom cake and I knew that it was last minute but ""The Cupcakery"" was kind enough to fit in my cake order. I thought what I asked for was a simple request (please see attached photos) ... the cake itself was good, the butter cream was a little thick and the fondant bird/brown background was a little hard so when we cut the cake it just cracked/crumbled. The cake wasn't cheap it cost $150 AND I EVEN TIPPED THESE PEOPLE ahead of time because they were so accommodating last minute. I am highly disappointed with how this cake turned out. This was the main dessert at my sisters first communion celebration and I was ashamed to even take it out of the box and place it on the table. If you can't make the picture I show/text you then don't sign up to make it simple as that!",0
"We stayed here over the memorial day weekend, and will not come back again . We stayed in the Impanema tower of this place and it is very run down and filthy. the bathroom reeked of urine, and the tile floors are never mopped. Carpets are filthy and the bed and the couch sagged in the middle. Told the front desk and was moved to another room in the exact same condition. . front desk did not care at all about complaints. We will never come back to this hotel again. And the Voodoo steak up on the roof will rob you blind on a dinner that lacks food, they put as little as they can on that plate and charge you as much as they can for it. Total rip offs!!!",0
"We had an extremely disappointing birthday party for my daughter there last week. Our guests waited in a line out the door ( literally) for 20 minutes to get a wristband for our party.  We needed to oversee every aspect. The pizza was delivered to the wrong party, we had to find out what happened. water that was promised to us at set up wasn't delivered until we asked twice. I had to drag garbage cans over from the desk as no one could help us with that aspect.  While I understand that they were unexpectedly short-staffed, my daughter only has one birthday a year, and we spent it apologizing to our guests, and trying to organize a very disorganized situation. The woman who worked there that day is evidently the manager and didn't seem to care when I expressed my disappointment. To make matters worse, we send our kids there for gymnastics but  have decided to send them elsewhere after this experience. I'm only writing this so that others don't book a party there. I wish I had known better!",0
I would not take young kids here. My son is 4 and he there while we went to the movies. Towards the end i think he got nervous I wasn't coming back to get him. A staff member called and I said the movie is almost over and she offered him a snack. When I picked him up he was sitting at the table completely alone crying and nobody was comforting him. Will not return.,0
"It was a bad experience. The food was good which was the only good thing. My boyfriend and I sat there nearly the entire time being completely unacknowledged and if he hadn't said anything I think we would have been sitting there even longer. We had asked for a refill on salsa but the guy took it and must have forgotten. He never brought it. Normally that wouldn't be that big of a deal but we got our food and nobody asked how it was once or paid any attention to us. The entire time we were there. I saw other people being attended to constantly and I felt like it was rude that we were ignored the whole time and other people were getting 5 star service. We were done eating and were wanting dessert but nobody asked us until my boyfriend caught the guy's attention. We ate the dessert and then were obviously done and were wanting the check but again, nobody came to check in with us. Almost 20 minutes went by (this was the third time we were waiting for someone to just look at us) and my boyfriend stood up for about 5 minutes trying to get someone's attention and again was completely ignored. He ended up going over to the manager asking for the check. I don't know if they were biased toward us since we looked young but we always tip well when going out to eat and would have tipped a lot more if someone had paid attention to us. I felt very unwelcome and don't want to go back. I would give zero stars but the food was good. I don't think either of us deserved that and it was the worst service I've ever had and we eat out a lot. We left the restaurant and the hostess didn't look at us or say anything. I am a little upset over it.",0

"Worst nail salon I've ever been to. My nails lifted the next day!!! The third day my pinky nail popped off in the shower. The fourth, my index nails. The fifth,  i had all 10 of them on my dresser! I was hesitant of writing the review as i hate writing negative reviews but everyone who saw my nails the day of and the day after told me i needed to. My nails overall lasted me 5 days. (Thats only because i had super glue to keep glueing them on) Absolutely ridiculous.  I got these done on June 9th, lasted until the 13th. I knew when she put them on it wasnt going to stay. I am only writing this late because i felt bad because the girl who did them was so sweet.  But i feel she was being rushed by her manager because i came in at 4 when they closed at 5. The manager didnt even let her dry my nails. I get it, they were closing when i was done, but i tipped very generously for coming in later and she practically rushed me out with wet nails. Anyway, dont go here. I paid more than i ever have and they lasted the shortest they ever have. Usually i can go a good 3 weeks at my regular salon. I only came here because they were closed. Im so disappointed. And angry.",0
"Bought a chair and ottoman 1 month ago.  They said 7-10 days.  I called about 20 days and was told it was delayed, but they had no details.  On hold now after calling the store probably 12 times (got ""disconnected"" while on hold w/ the first person) and then kept calling back to get full VM.  Really?  They don't check and return calls?  This current call someone immediately put me on hold w/ out even saying hello.  Now I know why the store is empty and there are never the same sales people there.  Good prices, but if they can't deliver, not worth MY TIME.  Use their prices as a bargaining tool at other furniture stores, but the other stores probably know about Big's performance and will call you out.",0
"Got a shellac mani and pedi, they had a special going on for $40. So I figured why not, since I was in the neighborhood. The man is kind, but you can tell he's not an experienced esthetician. He missed a lot of basic steps when dong my pedi, which was annoying because I kept telling him what to do. With the shellac mani, he basically butchered my cuticle with the cuticle nipper. Such a nightmare!! I had to call one of the ladies over to fix it (who I think is the owner), she did a bit of a better job but it was still total crap. Lastly, the paint job she did with my mani was horrific. It's all on the corner of my skin and isn't smooth. What got me most annoyed was the fact that they're advertising a $40 promo. But when you get to the counter it's $40+ tax, even if you pay cash. I don't mind paying taxes,  but at least advertise that on ALL signs!! Not just the one inside in a size 12 font. DO NOT go here. There's 2 other nail salons right around the corner who I bet do a better job",0
"Food is great there and I have had wonderful experiences there- until this morning. My friends and I went here to eat after a late night out. Usually the food comes out quickly, however, on this particular morning it took quite a bit. One of the guys that came later and ordered after Us ended up Getting his food first. I gave the bartender a hard time about it thinking he must've forgotten the rest of our food order. Well, in all my years of working in hospitality and the service industry, I know how frustrating customers can be. Perhaps I was frustrating this morning, however, when the bartender told me to ""shut the f**k up"" (exact words he used) my desire to ever set foot in this restaurant disappeared. I was in shock. This caused a huge commotion among myself and my friend and we were asked to leave the establishment. As I left I happily gave him a piece of my mind. Hopefully no one ever experiences what I did. Have to give another poor rating to this restaurant. First of all, after being told to shut the f*** up by the drunk bartender on duty there one morning, I have yet to hear a peep out of the managers of this restaurant. But whatever, not too shocked about that. However, this bartender continues to talk about that night and lying about the facts of what happened. He continuously talks bad about my friend and I to whoever he thinks will listen. I'm sorry, but I don't know what kind of business owners are okay with having a person like that- classless and rude- to be employed and represent their brand the way he does. Keep on coming with the rude comments about CUSTOMERS, who got cussed at and thrown out because we were upset about our delay on our order. I happily returned the insults To him on my way out the door. In any case, the longer he tries to smear my name and my friends, the longer I will continue w the Yelp reviews. Hope he gets drunk at work again tonight!. Good service can make up for bad food, but good food CANNOT make up for bad service. Little update on this place",0
"I walked in here with the high hopes of the terrific meals I've gotten at the Westgate location, and walked out terribly disappointed.  The hummus was running and flavorless.  The falafel - which I've praised as one of my favorites in CLE - was oily and inedible.  My pita for the hummus was dry and stale.  When I pointed this out to the kid working behind the counter he looked at me like I was speaking in a different language.  For all the love and praise I've given to the Westgate location I am in awe as to how bad this location was.Oh, and upon walking in the door all of their patio furniture was piled up by the entrance making it hard to even get it.  The owner really needs to spend more time at this location, or it will not last very long.",0
"wow, im surprised that a place could get three bad reviews in a row, and i'm adding a fourth at the moment.my mom bought a deal pkg from those daily deals.  the facials were fine, but the manicures and pedicures my mom and i received we different. they skipped buffing my nails and skipped buffing my moms feet.  when they did the nails, they hardly had any selection of nail polish.  when they applied the nail polish it was all thick and didnt spread out smoothly, it was messy, plus they didnt fill out the nail properly, there were lots of unpainted gaps on the nails.  when we told her the nail polish was too thick (and it was obvious), she got all mad and started throwing the nail polish bottles into her little bin of nail polishes.  some of these people are not well trained and arent doing the whole job properly.  usually students are supposed to be supervised to ensure they did a good job and to get feedback, but they aren't and thats probably why they are all getting away with doing a bad job.my feedback is to have 'customers' who come in to do an evaluation form if the people are too lazy to come actually supervise or ask how the experience was.also the place you get the stuff done is, is a big open room with four massage tables and a few pedicure chairs and folding screens to give you PARTIAL privary while you're getting a facial or massage done. very low class place.",0
I would give it zero stars if I could. We made an appointment for 1:30 got here around 1:15 and was told it would be about 45 minutes before we got back and walk ins would be about 1-1/2 hours. Everyone that was in before us left and every person that came in after us also got taken back and left. We waited for 2 hours. We were told 2 different prices by 2 different people who were sitting right next to each other. I would not recommend coming and wasting your time here. We've found cheaper and closer to home that we will be going to next time. We will never be coming back here.,0
"I was contacted by Temp me Staffing through Linkedin regarding a contract Accounting Manager's position in the Colchester Vermont area.  They had reached out to me several weeks prior for a Staff Accountant's position which was a lower level position due my qualifications and career interests.  Having come from a very recent contract in which 2 employees had left the accounting department at the same time, I had some concerns that there were 2 open positions at roughly the same time.  In my previous contract, I covered both positions for over a 3 month period and did not want to be in the same situation.   I explained my concerns to the recruiter and specifically inquired if the Accounting Manager's position was newly established or a replacement along with the Staff Accountant position.   I was informed that both positions were newly created positions.  I was also informed that the company was moving their operation from Tennessee to Colchester, VT and I would be involved in setting up the Accounting Department with one direct report.  I sent my resume and was set up for a phone interview.  Prior to the interview, I asked for information about the individual I would be interviewing with as I always like to do my research.  I was told his name by the recruiter that he oversaw the accountant department.  She stated in her email ""he doesn't have a Linkedin or else I would send it.""    Prior to the phone interview, I not only found his Linkedin profile but learned that he himself was a contracted employee such as myself, on a temporary assignment.  I located a news article in April on the internet stating that the company was moving FROM the Colchester, VT area to Tennessee.   During my phone interview, I learned that 4 out of 5 of the employees in the Accounting Department left the company due the company's intention to relocate their operations.  This included the VP of Finance, 2 staff accountants and 1 Accounts Payable positions who had transferred already.  Not only were these NOT new positions but basically the entire Finance Department was practically non-existent.  The client was looking for someone to keep the department operational and make improvements prior to relocating to Tennessee.  They also wanted the managerial position to oversee the 2 Accounts Payable individuals that are now in Tennessee and the Staff Accountant just hired.  Needless to say, I felt totally blindsided.  When I spoke to the recruiter, she claimed that she was given the wrong information about the position being new by someone else at Temp Me Staffing but that she stood behind the fact that she had told me they would be moving operations out of the area and not into.  I asked her if it made sense that a company that is relocating to Tennessee would be creating new positions in Vermont.  I have not heard back from anyone at the agency regarding my feedback.I've worked with placement agencies in the past on and have never had the experience of receiving such misinformation before, especially when I specifically asked the history of the position.  I would urge anyone dealing with this temp agency to do their due diligence on the company and their history prior to even agreeing to an interview.  Direct all of your questions regarding the position to the company themselves to be certain they are answered correctly.",0
"These people should be in jail. I called about an adverse reaction to a drug they gave me a prescription for. She took the details and said she would get right back with a replacement. 2 1/2 hours later no call back. I try to call and only get a machine saying we will get back to you. These people should't be allowed anywhere near the medical industry. Maybe cleaning toilets or some other menial job, if someone closely supervises them.",0
"I went to CRH with my little one as she had fallen off her scooter and complained of severe pain in both arms. CRH failed her miserably. Difficult to get a w/c for her to sit. Staff did not assist in lifting her to put her in the w/c, or assisted lifting her onto the bed, she asked for pain medicine and was told 3 times, we will get you some. Never did, I even asked for her. She ended up with a buckle fracture. We were told to see her PCP in 1-2 weeks. Did not get a referral to an Orthopedic Dr. To top this off, we were given a script for Tylenol with codeine 900ml!  Really?!  That amount is crazy!  She really would have needed about 60ml. Our PCP was astounded about the amount of codeine and no referral to an orthopedic. I will NOT go back to Chandler Regional Hospital ever!!!!!!!!  Not impressed!",0
"We tried this out on a Friday seafood night. $22.95 per person.Very disappointing.The food selection was very small, and very average.Nothing was very good, at best it was generic and at worst overcooked and blah.Lots of desserts, acceptable but nothing exceptional.Disappointing introduction to Vegas buffets.My wife says, avoid the sushi, it's flavorless.",0
We were really enjoying this place. It's gone way down hill. What drew us there mostly was the great staff in particular the bar. One of our favorites is gone when asked where she was got a rude response which was very distasteful considering she was one of our favorites to talk to and enjoyed her recommendations. The other people we thought were inviting are now in other positions and it's gone to all of their heads. Way to keep it classy Taphouse. Your intelligent staff members at bar that had class and had intelligent things to say are bad mouthed and the others are very disappointing. Bad business. The managers should get a better handle on staff that is a draw. Food is ok but not enough to keep people coming back with out good bones. Nobody likes staff who continues to push one or two items on the menu obnoxiously. We sent friends they were very disappointed. Food was bar had a bar girl who said she was in college and pushed on them trying things they didn't want. They said they were vegetarians but she tried to act all sweet and tell them they should try the meet anyway they would be surprised. We have been entrapped by her before. Management should choose staff by audience. You clueless should go to the new zipps where they don't need to engage. We have sent numerous people. Not anymore. Smarten up know your audience and choose the good ones that can interact with the demographic of paradise valley.,0
Ordered 3 ready to wear shirts from them online over a month ago. They charged me upfront for the shirts and said they would ship in 7-10 days. I have emailed 3 times asking for a timeline of when I can expect the shirts and have had radio silence from them. This is an unacceptable business practice. My only option at this point will be to call my credit card company to report the transaction as fraud as it does not appear they ever plan on sending me my shirts.,0
"Do not even WASTE your time and money here. First, people are simply RUDE. I was with my baby in the stroller and they would just get clothes and hit her with them. Second, the sales aren't that great and the quality of clothes is worse than Goodwill.I got better sales at Dillard's in Fashion Square Mall on Uggs than in this crappy store.Employees are great, the customers are just awful.",0
"Showed up late for our consultation, never called to let us know. Seemed like he didn't want to be here from the start. Said we would get our quote emailed by the weekend or latest Mon/tues. well, it's been over a week and still nothing. Quite annoying that he even wasted our time as we don't have much time to spare as it is",0
"New owners- I am so sad the original recipes have changed! I miss the sandwiches the way they used to be. The meat, the lettuce, the cheese, even the mayonnaise has changed. Doesn't seem like the same quality. And no more house dressing. The new owners are extremely nice but I am really disappointed in the sandwiches. People go to this location for their favorite sandwich that they have been getting for years. I was not expecting something new and not as good.",0
Ordered pick up came in order wasn't ready they mistook my order and just got started spent my lunch time waiting for an order that was called in 30 minutes prior! Pad Thai was bland with 0 spice after I had requested it and she assured me the cook knew!,0
HORRIBLE BAR SERVICE ..visting from west hollywood gay bar capital. I waited at bar at order station for 20 mins while everyone around bar got drinks. Take ur ass across street so u dont waste time waiting for bad service,0
"A very outdated restaurant, relying purely on their location for any potential of staying afloat. We were at our table but saw other guests served before us, despite seated after us. Not a good start. The server was less than helpful, never topped up our glasses of water despite ordering two bottles of wine, no oyster forks for the escargot or oysters, the starter plates were marginally dirty, no attention from the waitstaff, etc. Even the couple at the table beside us looked over to mentioned their experience being as poor as ours. The rice seemed like rice-a-roni, the lobster was questionably fresh, the asparagus was cooked to a lower and much blander standard than I do at home regularly, etc. I would venture to this restaurant if you are into investing your money into a less than average and over-priced meal.",0
Worst burger place ever. Felt like I was eating school cafeteria food at best. What kind of restaurant turns their shake machine off at 6 pm? Food was cold except for the zucchini which was also subpar. I would never eat at this sh**hole again. Yuck!!!,0
"On my initial visit to Men's Wearhouse the manager assisted me with picking out two suits. Although I explained to the manager that I wear suits for work she felt the need to speak to me as a child and as if I've never worn a suit before i.e explaining to me multiple times that I need to match the correct pants with the correct blazer, and even made it a point to demonstrate reading the tags on both multiple times. I let it go thinking maybe that's just her personality. However, after reading several other similar reviews with the same manager described it appears it was more likely the fact that I came in wearing casual attire, a pair of shorts and a T-shirt. I don't wear business attire on my day off, to go buy more business attire. I went through with the purchase and was told they would be tailored and ready for pick up Friday. I returned Friday to pick up my suits and a male associate places them in a dressing room for me. When I enter the dressing room immediately upon visual inspection of the suits they're extremely wrinkled and have hairs and threads all over them. Then I come to find out that whoever placed the blazers and pants together mixed them up. After placing the correct pants with the correct blazers I tried one on. It was very unsatisfying trying on a dirty suit. I then returned to the dressing room and brought both suits out and explained I would like a refund. The male associate immediately stated they weren't going to give me a refund. He then said ""I'll get the manager"". The same woman who assisted me initially came to the register and in a rude tone stated ""what's going on here"" while opening up the suits. I explained to the woman that I was unsatisfied with the condition my suits were presented for pick up. She stated ""well we can clean them now"". I asked why that hadn't been done prior to my arrival, to no answer. I explained that I was also unsatisfied with the entire experience of the purchase including the customer service. With spending close to $900 on two suits you would expect a better customer service experience and that your suits be cleaned and pressed upon pick up. The manager than stated she would refund me however that she was going to make a note on my account that stated I obviously didn't need the suits and that's why I was returning them, not that they were dirty. She stated this was so that next time I come in they will be able to see it if I decided to purchase something else. Almost as a threat or a form of retaliation due to me returning the items. There are a ton of suit stores in Las Vegas that will provide a better service for a more reasonable price. You would think Men's Wearhouse would do anything they could to retain customers with all the competitors.",0
"The store itself is very small, and not necessarily the cleanest restaurant I've ever been in.  However, there's always a line and everyone raves... so I tried.  It was a Friday during Lent, so I ordered Daily Special #3- cheese quesadilla with rice & beans.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good.  It was very average (and admittedly the blandest Mexican food I've ever seen... although I can say it probably would have been better with meat).  The price was appropriate, and the portion was large.  I was definitely full when I left.  However, my biggest complaint is that the staff barely spoke English.  If you speak fluent Spanish, great.  But I don't (not since high school), and I was highly annoyed that they called out my order in Spanish.  I know numbers in Spanish, so I'm glad I figured it out.    I probably won't go back.   Overall I wasn't that impressed with the food, even if the price was decent and the portion was large.  I could easily make the same quality food myself.  At least the wait was short, even though the place was busy at lunch time.  I might have rated 2 stars if perhaps they made more of an effort to speak English.  Now, before you call me racist or whatever, keep in mind that when I go to a Chinese restaurant, they speak English.  When I go to an Italian restaurant, they speak English, and so on and so forth.  I just think if you're going to take my American dollar, you should be able to ask for it in English.",0
"Came here on a Wednesday it was super dead and no one was even to be seen inside so me and my bf sat ourselves down contemplating to leave because no one was helping us. Then a lady approached us 5 min later so we decided to stay. I had the shrimp ceviche and it was delicious but I thought it was half price of 2.50 for each one and when we get the bill they charged me 5$ for it so I told the lady I had to call her over because they wouldn't even check up on us and she explained ""well that's only for the small you got the big one"" well you never explained to me at all or told me the difference all I did was point to the happy hour Wednesday so she should've known. They fixed this issue but they were super rude about it and handed us our bill and the lady stared as my bf signed the receipt the whole time like how awkward?? You never stare at a customer while they are filling out their receipt+tip. So rude I will never come back here.",0
"Please save your money... This show is UNWATCHABLE.  We've been to every cirque show and this is just five steps down in terms of quality, performances, creativity, everything.  We were cracking up when we shouldn't have been it was so bad.  Then we got upset when we realized we paid $150 a head to go see what was essentially amateur hour theater.  It's like something you see on a cruise ship or a high school musical... but worse because of the money you're spending.  Applause after every number was tepid... like at 40% (you never see that at a Cirque show) and the people that were excited were over 70.Called Cirque customer service who couldn't care less... they ""took down our comments"" but not our name or contact info and basically gave us no consideration.  They are attaching their name to this thing and collecting the check...will read reiews next time before we trust the Cirque brand again.  We saw a production of ""Legally Blonde"" for $40 and it was better than this.",0
"This place does not look like nothing much, but being located on Queen St W., I expected it to be a good mani/pedi. First of all the nail salon was dirty and disorganized. Tools for nails were not sanitized properly, and the person doing the mani/pedi had no idea what she was doing. At some point, I thought it may have been her first time doing this. I considered leaving, but I had already started, and kept asking myself how much worse can it really get? There was no buffering of nails, foot/hand massage, scrub, lotion - the things that make it a worthwhile! I had to ask the woman to file my nails, after cutting them way too short (they are still hurting!) The only positive from this experience, Linda waxed my eyebrows and did a fantastic job!! I definitely do not recommend this place, the best part of it was leaving, knowing I'd never check this place out again!!",0
"I saw one of the np, Kristen, for acne. she was not only rude but also not helpful at all with my acne problem. After reading all the reviews, I feel pretty confident that going to east valley dermatology was a big mistake. After spending hundreds of dollars for nothing, I've finally come to my senses and will look for a different dermatology center. Please don't make the same mistake I made.",0
"I was kicked out recently for standing in the lobby. This coon lady, who worked there, told me that Tower City closed at 7pm and that there was to be no loitering around the front of tower city. It was 10pm and I was waiting for the bus. I said, ""I been waiting inside for years, even after 7pm."" She lies and says that was the policy for the last 3 years, which isn't true. I'm a Cleveland native, been here for over 25 years and you can't tell me nothing about Cleveland. From what I seen, whenever there is a game or big event, the police and people who work in tower city act funny towards certain groups of people. I get tired of people talking about others ""loitering"" or looking ""intimidating"" or ""ghetto"" around public square and tower city. Those are just racist code words, ain't nobody gone rob you or steal. If you scared, keep your ass in the suburbs or go back where you came from.",0
"My pizzas had almost zero sauce, and the crust was like cardboard. The manager Richard was very rude to me on the phone when I called to discuss this problem. He said he was too busy to speak with me, had other customers, did not care about my situation or the fact that I wasted over $20 at this pizza place.  I gave him my phone number and he never returned my call.  Shows how much Fired Pie cares about you once you've already paid.  I did not like his attitude!I did not eat the pizzas and I even took pics as proof.  I told Richard I had pics and he did not care. No refund, no replacement no resolution.  The pizzas were really bad and the customer service gets zero stars.  This guys needs customer satisfaction classes.",0
"First when I walked in, they were standing in the back on there phones. They did not bother saying anything until I asked if they were closed. A girl helped us she was rude, didn't even asked me if I wanted my sandwich toasted. Her coworker was on the phone and keep in my mind he was on it the whole time me and my boyfriend were ordering two subs. I asked for a little bit of mustard and chipotle sauce and ended up tasting only but mustard when I bit into my sub. This has been the worst service I have ever received, I love subway and this service just ruin my experience.",0
"Not bad, marginal service. Never refill the sodas. And if you are with kids and they need ketchup or any condiment, be prepared to fork up 50 cents. First time I EVER paid for ketchup. AND the manager thought that was ok. (By the way, the server never said there would be a charge either)I would rather they said they had none.",0
"Please don't stay at this hotel.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a clean and safe place to stay in Vegas. My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night as we passed through the city on our way to Death Valley.  We reserved our room online several weeks in advance. However, when we checked in, we were told all online reservations were first come first serve and that they weren't able to give us the non-smoking room like we requested weeks earlier.  We were also charged a $25 fee for booking online.  I wish that was communicated to us before we made the reservation.We were given a room in the Manor Lodge, which was news to us as we booked our room in one of the towers.  We had no clue there was even a Manor Lodge! On our way to the Manor Lodge, which is quite far from the main hotel and casino, we witnessed a drug deal in the parking lot, a family almost get hit by a speeding car, piles of dried puke, countless cigarette butts, and a needle.  The parking lot and garage area is quite a scary place and I don't recommend walking alone there at night.  I wish there was a security presence. Upon entering our room, we were hit with an extremely musty smell, like dirty wet laundry.  The edge of the carpets were wet and stained, the walls had stains on them that looked like bodily fluids, none of the outlets worked, the air conditioner was falling out of the window, the sheets had cigarette burns on them, and the shower was riddled with mold.  The room was so dirty that we didn't feel comfortable taking off our shoes.On the door there is a large sign that urges guests to use the deadbolt, however, our deadbolt didn't work.  We heard awkward sounds from a nearby room that would be extremely inappropriate, and quite scary, for a family with children to hear. I've travelled quite a bit cross-county and have stayed at my fair share of bad hotels, but this one has been the dirtiest and scariest place I have stayed at so far.",0
A not so sweet experience. By all appearances this is a great little candy shop located within the OdySea compound in Scottsdale Arizona. You have no choice but to walk past the store to get to just about anything and it's brightly colored with fun gum drops outside. However the candy inside is not up to any level of standard that is except a bowl the taffy is beyond rockhard and probably has not been changed in quite a while. The Caramell's are chewy and again I think that they have been there for quite a bit. Your best bet is to purchase already packaged items from different distributors or manufacturers and not the item they have there in the store because I do not think the turnover is good enough and we were unable to eat even a single piece of a $14 bag of taffy. In addition while the staff was very kind it wasn't until I looked at our receipt on our way back to California on our road trip that I realized I had been charged for two different items twice. So I paid an additional almost $20 that is my fault for not noticing but their fault once I read some of the other reviews where this seems to be a conscious decision. I've are almost $50 bill only two items could actually be eaten and both were produced by outside companies and sealed. Save your money bring a bag of gummy bears from the convenience store down the street and run away from this not so sweet spot.,0
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! I used this company for appliance repair in my home several times and never had a problem. The owner mentioned that they were doing plumbing so when I needed my main line snaked out, I called them. They quoted me $165 to snake the main line. I requested repeatedly that they snake both towards the street and towards my house as we have tree roots that tend to grow through the lines. They ran the snake towards the street once, 45 feet and refused to do anything else. The two men then came into my bathroom and ran the water in my tub for 10 minutes. I thought they were flushing the lines but didn't know for sure as they told me NOTHING. Without my knowledge they decided to pull apart my sink, which at the time was draining. After 20 minutes, they asked my elderly mother to gain access under my home to get to the drain lines. At this point we realized that they were attempting to do work that we didn't authorize, and were padding the bill so we asked them to stop what they were doing. Again we explained that all we needed was to have the main line snaked towards the street and towards our house. They then told us that they could not ""fix our problem"" until they broke up the concrete in our utility room and did approx. $6000 worth of work. We asked them to leave. They charged us $227 and for some reason they didn't have any receipts (that would possibly state what their guarantee for work would be) and used a piece of lined paper to write out the amount. After they left, I found that my tub was pulled apart. The drain access was sitting in the tub and the screw was on the floor. They ruined my stark white bath towel by wiping a black and orange oily substance on it. They also caused my bathroom sink to plug completely. We called the company to complain that they did not do the job requested and left us in worse shape than before the visit. They gave us a $40 refund. I was still not able to do laundry because the drain in my utility room was plugged. I called the company after a week to let them know that the tub drain was backing up again. I figured I would give them a chance to correctly do the work a second time. They told me to ""call someone else."" They offer no warranty or guarantee for the work they (don't) do. I called the company that I normally use (the owner was out of town at the time that I used Richard's Appliance and Plumbing) and he did the job properly. Don't use this company! They are rude, they refuse to do the work you request they do and they will try to talk you into expensive, unnecessary work. I paid twice to have the job done properly and because of the treatment I received by their customer service manager, I will never use that company again!",0
"Walked over this morning (for breakfast )while my car was getting serviced at a nearby JiffyLube.  Door was open, lights were on, and 3 people in the back.  Stood there for 10 minutes hoping someone would take my order.  ALL 3 people made eye contact with me and IGNORED me.  One of the workers eventually came thru the entry door and saw me (again) still standing there.  Him:  sorry we're not openMe:  but the door is open and your lights onHim:  no we're not open.",0
"AWFUL EXPERIENCE! DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY. Called to ask for a ballpark price for some furniture -- the man was so rude! He asked me what I was asking for bedframe, mattress (unused), mirror and dresser ... I simply said I had paid $1800 for the set, to which he laughed and said, ""based on this conversation I will make no money from you, your furniture is not worth my time."" He then proceeded to hang up the phone on me! Such an unprofessional experience!",0
I have been a life long lover of BMW but I am so over the service. My service advisor left and now it is nothing but horrible service. They say they have no loaners they have had my car for 7 days of which I had rent a car and the service advisor John is more concerned about his lunch then getting my car done. So upsetting since cars are amazing! But Audi always has loaners and have heard nothing but amazing things about their service advisors! Maybe it is time for a switch!,0
Save yourself a trip. TERRIBLE service and mediocre food. My eggplant parm was scalding in the outside and cold on the inside/soggy and flavorless.,0
"The place is a dump.  Moved in a couple of weeks ago, lacks microwave, dishwasher has water in it, bathtub drain is plugged, window screen missing, sliding glass door so corroded with calcium from the irrigation system you can't see out, vertical blind pull apparatus broken, some outlets don't work ... so far, zilch has been repaired.",0
"We made a reservation for prom, and we got several confirmation emails saying the reservation is all set. However, on the night of the prom, no one showed up to pick us up. NO LIMO, NO DRIVER!!! Then I called the company to ask what's going on. The owner and staff members are extremely rude on the phone and refused to admit their faults. They didn't even try to solve the issue. The only thing they did is blaming the customers. They said they sent a cancellation email to me, which is obviously not true and I never got the email. So when I asked them to forward that ""not existing"" email to me, they refused to do so. Don't use them unless you're ready to ruin your special occasion.",0
"I would give it a 0 Star if I could. This place absolutely sucks. It smells disgusting, and the chicken is brown on the inside. Would not recommend. Also not a lot of options....",0
"The service absolutely horrible and we thought the food was below average. When we informed the server in regards to our experience, he made excuses. We arrived at 8, and no one took our order for 30 minutes, then we didnt get our food until 910. We wasted two hours at this restaurant. We will not return. I would much rather go to passage of india or guru palace in the east valley. The server actually brought an item that we requested when we were done with our meal, then he turned around and blamed me. Who brings an item at the end of the meal. Very embarrassing. It is a friday night and it was not that busy for a friday night so I don't understand why such bad service. The saddest thing was that the server said one of our items was given to another party because another server picked it up, but then the waiter never came to tell us excuse me sorry we made a mistake, I am taking care of it. Instead, he brought the item at the end when we were ready to leave. There was belly dancing, but we didn't enjoy it because the rest of our experience was below average. The server rarely came to check on us. This place has amazing decor and ambiance and its too bad it was ruined by the service and quality of food. They were also selling indian clothing at the entrance which looked really pretty. Its unfortunate it turned out to be a bad experience here. I usually login here to give excellent review, I believe this is my first absolutely horrific experience. Bland food, bad service, blaming the customer, not taking responsibility, this summarizes our night.",0
"Gross, bland small buffet. We came to Vegas expecting WOW buffets and the circus circus buffet is so disappointing. The chicken fried steak was hard and tasted like it was heated up in a microwave. My 11 year literally spit the baked chicken out and my husband found hair in his gravy. Over $100 spent on this buffet and regret every penny. Dont waste your time or money here, you will regret it as soon as you look at the food. This casino makes alot ofmoney, they really need to invest more into this buffet.",0
"One star for good food. Pulled pork tacos we're tasty, but nothing extrodinary. My cousin had a burger said it was loaded with onions. Which over powered the entire dish. Moth of our party ordered chicken teriyaki bowl. We had a semi large party with separate checks. When the checks arrivers we were forced to tip a certain amount as it was included in our individual checks. (I would have been fine with this if it had been worth the amount charged) It was absurd! Our server could not even bring refills for water in a timely manner. There were people in our party who didn't get their drinks for over 20min! It was not even busy when we ordered or most of the time we were there!! They added one of my cousins items to my check; and I did not want to even deal with it at that point! This place is awful! Our server was horrid and honestly the food was good but nothing special! With such a great downtown Scottsdale location I expected more!",0
"I will never come back here again. I had to get my gold ring re-sized to fit my finger better and had to go down one full size. Naturally, there would be left over gold. I asked the jewelers to give me back the excess gold when I returned to pick up my ring. Well, they did not have the left over gold when I picked up my order. The lady working there said that we should have mentioned that we wanted the excess. Two things wrong here. Who the heck would not want the left over gold from getting a ring re-sized? Dang right I want to extra gold!!! Secondly, we did ask to have the excess gold returned to us when we placed the order. To me, this is stealing and the public should be made aware of this. Now, in my eyes, their integrity is damaged beyond repair and I will never return. Try Schmidt Jewelers instead.",0
"Overpriced and low quality food. My friends and I came here since we wanted to  eat before going out to the city. I had seen this restaurant in passing for years and have been meaning to come here for a while, now I wish I never did.The staff were nice and accommodating and the drinks at the bar weren't the best I've had but it wasn't the worst. The decor was like an upscale diner in Toronto but the food was a different story.I had the Philly Cheesesteak with fries which usually is a safe bet. When the meal came it was a small 6 inch sandwich with fries that weren't really cooked. For $27 this was a huge disappointment, the steak was not seasoned and had no flavor and the cheese didn't  help the sandwich at all. The only way to get through it was to add hot sauce. The only reason you were full was because of the amount of carbs that was on your plate. For $27 dollars I was expecting a good quality and well seasoned steak and was left severely disappointed. This is the type of restaurant were the food sounds good on the menu but when you actually get it, its fails to live up to expectations. My friend got the steak burger which turned out to be dry and unappetizing.Everything on the menu was pricey and personally I believe the prices are only that high because they are located across the street from the harbor 60 the upscale steakhouse in Toronto. If you're looking for a food in Toronto  their are plenty of places to go that are significantly better quality and at a fraction of the cost. I would definitetly not recommend coming here.",0
"So here goes , last Saturday night on 11/14 my partner and I invited another couple from San Diego to join  us at switch for dinner . We gad only been a couple times and the service was good and we really liked the food . On this particular evening we started with drinks as we all like a good cocktail and since we were eating big meals we saw no issue . I admit our one friend was drinking more than the rest of us but he also had a designated driver and no one was being loud or disrespectful , after several drinks our waiter josh came over to cut off our friend from drinking , we were all surprised as we were not given any reason other than the waiter thought he needed to . My friends turned and looked at me since I am a food and beverage manager with Hilton hotels and asked if I would have. Done the same thing. I did say that it's up to the sever/bartender to make the call but there are other ways of making sure the Parton is ok or not , the server josh never came back to talk with us or offer dessert , another employee came to offer dessert which we did order . We thought maybe josh is busy but still no josh , he just avoided us like we all had done something wrong which made us feel quite uncomfortable. I'm sure this server just must be new to the industry but serious to ignore us all , we are all adults and we didn't even give him an issue when he cut our friend off or even ask for another drink for him as we wanted to respect that decision .. Making all of us feel so uncomfortable for the rest of the night was not a good decision in his part. We are very torn about ever going back or recommending switch to anyone again .. We all ate our food entirety even dessert that night and tried to have a good rest of the night talking with one another , as josh would pass by and not acknowledge us . I called him over at the end of the night to give me the check , he barely said 2 words, I just dint understand such behavior from another adult let alone your server that seemed to be pleasant at the start .. At this point we will have to say no to switch and just go to other places for dinner as we don't feel welcome at that establishment any longer , I work at a large Hilton property close by and have told this story to our concierge and we won't be sending any business there way until the owner sends us a very heart felt apology.. Thanks for reading .. Chris C",0
"Honestly, this was a terrible night. A group of my friends and I met at the McDowell Mountain Music Festival tonight and decided to go to FEZ for some food after we left the festival. It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to serve us. When he finally asked for our drink order, 2 out of 6 of us ordered a beer. The waiter left and then five minutes later returned (without our drinks) asking what they were again. After we re- requested our drinks, he proceeded to say that he could tell we had a few drinks, so he was only going to serve us one beer. We were laughing and talking! I had a total of two beers that entire evening! We were all stunned, and frankly completely embarrassed. Never have we been treated in such a way. Let me go on to tell you that we are mid 30's parents having a night out. By no means were we acting out of control. This was a terrible situation and completely ruined our evening to the point that we decided to leave the restaurant and go home for fear that our food would be tampered with since we questioned the waiters decision to cut us off for no reason. Terrible terrible service. I will never be visiting this restaurant again.",0
"WARNING!!! Make sure to check your itemized bill before leaving the restaurant because I got overcharged ~$354.   Also, take note that even though you have items that are ""comped/adjusted"" you will still have to pay the 22% gratuity.  I really hate to do this because I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and have also been a manager, but the 1 star is for how the servers and management dealt with my bachelorette party of 23 people (only 20 people were able to consume alcohol).  I had an issue with my bill and it only got ""somewhat"" fixed after a month of emailing and calling the restaurant.  Here's the story...as soon as we got seated a server told us that we'd be getting a round of sake bombs for free,  I thought, wow that's awesome.  About halfway into dinner my friend said that he was gonna order another round of sake bombs.  I told him to make sure to only order 20 sake bombs because we have people in our party that don't drink alcohol or are pregnant (note: we didn't get carded by our servers which I think is a big no no since we had some guests who had just turned 21 and our servers would have realized that they were handing out supposedly ""comped sake bombs"" to pregnant women). When it was time to pay our bill, I asked our server if she could split it up with food on 1 bill, and alcohol divided by the 3 tables (total = 4 checks).  She kept on telling me that she can't do that because the max number or checks she could do is 4.  I was confused because I was just asking for 4 checks but let it go because we wanted to leave the restaurant already.  I paid the food bill and my other friend paid the alcohol bill.  After we had left the restaurant we were trying to figure out who owed what for the alcohol and realized that Sake Rok had charged us for two rounds of 25 sake bombs (50 sake bombs) even though we had only ordered 20 sake bombs.  And our server did not ""comp"" our first round.  After about a month of emailing management (and not getting a response half the time) I came to the conclusion that our server thought we had ordered a ""set"" menu which includes a free round of sake bombs.  Sake Rok ended up comping the sake bombs in the end but I, the bachelorette, got left with paying the 22% gratuity for the ""comped"" sake bombs (~$66) when we only had a party of 20/23 people that could drink and dealing with all the stress of contacting the restaurant when this wouldn't have happened if our server hadn't made the mistake of, first, not carding us and realizing only 20/23 guests would consume a ""comped sake bomb"" then probably realizing that we didn't order a set menu and had us pay for the bill anyway.  Management offered to reimburse me for the $66 gratuity for the ""comped"" sake bombs but told me it would take awhile because they would have to ask for the money back from the servers, which I think the restaurant should have reimbursed me the $66 without any hesitation.  Sake Rok really needs to make sure they ID all their guests, know how many people are in each party AND if all the guests want/can drink alcohol.  Most importantly make sure that when they offer ""comped"" drinks, that they ""comp"" it.",0
"This is normally the spot I go for frozen yogurt.  I walked in and the guy working was not even in the front, asked if we had been there and then when we said yes, went back to the back.  Not sure if they were just short staffed or what, most the flavors were out or almost out and it was only 345 in the afternoon.  My boyfriend and I decided to leave because there was only about half of theflavors available.  This is annoying as there are many other yogurt places with more flavors to begin with.  If you can, I'd say skip Menchie's and go to yogurtini instead.",0
"I'd give zero stars if I could. Terrible service, and on top of it completely screws up your order. Managers are extremely rude as well.",0
"We have been using this location for years, but things have changed.  We were to receive a double upgrade but we received only a single due to ""unavailability"", but their lot was loaded with cars.We returned the car at the Tropicana location and were charged extra for gas.  That was an error. I called the Paradise office and a young lady there was incredibly rude.  She said, well, it's only $11.25.  It's not enough to argue about so we'll just do it. Argue I asked.  Clearly, she did not believe me when I told her that we dropped the car of with more gas than they gave us,and when I asked to speak to the Mgr., she hung up. I called back and spoke with the Mgr. who apologized and supposedly credited my account, although I never saw it.  My sense is they think the tourists are just stupid. UPDATE:  As requested by enterprise, I contacted them and supplied all information they requested.  On Nov. 6, 2018, i received a second email from Enterprise stating that my issue had been ""escalated"" to management and that I would be contacted shortly. That was 11 days ago.I have heard nothing further and the promised refund of the overcharge never happened.  I checked my credit card account this morning. A reasonable conclusion is that this company is either very dishonest or it is poorly organized and they minimize their training.  This is what is occurring with national companies that embrace poor leadershipSECOND UPDATEI was contacted by the regional manager.  He  apologized and he was sincere and said he authorized the refund for the overcharge. He offered a complimentary rental however I passed.  I can no longer trust the company.  The manager is fine. That is not the issue.  There appears to be no oversight or training. The people at the top set policy, however, the employees in the rental offices are not trained.  I'm happy to pay more and work with a company that reflects professionalism. Know one needs problems like this, especially on vacation.",0
"Find another property company, they are neglegant in doing walk thrus, following thru with tenants etc. They allowed tenants to thrash our property. We were clients for 3 years and they never did their job, followed up or returned calls on time, when we decided to end our contract they did not communicate nor explain the process and they tried to force us to use their maintenance company who did not do their job, even after we paid for it. Save your money and go somewhere else where they value their clients.",0
"One word for you""UNLICENSED""  Do not use this company.  I paid $6500 upfront never given a contract or copy of my receipt. Over priced and the work was horrible.  They showed up every two weeks to drop off a plant or two.  Unreliable, poor work ethics, I feel cheated as well as Naomi.  Run far, do not give them any money.  I am filing a complaint with the R.O.C and I would advise you to do the same.  What he is doing is wrong and illegal.  No one should have to have this happen to them. Get on line and download Unlicensed Complaint Form with the Register of Contractors and stop this from happening to anyone else.  And George, don't bother responding, I will see you both in court!",0
"Wow. Please. I'm doing you a favor. Do not waste your money here.I bet this place will be shutting down less than a year.Wow. I'm just so amazed at $38 all you can eat, self-claimed AYCE sushi place can be abysmal.I'm literally disgusted for their pricing.I'm literally disgusted for their lack of shame to giVE this quality of sushi and take people's money.I didn't even bother to take much of photo. It's really not worth of my phone's battery.I feel sick. Sick. Sick. SICK.Hey, you have been warned!! At the time I decided to go, there was only one review which had 4 stars. Such a lie. But then again if you never had a proper sushi in your life, how can I blame you.",0
"The worst of the worst. Even when you just want something warm to eat, never go here. Eat a granola bar. The terrible food is only overshadowed by the atrocious, wholly apathetic service. Don't do it. Really. It will leave you hangrier than you already are.",0
"I will never come to this place ever again. I'm pretty sad and disappointed about it, as this is a nostalgic place for me to go since I've been coming here when I was little. I ordered my usual, teriyaki chicken rice bowl, and after nearly finishing half of it I felt like I was chewing on a piece of hard flexible scrap. When I spit out whatever it was in my mouth I had realized that it was a dirty black piece of fingernail. At first I thought it was a piece of bone or cartilage from the chicken, but after examining closely I realized what I had just been chewing on and I nearly vomited and vowed to never go back. If I could, I would have given zero stars. However, I guess the one star is that they refunded my money back and apologized.",0
"Did not enjoy any part of my meal. The food quality left much to be desired. Priced at the average AYCE sushi price range, the quality of food were substandard and the selections limited. There was no one part of the meal that stood out, the sushi offerings itself was boring and lacked proper preparation; the rice was unevenly cooked with some grains undercooked. The kitchen food, too, was limited. The only aspect of the restaurant that struck me was their turtle tank in the foyer which kept me quite entertained and dulled to pain of my reluctance to pay the bill. Overall, food taste and quality as well as service were all mediocre, I will not be returning.",0
Went with friends tonight. Worst service ever. We told the server we wanted separate checks. Salad was brought after our meal & several items were forgotten. She didn't separate the the checks & items were on the bill that were not ours. Asked several times to straighten out & still not correct. Manager was involved & finally after several attempts he bought our meal. We didn't ask for this we just wanted the bills right. We will never go back again!,0
This is the most expensive mani-pedi with the least of care / concern.   They need to update their products and colours and better train their staff.   They speak in a different language and eat in front of their clients.   Not worth your time or your hard earned dollars.,0
"Yelp should add a way to give less than one star. This place was wayyyyyy over priced. The food was not good. They serve a pizza with some veggie on it that I literally had to spit out. The desserts were all over the place and nothing really great. The Asian food should be removed all together. The fried rice was ok but that's pretty much it. The staff overall was pretty awesome. The lady who made omelette was a sweetheart as was the guy at the craving station. My waitress kind of sucked. I would not recommend this place. Paris is cheaper and light years ahead, obviously Cesar's is better and planet Hollywood. Step it up Cravings",0
"If you guys close at midnight and someone tries to order food at 1140, don't be rude and tell them ""we have no more food"". Bad enough you run out but the rudeness is not necessary.",0
"Besides walking in and having the whole place smell like a dirty bathroom- when I ordered my blizzard I was told that they were out of cookie dough. You're freaking Dairy Queen! How do you run out of cookie dough?!? In light of the smell and not having what I wanted, I decided not to get anything. In any case, I think I'll drive a little further to go to the South Durango or West Sahara locations and avoid this location at all cost.",0
"I went for dinner with my wife and year and half old daughter. It was complete chaos from the get go. No check in queue, no word as to how long it would take to get seated, and no one at reception. With a busy little girl, the 25 minute wait to get seated was long, after no mention of an extensive wait. The extra hour to get our food was unacceptable, with several empty tables just adding to the irony. We left and took our food to go. It was an unpleasant experience, especially with an infant. Don't eat here... go elsewhere.",0
"Two issues: (1) bugs in the room, and (2) inconsistent service.  The first person I spoke with about the bug issue said there was nothing that she could do.  In fixing the bug issue, the manager emphasized how important customer service was to him and that was the reason he offered me a room that had recently been sprayed for bugs.  The second problem is minor: I asked for a drink that I forgot to grab until I was finishing my breakfast.  The guy was literally locking the fridge when I realized I had nothing to drink.  He refused to unlock it because it was exactly 9:30am - company policy.  The guy seemed angry that I asked; I was surprised he said no.  Although I knew I could ask the manager - and he would just give me a drink - it was just too minor a request to seek out a manager.A place does not have good customer service if only a manager can make a decision.  The staff has to be empowered to fix problems and directed to give good customer service.",0
"I golf Foothills only about four times a year and it's always the same.  As much as I enjoy the layout of the course and the beautiful views, it is very poorly managed.  They seriously need to space out the t times.  In many years of playing here, I've never had a round under 5 or more hours.  I golfed yesterday with some friends and we waited about 7-10 minutes for each shot.  We saw groups of 5 on the course and no rangers.   I'm done!  No more golf here.",0
"First:  I'm already horrified to go to this hospital seeing all the horrible reviews about the delivery unit (i also know someone  who delivered there few weeks ago and pretty much told the same that nurses are rude  and they force you to keep your baby with you all time , even if you request to bring it to the nursery so you can rest . They just simply say they don't have time for that )  especially the anesthesiologist, who's  messing up the epidurals! Second : I have to have an induced labor and they told me to go there at MIDNIGHT ( yes midnight ) and they will do it at 2 am!!!!! why does it take 2 hours to assign you for a bed and etc.. I have no idea! Plus this is ridiculous, to bad I cannot laugh on it, consequence of this I have to drive myself to the hospital  after a super long day, being completely exhausted already before delivering. Oh and of course my husband cannot come with me because he has to watch our kids at home  and take them to school the next morning.  I would choose another hospital if I could , unfortunately I've got this info today , only 3 days before I have to go there.I will update my review after delivering my baby , but let's just say ,this hospital starts from ZERO!",0
"I'm very upset as I'm writing this. I just wasted $50 on something I could have done at home for 1/5th the price. This is the FIRST time I've had a bad experience here and I'm giving this place another chance tomorrow.Paraffin Pedicure - what else is a pedicure for if not to get rid of all the dead, rough skin on your feet? The paraffin was on my feet for like 2 minutes...what will that do?! Apparently not a damn thing. My feet are still rough and it just feels like I put lotion on it. At a price of $35 dollars it was a waste of my life.Manicure - I asked for a french manicure and instead 1. the man who did my nails didn't even CLEAN UNDER THEM!?! and 2. painted the MOST sloppy lines I have ever seen. If you can't do it, at least airbrush them!I'm going back tomorrow, I already sent them an email. I expect this to be fixed for free, no way am I giving them MORE money when I didn't even get my $50 dollars worth. And tomorrow, when one of the women redo it, I will be sure to tip them. I did not tip this sloppy man.",0
"Food was good, service not so much. Our party was seated and waited for forty minutes for the complimentary bread- we had to ask for it four times, while other servers were bringing it to their tables with no problem. Our server was openly hostile and I felt afraid to ask him for anything because he would snap at us. When he was taking our orders after we sat for a half hour, he forgot to take one of my friend's order, like, he just skipped her, and it took is another 20 minutes to flag him down. The place wasn't full at all, yet it took nearly an hour and a half for our food. I ordered the sliders and fries, which were served to me cold. Never once did he check on us. He refused to apply the yelp checkin special of A FREE SODA.  When it came time to pay, he wouldn't split our bill, nor would he charge separate amounts on different credit cards. After some managerial intervention, he finally agreed to charge our separate cards, but he overcharged us $40 total. At this point, we were done with him and just decided to argue the additional charges with the credit card company. If you go to Metro, do NOT be seated in this guy's section (skinny dude in his early 20's, spiky blond hair) unless you want to be served by an openly hostile, incompetent server who will ruin your evening.  And this was the story of how a dinner at Metro Pizza was the most ridiculous THREE HOURS of my life.",0
Incredibly rude hostess... Blonde girl with pink highlights. I will never return there.,0
Terrible service matched by equally terrible tasting food. One person in our group received their meal 30 minutes after the rest of the group. My meal was bland and not worth the money.,0
"TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! North Scottsdale location is TERRIBLE!Two weeks ago I dropped off a LV bag, Tiffany's necklace/earrings/picture frame, and Dior sunglasses. I walk in yesterday evening (6/24/14) at 6pm. I go up to the sales girl and ask about my account and what has sold. I then ask for the price they're selling at and the girl proceeds to tell me outrageously low prices (my $3000 LV is selling for $200 and my Tiffany's is selling for $60!). I told her I want everything taken off and I would gladly pay the $5 for each item. She calls over her RUDE BLONDE MANAGER. My goodness, was she an unpleasant woman! Did not greet me, just came up to the counter with a ""what do you want"" stare. I told her I did not like the selling prices of the items and would like to take them back. In a very condescending tone, she tells me the sales girl read to me the prices that I would be profiting rather than what they're actually selling for. Okay, no big deal, but then she kept going on and making it seem like it was my fault! I then asked her my original question of what they were selling at. She looks at me and says with a snarky tone, ""um ok well I'm going to have to add it up."" Was she too busy sitting on her butt in the back? Anyways, once she calculated all the correct prices that the sales girl was unable do to, I was okay with the prices and did not pull them off the floor. After this experience I'll resort to selling my items on eBay where I will make more money and don't have to deal with old women with ugly attitudes. You cannot pay me to ever shop here!Whoever the owners are really needs to read all of these reviews. LOOK HOW MANY PEOPLE COMPLAIN OF YOUR RUDE STAFF!",0

"This is probably the 10th time in Vegas and our first time at Rio and experienced the worst.  After 2 hrs and 10mins on the wait line to check in we were told that through two bedroom room we reserved was just a ""request"" and not  a guarantee. Thia took another 30 minutes arguing with the front desk agent  who told us they are over booked and  a manager. The manager then promised that they will change us to two bed room tge following day which never happened. The manager at the front desk also told us she is the hotel manager and  the manager of all the hotel and she is the one in charge and noone else for us to escalate. I dont usually go on the Web  and write stuff ... but this has to be known it almost felt like pure discrimination ....I would not recommend this hotel to anyone .. and never again will I stay here. Not worth it what a grief.",0
"WATCH OUT! This place has too many problems to mention them all!  First off, the staff doesn't know how to FAX medical records. Our primary care Doctor was shocked with his experience as well.  Furthermore, they don't mail out invoices unless you ask for them, and if you didn't get an invoice ('cause you didn't even know you had a balance due!) they will send your account to collections. This place is THE most disorganized place I've ever dealt with!  Oh, and don't bother leaving a message for their ""billing"" office, because you will NEVER receive a return phone call!!  I'm going to report this place for unethical business practices!!",0

"Yuk.  A small group of us went there before the Tour de Coops.  Einsteins was packed, so was Duck and Decanter, so we went to Zoes because it was empty, and when we left, we knew why.  Food was grocery store stuff, and the pita had genuine Oscar Meyer ham in it straight from the package.  A place that supposedly professes health stuffs stale pitas with iceberg lettuce and nitrates. Whats worse us that the person at the register acted like we were irritating her.  Like she was busy!  I really regret going and wish I stood in line at any other place in the area.  For $10, I could have bought enough stuff at Safeway to pack 5 of Zoes second rate pitas, including quality ingredients they didn't, or a great meal anywhere else.  Cheesy, bland, corner-cutting and rude.  Dont bother.",0
"Totally disappointed! My husband had some comped cash from playing slot machines so that was really the only reason we went since I had seen bad reviews for the place. We paid $13.99 ea. for the breakfast buffet which consisted of pan cakes, mini-waffles, sausage, eggs. I guess what you would expect but not for the price. There was no variety and it really lacked choices. 15 minutes after getting there they began to switch to the lunch foods. There were probably about 10 -15 items to choose from, of which I only was tempted to try the fried shrimp(best thing they had) and the maniccoti(sp). I would not go back, even with comped cash.",0
They are like robots because they have no human compassion and see everything in black and white.,0
"The location is nice, the service was good, but in my opinion, the food has gone so far downhill I hope never to return. It's not that the food is gross or anything like that, it seems fresh but the flavor is just so blah. My parents and grandparents love it but if you like spicy, flavorful Mexican food this place isn't for you.",0
"This place is so overpriced it's crazy. There are international markets in Phx and Mesa with some of the same products but for 1/2 the price. Not sure what makes them feel like it's okay to charge so much. But let's say even it's okay to be the Whole Foods is the persian stores, at least be clean, everything in the store is so unorganized, things on top of things and there are 3 people working and no one in the store. But yet they are still not organizing. Anyways 3 Rd time we went here and it will be our last. Hope they realize the way they are going forth is gonna cause them to lose a lot of customers. Side note the other day we were in there the lady told my wife here is a coloring stickers for the eggs for Norouz and a small card with some norouz symbols on it. Wife is like sure thinking it's a coupe or dollars each since that is what it is in California where we are from. Then we looked at the receipt 2 things came out to 12 dollars. They has no prices but sometimes you just feel like people try to stick it to you. That lady sure did that to my wife lol anyways fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me!",0
"Horrible customer service. Made an appointment to be seen, waited over 30 minutes while they continued to start other ladies who didn't even have appointments.

He said let me take care of her and I'll come right back, well he was a little heated when he came back you could tell he was upset about it. He ended up taking it out on me and making me feel like he didn't care if he got my business or not cause I wanted to know how the process with them worked, how the waive your deductible works and maybe get an estimate to see what they charged. He said it doesn't matter about your insurance I'll charge them whatever I want and they will pay. I ended up going elsewhere because of this experience I had with the owner there.

"Knowing I was to be in Las Vegas for a weekend, I was attracted to the idea of a ""resort and spa"" a considerable distance from the Strip.  I am a Marriott regular due in part to their international ""no smoking"" guarantee.Well, their Las Vegas Resort did not get the ""no smoking"" memo.  Their casino was every bit as foul as, say, Binion's in 1939.  As far as the ""resort and spa"" is concerned, their pool was closed.  The guy said they close it in winter.  It was 69 and sunny and it was a perfect day to swim -- yet the pool was useless.The ""junior suite"" was a giant room with a TV armoire in the middle.  The TV was old-style and small.   The Housekeeping staff was annoying.   The fitness center cost $25.   Parking close to the hotel was valet-only -- I could not self-park a Porsche.  The valet could not figure out how to lock the car door.",0
Worst subway I've ever been to. Terrible service. The people working did not bother to wash their hands after helping the previous customers pay and making new sandwiches.

"Totally a zero star place. I can't believe this kind of clinic exist. I just needed a quick physical exam and I couldn't make appointment anywhere else. I should've known better. They take walk ins. That just shows you this place isn't really what I think doctor office should be.Very shady looking. Makes you not wanna give them your information...All paper work is printed out from crappy copy machine I can hardly read and some letters are cut off...So far I've been waiting little over 1hour.Receptionist looks super busy, obviously short stuff. Taking 1hour to take my ID copied is a joke. Workers yelling at each other from back to front of the office... Very unprofessional. I guess this is exactly what you expect from this kind of place.Paper work everywhere on desk... Mess.I wish I read yelp review before I came down here.I haven't even seen a doctor yet but it doesn't matter anymore. I'll see her/him for 10min and I'm sure anyone can do exam just fine but overall experience at this point is like negative 3stars:(Seriously. Wait 2month to get an appointment with real doctor would be my best suggestion.",0
"The reasoning I am writing this review is to hopefully save someone else from making the same mistake I made.  I spent the money, then she sent me 2 introductions, neither one contacted me, one I could not reach the other I met be couldn't have been more wrong.  I then waited and waited, then called and she had no idea who I was...wow, really so then she gave me info over the phone of a man, I contacted him and we met, couldn't have been more opposite of what either one of us were looking for, not even close in age, the only thing was he was tall and yes I want a tall man because I am tall.   I gave her money to help me find a special someone, a mate and she didn't know who I was...seriously!  Before and when I actually signed up she said she had a lot of men that would be great for me....yeah, still waiting. TOTAL RIP OFF!  The worst part of this whole thing is, this is personal in the most intimate part of personal, talk about kicking a guy while their down.  I would never have signed up if I knew this is how I would be treated.  Completely rude, disrespectful and wrong!   You open your mind to accepting help in this area and when you are disregarded by the service you employ...how much more of an insult or kick in the gut can it be.  I gave a 1 star but honestly that is too much!",0

"Perfect example of what NOT to do. Mgr takes order but before giving back our change she begins a personal conversation in Spanish to another employee and stands there holding our change for 30 seconds. The girl she was having the conversation with goes back to the food that has now been sitting in the window and just looks at it for at least 2 minutes. She was completely clueless. She just kept looking at the tickets and the food. As more food gets piled up in front of her she just starts handing it out. Our food went to the table across from us and the guy just starts eating it. She gets relieved by a ""chef"" who starts bringing out the rest of the food including the guy who now has our foods order. The chef sees me looking at him and I can hear the conveesation. He goes back to the window and asks for our order to be remade quick again in spanish. Of course they make it wrong and we send it back. They finally bring our food. It is thrown in the bowl with no care. The veggie were cold and not cooked. The onions raw and had a black powder on them. I suspect a dirty wok. They knew I knew they had made mistakes  because I was watching them the whole time but they didn't address it they just dropped the food at our table and took off. I use to love eating there but I can say that I will not be going back any time soon",0
"Customer service and communication were abysmal. I ordered a gift card for a present and never received it. I never received an email from the company either. I called seven different times, and each time I was assured the problem would be fixed, I was asked to give it a few more days, and it would be fine. Eleven days later, and still nothing. I kept calling, and everyone kept passing me off, telling me the manager was not in. Finally I spoke to the manager, and was told the problem would be solved that afternoon. When it wasn't, I finally asked for my money back. I would never go to this spa if this customer service experience is any indication of how they run their business. Consumer be warned.",0
"Pretty $#!++¥...I'm definitely used to 'other' hotels. I'll just bullet point the issues that occurred:* No air in my room yet somehow there was air conditioning in the hallway...* Restrooms on first floor were out of service the entire time I was there* No parking when I requested it a day ahead of time* Saw a squirrel eat off of an empty plate on the patio. Can we say rabies plates?* Hair continuously in bathroom after housekeeper cleaned * Hair & stains on towels * Bedding with ink stain* Bugs on wall near non-working air conditioning control* Nasty stains on chair in room* Bed sheets were low-grade & itchy* Bedding wasn't changed for 2 days* Room didn't have a safe. That's standard in hotel rooms. First one I've encountered without one.I do believe I've entered 2 star territory & that is not my scene. Definitely got lied to by booking.com...Only thing that was okay? The breakfast, but that was suspect too when I saw one of the staff putting bread & muffins away without gloves. They were just at the front desk handling office supplies. I didn't see hand washing occur inbetween. I was appalled & grossed out. Thank god it was only a place to rest my head & I was out all the time. Ugh...",0
"WARNING - COCKROACH INFESTED HOTEL!!There was a quarter size cockroach in the living room and another one on  my baby's bed, next to his head! When I told the front desk, the manager was not shocked and said she could only credit my account for another Diamond stay.  She continued to tell me ""We've been treating for cockroaches for the last 2 months."" OMG, anyone knowing putting their guest in INFESTED rooms to bring back to their own homes. DISGUSTING.",0
"This was our second time here. Unfortunately this time we arrived at 10:40 PM and they refused to seat us since they closed at 11 PM. The host said that they stop seating 15 minutes before they close and just shrugged his shoulders when I pointed out that it was 20 minutes until they closed when we arrived. The food was good the first time, but the service was bad. It seemed like kind of a conveyer belt where you were expected to sit down, order, eat, pay, and leave. Definitely not fine dining. But it was good and we wanted to go again tonight, but I guess the kids decided they wanted to go home early.",0
No hello .. No menus .. Goodbye ... People who came in after us received menus.  Diners in NYC are friendlier.  Be Nice or Leave .. Bull!,0
This business does not have an address. Impossible to locate via google maps. Apparently does not exist. I looked behind the dentist's place and nothing was there. So you better call before in order to confirm the address and confirm if they're still in business,0
"Absolutely horrible experience at this location today. I walked in the door there at 12:50 pm, finally got to the counter to place my order at 1:02. The poor girl Brittney was the only one on the counter with a huge line of people. Not sure what happened or the confusion, but some how orders were being wiped off the screen to show who's order was next. Another manager lady apologized to the 20 of us waiting. We all had to individually go back to the counter to confirm our orders. I got to the counter and my food at 1:30. I understand it was lunchtime but had i actually been there on my lunch break, i would have been more angry than I was. Fast food should NOT take 50 mins to get. I will NEVER go back to this location again.",0
"When I got there, I waited for 10 mins to place an order. Couple of waitresses even looked at me while I was waiting and there was no acknowledgement.I ordered Chicken Chowmein and when got home, found exact four little pieces of chicken. Not worth $10 after taxes.I am sorry first impression was the last impression, not going back there again.",0
"I've tanned at this location for over 5 years. In the last year it got awful. The stand up beds got recalled which I understand is not their fault. But the music never working is. I upgraded from level 2 to level 4 just so I could use the bed with built in music controls. Wouldn't you know that after using it once, it broke. So there was a month upgrade waisted. Then to address the music issue they were nice enough to upgrade me to level 3 ( there's one bed with built in music which is great) until the music issue was fixed. Once the music was fixed I was back to my stand up level 2 and music but I don't call muffled bass with no volume music. The place is a disaster it's always something.  So after 5 years I just canceled my membership and no one even cared to ask why.",0
"The place is dirty, tables are not cleaned properly on top or underneath them. The help is not throughly",0
Came in here from out of town to check the place out. Never met a more rude man in my life working there. I was with an autistic kid who asked him about the wheat. He asked him what the hell he was doing. He told him he didn't have time for this and told us to go to the park across the street. There was nobody in the store. I will never ever be returning to this place and will be letting everyone I know hear about this. I never want to return to Paoli after this experience and hope this business is not open long.,0
"People are terribly rude and unwilling to help. Management is all over the place, and the Internet sucked. We stayed for three days and we had wifi just one day.",0
"Worse tasting chicken I've ever had. All 3 variety a are cold, dry, old, and awful tasting. Don't know how this place is even a KFC.",0
"NEVER AGAIN.I went here for a friend's birthday, and we were a party of 9, so I can understand some difficulty there, but our group has been used to fine dining establishments and knowing myself, I always try to save the waitstaff the stress of tending to a large party.Believe me, I've waited on large parties before- our group wasn't difficult.  A couple with a baby is already difficult, but we are all adults here.Let me skip over the decor because I should've regretted the moment that I entertained the thought of dining with cars next to me.  I don't care if they're Murcielagos- the service and the food was still horrendous.Believe me, I wouldn't skip over the good parts if there were any but to tell you the truth, there were none.  Maybe the hostess- she was pretty.But the food was nothing special.  I didn't get an appetizer because I didn't feel like it, so I got a dish with clams.  They were undercooked.  The server kept telling me they were cooked, and I told him to taste it because it was cold inside.  Just because they are open, according to popular belief, doesn't mean they are cooked.  That just means they're dead because the muscle holding it open isn't functioning anymore.So then I ordered a fettuccine dish.  They came out with ravioli instead.  That was the second mistake they made on my dish.  My friends ordered a ravioli dish, and there was only 5 pieces.  Waste of money.The servers and bussers were inattentive, and they seem to be all hired through friends and hook-ups.  This is alright- it makes sense to managers to hire people who they trust, but it seems that the staff has gotten too comfortable.I didn't leave a tip- I never leave a tip at establishments where the staff or the chefs/cooks themselves make crucial mistakes.  Maybe it was just a bad evening there, considering there are quite a few good reviews on this place.But anyways, I went to the giftshop upstairs after dinner and got myself a bottle of Fiji to flush down the salmonella-ridden pasta.. if you call it pasta.  Best $4 I spent that evening, even though it was on overpriced water.Eat at Lavo instead- the food there is a tad better and there's actually well-trained servers there.",0
"Taylyn C at drivethru is the rudest little biotch ive ever seen. She threw the bag at me and said ""Here!""... I then asked for ketchup she threw those in too. I snatched the bag drove off then immediately called Brandon the mgr. Another mgr answered and apologized.  What a POS this place is!",0
I'm gonna make this short... took my 2015 Dodge Ram in for a anti freeze leak got the truck back 4 days later and 400 dollars less in my pocket only to get the truck home to find out my 300 beats head phones where stollen from the truck and the anti freeze leak was still there. Took the truck back and was told that a new anti freeze leak had appeared and it would be another 400 dollars to fix it. In my opinion they made an unnecessary repair the first time and instead of admitting there mistake they made me pay twice for one repair.,0
Hot dish water. Save ur money. Worst place I have been in a long time. Girls were so busy chatting and being cute they forgot to make a drink worth selling. Poured it out...,0
"Horrible, never coming back. I tried to explain what I wanted and she end up doing what she wanted. And when I was trying to explain she will talk in her language to avoid me. So I paid $51 dollars for something I didn't want.",0
"Do not take you community cats to the Animal Foundation for the free spay/neuter program.  It was wonderful when Best Friends was running the program but it has now been turned back over to AF to run and they are terrible.  Took a feral cat there I had trapped to get spayed and told them 3 times that I would pick her up and release her back to her colony.  They never called so went up there on Saturday and they said she was still there and recouperating from her spay surgery.  They said someone would call Sunday to let us know when she could be picked up.  No one called so I went down there only to find out they couldn't find her and that she was ""probably released"".  Well she is not back at her colony and they could care less .. NEVER AGAIN USING ANIMAL FOUNDATION... they lie and could care less about the community cats",0
"Waited 20 minutes, never waited on. Got up and.left. Saw others do the same. Terribly understaffed and no manager in sight. Stay away",0
Sharp pains in my head and my teeth is aching after getting fillings Today 2/9/15 my head is throbbing will not go away. I dont know how long the pain is supposed to last I went to Dr Hyung for the 1st time for a teeth cleaning they took Xrays and said I need 6 fillings 3 on right 3 on left. As they added the filling I could see the reflection of them working off the light above me. I already had fillings from my previous dentist. It looked like they took out the old filling and put in a new filling. after the 3 fillings the dr drilled 3 more holes in my teeth and added filling.  The other 3 cavities was supposed to be on the left side of my mouth. No work was done to the left side of my mouth. I asked them to show me where is these other 3 cavities on the xray? But they said you cannot see them you can only see them by looking at the teeth.  Its ben 8 hrs and Iam in alot of pain I think I hope to feel better in the morning.,0
This is more like DOG FOOD!!! I ordered for the first time tonight and it tasted like it had half spoiled ingredients mixed in with fresh.  I am praying my little girl does not get sick from the shrimp she tried before I could taste it. it tasted bad.  DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.  A waste of $50!!! Hopefully we will feel okay tomorrow.,0
"If it was possible to rate a place 0 stars this would be the place. Nothing about this place was good. The wait staff was terrible, the food was horrible and over priced.  The most memorable part of the meal was getting this worse then Safeway or Costco pre-made sushi which i think i paid close to 12 bucks for. The calamari was like calamari steak fries, tough, and luke warm.  There was nothing good to say about this restaurant. The Paris Hotel, is a fabulous hotel and i love staying there. But if they do not do something about this restaurant i may boycott this hotel!!",0
"Food was pretty gross especially considering the price. The salad was soggy, the chicken was dry. Typical yorkville overpriced food with subpar quality.",0
"A $20 minimum on debit cards is absolute crap. Especially considering it is a college town bar. Also, not allowing open tabs?? Shouldn't have a minimum then. Horrible service by the bouncers and bartenders as well. Never going back.",0
"Normally enjoy breakfast here but not this time.   Slow service and the food was just not good.  The worst part was nobody seemed to care.  We were headed to another place but changed our mind.  Big mistake.  I can deal with ok food when people are concerned and try to make things better.     The owner needs to take a serious look at his/her operation.  And clean up the restroom, it's definitely been overlooked.",0
"The service department is not efficient nor thorough. I always have to double back for the same issues because they don't listen and actually correct things. I send my husband instead thinking it will help and he agrees, they're disorganized and don't listen. I'll never purchase another Volkswagen. The managements generic auto reply given to my initial review is evidence they don't take anything seriously either. They all suck.",0
Ok.  The tacos came to the table  with cold meat. Isn't the restaurant called Hot Taco?  Seem to have temperature issue with all sides and  other food except with my husband steak fajitas.  That came out super hot.  Waiter was good and attentive. Atmosphere seems more bar like in evening and parking is hard to find. They have parking lot attendant charging too on weekend when we came.,0

"I will not do dinner here ever again. They do great breakfast. Tonight the food was not up to par. Potatoes were cold, chicken fried steak was lukewarm, onion rings were almost cold, when I received my salad I ordered blue cheese and it came with tartar sauce instead. Come to find out they did not have any blue cheese someone labeled the container wrong. Server never came back to fill out drinks. We were informed that they were shortstaffed but that was no excuse for the lack of service we had tonight.",0
Yes they have lost some quality- certain of the Fry's stores actually compete! AJ's get with the program -- the original is still the best!!!,0
"Double fees on all  overdrafts and extra 12 dollars for each day account is overdrawn.  So if you overdraw one day and don't notice it until the next day....new fee.Also, if your account is overdrawn, your debit card will still work...so they can charge you overdraft fees.  The people in the bank are very friendly and professional but its the exact opposite when you call in.Bank here at your own risk.",0
"Stopped there today excited to try something indigenous to Native North Americans/Ojibway. I have never had anything like that and really wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was microwaved canned chili and sour cream. I am fairly certain such food as that is not representative of First Nation people. My advice to Pow Wow is to serve food that is indigenous. I would have been thrilled to have something like that. Also you should make some effort to do away with all the flies in the ""restaurant""The more I look back at that experience the more repulsed I get thinking that I actually invested some of that crap.",0
"The service at this location is horrendous. The service is not good at all, whenever I come up to order, the cashiers always give attitude, make you feel like you're bothering them, and are never pleasant. On one of my visits in the past, I was sitting at a table and the worker there asked me to move to a different table so a larger party could sit there. I've been to many restaurants and I've never been asked to move to a different table to accommodate someone else. Also, this location closes at 10:00PM on Thursdays, today however, at 9:15PM they decided to lock one of the entrances. At 9:25PM they shut off all of the lights in the restaurant, and at 9:30PM, the employee asked me to leave even though this location closes at 10:00PM. I asked her what time this location closes and she said 10:00PM, but they wanted to close early since there are not very many customers left. I found this very unprofessional, won't be coming back.",0
"Location great, food superbBar service stinks They have a bartender by the name of Angie, that negotiates and sells the seats at the bar, even though Peter , one of the managers personally confirmed to me that seating at the bar was first come first serveThat bartender was rude, and out of place, very bullishWhen I complained to Peter the manager, his remedy was a couple of free glasses of merlot.I didn't complaint to get free wine , but for other patrons not to have to go thru the humiliating moment that Angie, the bullish bartender made me go thruEvidently they have  some rotten employees",0

I'm not use to getting an examination by someone 'looking' at my breast and 'looking' down below.  Weird.  And I've had cancer and have a huge family history of cancer.  It took two phone calls to get a examination changed and then it still wasn't right....  and I held forever the first time I called!

"While the end result was very nice, the process to get there was excruciatingly difficult and required micromanagement from us. Had we not done so, I am confident the end product would not have been as nice as we prevented them from cutting multiple corners.  If you don't have time to micromanage them, I would think twice about using them.  The sales department will promise the world, but most of what is promised can't be delivered. 1) Was told our project would be a 5 week project.  This was a big project with a complete backyard remodel, building a ramada, etc.  But they assured us it was no problem.  We engaged CA pools in March with hopes of having it finished in May in time for a party at the house.  Project sat idle until late May and the final completion walk through was not done until October 28th (6 months after the initial engagement).2) At the onset we were constantly told that CA pools was waiting on the City of Scottsdale to approve the project.  Turns out that CA pools never submitted anything to the City until late May.  When they did, it was approved in 24 hours.3) We were promised all employees working on the project would be directly employed by CA Pools and that everyone would speak English so we could communicate with the employees.  Not the case.  Every part of the job was outsourced to contractors.  We got broken English at best.  In many cases the contractors did not have the most up to date drawings so we could not communicate with them that what they were doing was not correct.    4) The landscaping crew shut of the water to the front yard killing a lot of the plants.  We had to battle with CA Pools to get them to replace the plants.  When they finally did, they did not replace them all and the ones they did replace were replaced with very young, small plants vs the fully mature ones they killed.     5) Lack of pride in workmanship.  On several occasions we had to ask the question 'really, this is a work product your proud of?'.  Granted, they repaired and redid poor workmanship - but only after we called them on it.6) Read the fine print!  In many cases, the fine print countered things they promised us at the onset.  As the project advanced, they relied on the fine print vs what we had discussed.  For example, we struggled to get them to replace new plants that did not live.  The last straw was recently when we did get them to agree to replace some plants.  They replaced a dead ocotillo with a dead ocotillo - then told us that they are not contractually required to do anything about it. In reading the reviews, it appears that they are probably good at simple, straight forward projects (e.g., resurfacing a pool).  But if you have a complex, highly involved project I do not believe they have the capability as an organization to handle it.",0
they should limit # tickets to be sold and have id's shown at the door,0
Went here for a friends birthday party.  Will never go here of my own choice.  The food is edible.  I believe the prices are ridiculous.  You actually have to pay more money to have fries with your burger really????  All food orders went in at same time but all came out of different times.  The last 2 plates coming out over an hour and a half after ordering.  Took 30 minutes to get a simple salad.,0
No clue how this place is rated 4.5 stars. Hair in my pho. Awkward staff that watch you eat. Can I please just enjoy my food in peace please? Colleagues ordered panang curry which was mediocre. Definitely won't go back and stunned by the reviews.,0
Been stood up 3 times and it takes sometimes over a week to receive a return phone call. Their voice mail always has a message that is over 2 months old. They do a decent job if they show up but their customer service is awful and they never show up. I can't waste any more Saturday's waiting around for them to just not show up.,0
"Got a tattoo done here when I was naive and 17. I still like the content of my tattoo and don't regret that, I just regret going here. Whoever did my two words, ""Live Louder"", charged me $180!!! She explained that it was on the ribs, so it was harder to tattoo, which I understand but if you're a skilled all around artist, you should know how to easily tattoo on something as common as the ribs. Then, they had a list of prices for ""people in the area that can't afford tattoos"". Way lower prices for people who shouldn't get tattoos in the first place if they can't afford it? What if I lived in the area? Anyways, the woman kept getting frustrated that I wanted to adjust the placement to be straighter. Total, these TWO WORDS, the whole thing is MAYBE two inches long, took an hour to do. She spelled ""live leuder"" and thought she was done until my mom pointed it out. Then, the ""er"" curve upwards and it's not straight. She did not follow the cursive and did it way too thick. Her machine kept squirting out ink and the shop owner refused to help her. Over charged me for a bad tattoo.",0
"I went to True Rest last night. You float in these pods in highly concentrated purified water with tons of salt. OMG! You have your own room and shower. So put in your silly putty earplugs, shower off, with shampoo and body wash provided, then get in the pod that has 10"" of salt water, close the hatch and float. They pipe in calming music for an hour! Then shower off, change, use their lotion, deodorant, qtips, and hairdryer. Then go into the resting room and use the oxygen bar with either lavender, lemongrass, orange, peppermint or eucalyptus while drinking water or organic tea! They have salt rocks everywhere and even a salt room for salt therapy. I felt so great after that float. It's scientifically proven to help with all sorts of ailments! Look them up and read everything. It's amazing. I felt calm, no pain, taller and just in a great place. Some of their clients are famous athletes! It's a 7' pod and very wide. The owner is very nice, personable and knowledgeable. She said that doing the neuropathy treatment and floating, I'll be in a better place soon. So I'm feeling pretty good right now! Mind, body and soul. Gotta keep this going...8/11/18 UPDATE: My health has gotten worse. Had a stay in the hospital for four days last month due to falling episodes and one where my body went into full convulsions. I'm having many more tests done as the doctors aren't sure what's wrong. Possible MS. I'm now in a wheelchair and can't drive let alone walk. I asked True Rest to stop my membership, which they did, but they won't refund my money or refund the current floats that I have on file. They told me that my family and friends can use my floats if I can't. I had mentioned that I may need to seek help at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, AZ. They had the audacity to tell me that they have five clinics down in Phoenix to use the floats! WTH? Do they have no empathy? I need that money back for doctor visits but they refuse to refund my money. Shame on you for not being understanding and compassionate. Warning to all others! Do not use True Rest if your health takes a turn for the worst as they won't refund anything!",0
"This place is filthy. Osmow's frequently shows up on dineto for infractions relating to poor hygiene, not storing food properly, etc. The staff don't wear gloves, and you have the pleasure of watching them touch their face, nose, phone, and anything else while making your food. The chicken shawarma sandwich was awful. Not fresh at all. All of the sauces hide the low quality ingredients. Only come here if you are looking to get sick.",0
"When we first moved here in 2014, I found this dental office. Everything was great back then from the receptionist up to the dentist. Year 2016 I scheduled an appointment for my son's regular dental cleaning. I did update our paperwork work (receptionist took a copy of my insurance Id)since we have a new insurance. The old male dentist told me that my sons teeth was totally messed up that is why he needs to deep clean it. During our conversation my baby suddenly cries and he told me that he cannot deal with me with a crying baby and left me hanging in the hallway...How rude!! Then a lady called me up to her desk and started her calculations on what I have to pay. Total for deep cleaning was $560. My copay was $205. After paying I went out  and waited for my son. Not even 30mins my sons was already done. My son told me that the dentist just gave him a regular cleaning. I was so pissed off. Fast forward..After 6 months I received a call from their corporate/main office that I still have an outstanding balance amounting to $165. The guy told me that they offer payment plans and if I want to pay in cash or credit card. He even mentioned that it was not covered by my insurance. I called the corporate office and the dental office for 2 consecutive days to make sure they forward the bill to my new insurance. Next thing you'll know, they charged the wrong insurance that's why the bill was not processed. I was totally mad and even told the office manager that I did my part in updating my insurance info and still your trying to harass me that you will send it to collections. I told them to better fix it. I will never go back to this dental office again!",0
"I see the management has not posted here yet.....apartmentratings.com has been padded.  I feel the property is starting to look better but the community is a bit rough.

Police have been here a lot lately, we even made the news for a meth house explosion! I cannot wait to move.",0

Liars....bought a suit from them and it kept ripping at the butt. When I bought the suit they told me it was a top of the line suit only to be told later that it wasn't. After ripping three time I took it to Jabbours Clothing-Stow where it hasn't ripped since. I also bought a sports jacket at same time. I was told they would make any alterations for free at anytime. Took it on to be told I had to pay...I would rather pay Jabbours Clothing-Stow. They provide better service then Mens warehouse. Your replying now...you should have listen the many times I came into the store...instead your associate didn't care..he already made the commission off the money I spent and left me with no options or the willingness to fix the issue. Instead he blamed the suit ripping on me ...umm sorry your company was the one that did the alterations and I only wore the suit once...Jabbours clothing has already fixed the issues that you weren't willing to fix and proving far better customer service,0
"Wow this place has gone downhill. We are locals, and used to go here often. Haven't in about a year. Now we live close by, and we were excited to be near it again.  Just left there, after having a terrible dining experience. Arrived at 840. Place was not busy at all, but no one served us. We had to finally get someone's attention for water. 15 minutes later, had to beg someone to take our food order. Also, Ordered a martini, it was awful and watered down. We ordered a gin and tonic, got a gin and water, sent it back, and we still got charged for it. We ordered a glass of Moscato, and was told they were out of moscato. We ordered a lump crap cocktail, and we were told they were out of those too. We were basically being ignored. Food took over 40 minutes to arrive.  After 30 minutes we complained to management, and they basically shrugged their shoulders. Our lobster pan roasts finally arrived, and they were blah and tasteless. Check arrived, no compensation for the bad service. $85 lesson learned. Will not return.",0

"Don't SELL here!!! GO ELSEWHERE!! Too much to go in to but the most despicable was this: in consideration of comparative pricing on other furnishings, they grossly underpriced a well-upholstered, flawless, excellent condition custom-made 72+ inch chaise lounger. THEN, No more than 14 days later it was sold on a day they happen to be having a 20% off sale. I wanted to reclaim my remaining items but couldn't find them anywhere in the store.

"I have banked with B of A for thirty years. Their handling of POA and POD  matters through their incompetent and untrained bank tellers and their estate division in North Carolina verged on violation of every banking rule in the industry. Their branches are run down and understaffed. Recently Square sent them $2400 in receipts from my artshow and the deposits were misrouted to someone else's account. In spite of my diligence in notifying them and providing them with an ACH trace number, they claimed they could not find the money and, even if they could, privacy interests of that account holder trumped my right to reclaim money to which I was entitled. Presumably the same result would occur had the receipts been $100,000. Their so called consumer protection regulatory division are just inexperienced and loyal bank subordinates.I will be filing a lawsuit and changing banks shortly. Please think about it  before banking with these idiots, especially if you are opening  a business account. My experience with them has been miserable nationwide, from Los Angeles to Austin.",0
"I have been excited to try this place for a while, because... beer.  I was excited that there was no wait during peek dining hours on a Saturday night. Hooray! That should have been my first clue. First, The service was not so great. We waited quite some time and as I mentioned it,  was not so busy. The menu item I tried to order came with slaw, which was recalled. Which is fine,  but the server tried to gloss over it and offered me fries and tots or a salad for an up charge. Cool. I'll take the salad, even though it took a lot of digging on my part to finally be told, ""yes, it comes with a slaw, but it's recalled which is why I offered you tots and fries.""The salad comes out after we've already eaten. Then the server returns... and we are discussing the option of staying for another drink and and she doesn't acknowledge that she heard us as we had planned to order different beers, so when she returns we ask for our check since she didn't take our new beer order. She returns with our check.... and you guessed it, two beers we didn't order. I mentioned she hadn't acknowledged she heard us discussing another drink and we hadn't planned on ordering the same beers. She replies, ""it's on your check.""  Cool. Thanks. Guess I know why it isn't that busy. ... and the food is meh. But as I sat here silently seething, she did come by and finally ask us if we wanted a different drink. But at this point I was already dreaming of OHSO.",0
Crappy service. Sooooooooo slow. Took us 40 minutes with 3 people in front of us in line. And super expensive. $9 for a medium (which is about 1 cup).,0
Absolutely terrible service. So disappointed got a car wash my car was barely dirty just needed washed off. Paid the $9 for the medium wash went through and my car came out exactly as it was. Went inside told the lady I've been here multiple times I know how yours works and she said grilled me about how I should have bought the most expensive. Umm excuse me? I wasn't asking for it to be hand washed and detailed but damn the dirt and dust would have been nice. Needless to say she gave me a code for a cheap rewash. My car still looks like it did and I had to deal with her rude ass. I will not be getting gas or car washes here anymore. Sad day,0
The burger and fries overly dripped grease and tasted like grease. Not good; never going back.,0
"I was just trying to order on line large pizza and they have spacial  large pizza $7.99 with $2.00 extre for stuff crust with the total of $9.99 and we were not able to place our order because our order was 0.01 ( penny) short. We called the store and spoke to Augusto and he said we can't place on line order because of 0.01 short. I ask to speak with store manager but it took him more than 10 min to let me speak with assistant manager Nicol ,she was no help instead she was so rude to me,her answer was she had other customers to help and she hang up phone on me. If this kind of service this store is giving I don't know how they will stay in business. Very poor customer service",0
I came to this location looking for a certain product that I had already verified was in stock on line by a chat representative. The person online specifically said they had 10 in the color that I was looking for and only this location had them. I went out of my way to drive 30 minutes out only to find that they had none in stock. I asked more than 5 associates for help and every single one was very vague and unhelpful. I will never be coming back to this location. Not only was I completely misinformed that didn't bother me as much but the bad customer service was uncalled for.,0
"This sucks! We've gone from twice weekly service to once every Wednesday and every other week for bulk..that's fine but when they don't even come the one day they're supposed to, creates a funky atmosphere in the neighborhood...Fix this shit or we will start dumping it in the streets! DUNEVILLE, WESTWIND, REDROCK, DOE, AND ALL THE OTHER STREETS IN THIS AREA!!!",0
Haven't been there in years.  Food is okay but don't try to substitute anything. A big no no.  Not sure if Michael is still there.  He was rude. Disappointing.  Atmosphere good.,0
Drinks were too light. We really questioned if any at all. Our group of ten didn't get any good mixed drinks. We had to switch to beer and wine to make sure we got what we were paying for. Slow service for a Friday night. Looked cool but not worth the money for crap drinks.,0
"We have been taking our 3 girls here for over 3 years and have always been pleased until this last illness.  I went in saying ""think outside the box, this is not the normal back problems"" for my Chiweenie.  Well, we did the normal x-rays and bloodwork. She could not hardly walk, wasnt eating or drinking and obviously in pain.  She was put on 4 medications and we were told to wait.  There was no progress for over 2 weeks and I was trying to come to terms on letting her go at almost 9 years of age.  Went as far as taking off work to put her down.  We waited a few more days and as I was holding her up to go to the bathroom I notices a worm.  Called immedietly and left message as normal, got a call an hour later and was told that to come get meds the next day.  I went on lunch break after calling and was told it was ready and it wasnt of course but took the meds to her and gave them.  By the time I got home it was obvious why she had been suffering from the deworm meds.  By Friday afternoon she was almost normal.  I called and left a message commenting about them not giving her a fecal on June 11th, this was on the 27th and never heard back from them.  I have since switched vets of course but feel I need to warn others.  They do not answer the phone, it is obvious while you are waiting, they do not check about your pets and they do not start with the simple less expensive test, my girl suffered 3 weeks unfortunetly.  I almost lost my girl because of their neglect.  Remember, I said at the beginning to them, this is not normal and a $15.00 ish test would have proven me right before the $362.00 xrays and expensive bloodwork and medications.  She is healthy and happy now thank goodness.",0
"It's taking HOURS to check in!!! They got like 20+ registers but only 3 of them are working, while 50+ people wait in queue to check in. THIS IS MESSED UP! It's my first time with this hotel and it's horrible until now.*I'll update the review about the room etc",0
"Interesting experience at this location.  On July 6, 2013, I took my car in to have the breaks checked for possible replacement.  I was told it would be a while, so I left my vehicle.  After around an hour or so, I called back to inquire.  I was told by Ben ""I'm working up an estimate for you and I will call you back shortly.""  Okay, 10 minutes later, I receive a call from Ben advising me that I need brake pads all the way around and my front rotors must be replaced.  I immediately inquired as to whether the rotors could be resurfaced.  I was told no, they are too thin.  Ben then quoted me a rate near $500 for this work. To his quote, I responded no and requested that he put my car back together, as I am coming to pick it up.  Ben then offers to put the brakes only all the way around for $200.  Again No, ""put my s@!t back together!""  I call the Nissan dealer and inquire about the same type of work and was quoted $310 for new rotors on the front and brakes all the way around.  I pick up my vehicle from Ben and drive it down the street to the Nissan Dealer.  While there, the mechanic asked if I could wait to allow for a full inspection.  I agreed.  Approximately 30 minutes, or less, later the mechanic emerges and asks why I though I needed all this work.  I explained the above and he laughed and said ""No"".  ""You will not need brakes for a while and the rotors in the front are only slightly bent.""  The mechanic offered to resurface my rotors and deglaze the brakes for $100.  Yes BLANK STARE.  The mechanic proceeds to explain that my brakes are a 6 in the back and a 5 in the front.  BLANK STARE AGAIN.  At this point, I'm thinking ""I'm going to Yelp them.""  Long and short, I will never use Meineke again because apparently their practice is to offer repairs that are not needed and that are over priced.  I wish I had gotten a written estimate from Ben because I would have certainly uploaded of photo of his listemate, I mean estimate to this Yelp..  That is extremely unethical.  I do not advise anyone use Meinke for their car care needs, even if it is only an oil change.",0
"Placed my order late in the evening asked for a phone call so as not to wake my roommate. What does the guy do but ring the doorbell at 1215am. Pizza was suppose to take max of 45 minutes to be delivered took over an hour, which is ridiculous since I live less than 2 blocks from this establishment. Pizza wasn't hot nor did it have very many toppings on it. I tried calling to check on my order and had no answer. This was my first and last experience with this place. Very disappointing.",0
"Service was Terrible, couldn't modify one of orders cus it was ""new"" to the menu and she was rude about it.",0
"Really, Really, Really BAD! The BBQ Beef brisket sandwich was so tough it couldn't be chewed. They replaced it with the pulled pork when the waitress verified that all the beef in the kitchen was that bad! The pork was like soup. Watered down pork soup with BBQ sauce on it. YUCK. Then there was the fried chicken. The chicken itself was good, once the huge chunks of bland batter were peeled off.  I like fried chicken as much as any Georgia girl, but this was just plain terrible. OK, I could go on about the ""straight from the freezer"" fish and chips, but you get the picture.Now the service: The waitress was friendly and got a good tip. The manager was very transparent in her attitude that we were trying to get a free meal out of it. Nope. Just looking for some decent food and Bill Johnson's is the wrong place. Breakfast might be better, but I don't have anymore effort to waste finding out.",0
"I wanted to love this place because it had such great reviews! I did not have a 5-star experience. I had just had surgery, and coming here was my first big outing, which I told the woman who did my pedicure. Despite her saying to let her know if I was physically uncomfortable, she kept instructing me to get into positions that hurt my incision during the procedure and couldn't seem to work around my physical limitations. She also took a weird joy in how badly my feet needed some pampering (I had, of course, just had surgery and couldn't reach down to my feet for weeks). She kept mentioning how gross my feet were, and at the end of the session, she actually picked my dead skin off the floor and threw it in the air like confetti! It made me extremely emotionally uncomfortable in addition to my existing physical discomfort. I realized after I got home that she didn't use top coat. Two nails chipped the next day and the rest started to go as the week went on. I felt so humiliated the whole afternoon, and even if I'd had the color, I couldn't even reach down to fix my toes myself. I'm still sad I spent $40 on this experience.",0
"Totally overrated.  I had heard about this place for years but had never eaten there until last weekend.Under-seasoned? Try NO seasoning.The corned beef was the most tasteless sandwich I've ever eaten.  Real skimpy on the meat as well. The cheese was barely there. The vaunted fries on the sandwich just made it more bland and soggy. Even the chili cheese fries were bland. I did like their bread and the beer was cold.Overall, a ho-hum experience. Next time, we'll go to Peppi's.",0
Worst company ever!!! Whoever the dispatcher is quite frankly is the most unprofessional person I have ever encountered. He not only informed me it would be 45 minutes but then 45 minutes came and went I called to inquire where my cab was and he said I was on the list and it could be another hour. What????? Then he was rude as hell. This is not the first time this has happened with this asshole but for me it will be the last. I don't know who owns this company but I would gladly sign a petition to make sure the owner and this joke of a company don't exist any more. My suggestion find ANY other cab company except this one.,0
"Owners and renters please be aware of this company. We have not seen any business this unprofessional and unorganized as Goldenwest. We really have no idea what they do and what we get charged for. Owners not notified of changes, renters are surprised with fees. Properties rented without proper inspection and charge fees after on tenant. Front lady that just sits there really mean faced is the rudest person I have ever encountered. Property manager Richard (what property manager?) was awful as well. He shoved a heavy glass door in our child's face, scratched his face and no apology whatsoever. Seriously not worth your money or time. Awful in every way.",0
"700 Ontario Street was the worst place I have ever lived in, and trust me, me and my roommates have lived in awful places before like basements with cockroaches, rats, spider infestations, no hot or running water, you name it. But these apartments are terrible due to Ranee Management and their incompetent employees. If you have to deal with a woman named Ekaterina at Ranee Management, then be prepared to not have your e-mails or phone calls answered, be yelled at or ignored when you try to ask your questions in her office. She wants to get paid to watch youtube videos in her office, but as soon as you go visit her and try to ask her a question or put in a request aka get her to do her job.. all hell breaks loose and she becomes a monster who just yells and belittles you. My roommates and I tried terminating our lease after our 12 months was done and they refused to terminate it until we repeatedly called and e-mailed, and we still have not gotten our deposits back despite moving out a month ago. As for the apartments themselves, very hot with no air conditioning. We've had to deal with a cockroach infestations, and 2 bed bug infestations. The fire alarms go off all the time because people smoke weed in the staircases. It's honestly not worth it, pay a little extra and go find a normal place to live in Toronto with decent landlords/management. Your mental health should not have to suffer anymore than it does, we have so much suffering we humans have to deal with on a daily basis already without having to deal with an incompetent building management company, and no cheap rent is worth having Ekaterina from Ranee Management break your soul.",0
"I ordered food for take-out a few times (while visiting in Vegas), but I was disappointed every time. The quality and presentation of the food is bad. I have learned my lesson and I will never order food at Gordon Biersch again.",0
We had a terrible experience here today. Our server was rude and very inattentive. The food was not hot and was not good. While ordering we asked the waitress if they used shell eggs or powdered eggs and she claimed they used real eggs. It was obvious that the eggs were some type of egg beater/powder as the consistency was not those of real eggs. I would not recommend or return to Terrace Cafe. Our waitress was Carley.,0
"It was shocking and sad to read all the reviews about Dr Herrero. It seems as if there are 2 different doctors being reviewed--some just love her and some say absolutely stay away! Sadly, I am with the latter choice.  I looked in Vegas for 5 years for a gyn who accepts Medicare and was a female, as my previous gyn suddenly quit her practice. I am a 70 year old woman, so I have had at least 40 to 50 annual exams. I can say that no gyn ever HURT me. Some were uncomfortable, but Dr Herrero felt like she was jabbing me with a sharp instrument, then actually cutting out tissue. I started to ask her to stop just before she finished the procedure because it was so painful. Afterward, I asked the medical assistant to talk to the Dr. She said no that Dr. was with another patient. I have always been able to talk to the Dr. afterward.Then, I got a results from the lab that said there wasn't enough tissue to test and there was too much lubricant. If the Dr. can't do a simple test preparation like a smear, how effective is she with more complicated procedures?A week later, I got a call from nurse Peggy. She said I would have to come in to take another test. I told her exactly what had happened and that the Dr. HURT me. She then really didn't want to talk to me and said I had to talk to the practice manager, Linda. Her voice box was full so I left a message with Peggy. I never got a callback.Is this how a responsible, professional organization which handles something as delicate and important as healthcare should work?",0
"2 service people came within 2 weeks,one guy texted me and said he'd be there at one,got off work early came at 5.no internet again i explained the problem to the lady on the phone about the service guy,he texted and said he'd be there between 1 and 5,guess what he shows at 9am.totally unprofessional.the internet is awful and i pay 51 a month,two different routers BS excuses.when i got their service 2 years ago i had two get them with direct tv package,then it took 4 months to hook it up because it was a engeneering problem,i've done underground utilities and the BS these people sling is really comical,really have no idea how they stay in business,best deal is have no contract!!!!!!! that made my day i'm so done,do not get service from this company unless you need extream aggravation",0
When I recived the order the food was stale and cold esp the korean bbq was dry.I won't go back. It's not great.,0
"WASTE OF TIME! The order we placed was two coffees,  2x 3 eggs, choice of bread, bacon, and home fries and 1 Monte Cristo to share. We waited over 50 minutes! I drank 5 cups of coffee. At 45 mins the waitress comes over to apologize for avoiding us and NOT making eye contact because the kitchen hadn't even started making our food! All she offered to remedy the situation was a discount on our food, didn't tell me how much of a discount, and some more coffee. When she came back with the coffee she said it would be another 15 minutes. I told her ""your telling me that they need 15 minutes to make our order? so they haven't started yet"" and she said yes. Well we left. If you need an hour and ten minutes to make a BASIC breakfast order, it's probably not going to taste good. BYE FELICIA!",0
"I wish I could give ZERO stars. Rude customer service, unbelievably crappy quality.",0
Have been shopping here with wife every year for past 11 years we have been coming. That will now end. They actually charge now for parking.

"+ Good decorBright light-tasteless foodpoor ingredientsMy wife and I went to China Impression tonight. For me, this was the worst Chinese food I had in last 5 years.  The beef dish I ordered was completely tasteless.  I think the cook forgot to put any salt. Besides no salt, barely any flavor was detectable.   We also ordered the curry chow fun, and it was the worst chow fun I had.   The tofu fish dish was terrible as well.  The mushroom tasted very dated, past expiration and the fish they put into the dish was bony and very fishy.This was by far the worst dining experience in so far as Chinese food is concerned in Mississauga.The restaurant is brightly lit and clean so it looks tempting.   But those of you who are willing to dare, remember I warned you.I will wager a bet that this place will not last 24 months.  This was by far the worst Chinese food I tasted in Mississauga.BB",0

"This place doesn't deserve to stay open. I've been here 3 times in the past 2 weeks and every time, the dogs are covered in their pee and feces. They are all so scared and  have little to no room. I have seen dogs who give up and just lay in their own droppings. The center walkway between the kennels is always full of poop and pee. Not fun when you have little ones who want to crouch down to see a puppy. I've seen mice running around in the kennels, and then going up into the walls The whole place smells awful. The ""exercise"" they give the dogs is a 2 min walk outside in a little circle in the freezing by cold, and they very rarely walk any of the dogs to begin with. Some of the dogs are literally crying, and others are practically aching just to be touched and pet, it's heart breaking. Most of the staff is awful and so rude. They change/forge paperwork, lie and change dates. All they care about is money, not the animals themselves. While all the other shelters are having holiday specials, which was a total success and all animals were adopted, they aren't. I want to rescue all those precious babies from that awful place, but that place will never see a cent of my money. Will go to AHS or a Rescue instead.",0
"I'm disappointed with this company to say the least.My fiance and I came to this establishment late January looking to purchase our first home, since they were a preferred lender of a new build community we were looking at. Once arriving we worked with a loan officer Michael Scialabba. His team was great they offered water and were friendly. Michael on the other hand was completely opposite. He talked to us in a condescending manner throughout our visit. He gave us a ridiculous rate, even after us telling him days prior with them same information another company offered 2% better. His response was ""I'm surprised"", my fiance and I are 22 and we were getting gifts for half our funds. He didn't take us seriously. He told us to come back when we can prove the money. He mentioned he works faster with money in hand. I was amazed at his rude response and shrug looks. After leaving he emailed us a few days later with a Realtors information he has worked with, and a generic thank you email. We decided to give one last try and call the realtor. She never answered nor returned a single call or email. So we gave up and went to another realtor and Quicken Loans who were amazing! Approximately a month later I get a call from Michael Scialabba, asking if we got our money and were ready to get a loan. I relayed the information that we were in contract and 3 days away from signing. I'm shocked at the response we received. He said we used him and that his expertise isn't free, that he had to fund our loan. I told him that wasn't possible and wasn't what we wanted, which then he replied with a comment of us being time wasters of honest hardworking people! He is just a rude unfriendly man seeking nothing but money. Not once did he care for our best interest, and our lives, it was always making him money. Please save your time and stay away from this man's horrible personality.",0
"As far as the public range goes, it's nice. Shooting benches are a little close together. If any anyone is using the bench next to you or even two benches away, expect to get hit with brass. All and all, it's still a nice range. The HUGE negative for this place RSO's. These guys have to be the rudist people I have ever seen. I have witnessed them absolutely sreaming at people for having a TOE over the red line. Heaven forbid that you have a live round jammed in your firearm. Don't expect them to help but DO expect them to yell and belittle you so everyone on the can hear. This place is a GOOD OLE BOYS place and if you are not a good ole boy (and 95% of you are not) expect to be harassed and belittled for everything you do. If I owned this range I take very good look at how my customers were being treated and fire those who are responsible making my customers have such an unpleasant experience. I will never go back to this range because of that. It's really a shame too because it could be a great place to shoot.",0
"I never write reviews but please be wary of this business. I purchased a package for a month of weekly removal. In the notes of my payment, I said I hadn't cleaned all winter. I let the owner know I was not available on a certain evening but I was free the next day. The owner arrived unannounced to my property on the evening when I said I wasn't available. He conducted the service without ever discussing with me any additional costs or providing me a quote. He also damaged my property attempting to access my backyard. When he presented me with an invoice for an amount of money we never agreed upon, I asked to cancel the package and have the money be applied toward the $50 one time cleaning fee listed on his website. He then changed the prices on his website and claimed I still owe him the money we never agreed upon. He then threatened legal action against me when I refused to pay for something we never discussed. I have copies of the changes to his website prices and his unprofessional emails. Buyer beware... this company is a nightmare.Update 3/16/18: This business paid a lawyer to send me a letter trying to bully me to remove my truthful negative review.",0

"We were excited to try this, but our experience was less than the ""surreal dining experience"" promoted on the menu. Our party of two waited 25 minutes to be seated at the bar alongside people who arrived after but we're seated before us. We were greeted by three of the 8 or so people working behind the bar, none of whom offered us any beverages until I had asked three times for water and coffee. (Our server actually argued with me about my request stating that being seated is not a guarantee of fast service.) The beef brisket biscuits and gravy we ordered was actually sausage gravy, and the truffle French toast with asparagus and fried egg was good but not great. The highlight was the coffee, but not even that was worth the wait and poor service.",0
"It is really rare that I write a review, however I felt strongly that one was required in this case. A large group of us went to Skin and Bones for dinner - split 11 ppl at my table and 12-14 at the other. We were provided with a fixed-price menu at $55 and the meal was served family style. At the set cost, the total per person inclusive of tax and gratuity was $72, before drinks. I have visited other restaurants with fixed price menus around this price range (Carbon Bar, Ruby Watchco, etc) but never have I experienced a collective view among most that joined me last night that the portions were beyond underwhelming - to the point that we felt cheated. Every single person, male or female, left hungry. Skipping past the appetizers to keep this review shorter, the main course was both pork tenderloin and rib eye steak. The family style plating was served at my table in two sections - so the steak and pork set in front of me was meant for 6 people. My portion of each was 1 slice. The steak was likely 10 ounces, the pork 10 ounces. That's 20 ounces of meat for 6 people. While the food was tasty, the portions were ridiculously small. Beyond comprehension - especially for $55 per person. We literally kept looking to the kitchen for the missing steaks. I had an Oreo Mcflurry on the way home (and flirted with the idea of a Big Mac) - after spending $140 as a couple + liquor on my meal.",0
"Warning!! If  you like to eat with aggressive mice at your feet this is the place!!My wife and I have been to this establishment countless times since they opened and we absolutely used to love having desert an Coffee until last nights experience. First off, we were greeted by a rude hostess who had an terrible, ""why are you making me work"" attitude, mind you, all she had to do was seat us.Once seated we were greeted by a stubborn mouse that sat at the legs of our table.  When we asked the waiter if he could do anything about it we were told ""Rodent lives matter""  and we could choose another table because they weren't gonna do anything about it my wife ordered an expresso, and her friend ordered a crepe amongst other things. The expresso came out cold and the chocolate crepes came out with unmelted chocolate chips.  The waiter dos take them back.... But they just threw them both in the microwave and we're back in less than 1 minute.If your looking for Microwaved expresso and crepes, with mice. This is your spot!!!",0
"The name they went under when I hired them was C 2 Moving Company and they were to have 3 men and a truck.

When the furniture was delivered a full side panel was missing from my Stone Creek custom entertainment center.  They lost the panel and broke an expensive Greek vase  They were supposed to contact Stone Creek to arrange a replacement for the entertainment panel.

They did not stand by restitution for my damage and that is unacceptable.  Posted for my friend who had this move 10/18/2016.",0
"I would first like to start this review off by saying I am revising my original review because of my horrifying experience from residing at Revere Tega Cay. I moved in as one of their very first tenants in August 2017-2018. I seemed to have ""minor"" issues such as no AC and rodents. I found a garden snake in my apartment, continuous fly's, ants, spiders and more. I did not complain as I knew this was newly built on land and animals/insects would be popping up. Come my second lease term starting in August 2018-ending early in January I had HORRIFIC ISSUES. I discovered mold in my apartment which gave me several health issues from living in it for an extended period of time and made me very sick. I had mold on my shoes, mirror, clothes and so much more (pictures are listed). A Mold specialist came and evaluated my apartment and identified it as mold type Aspergillus. I was informed that anything over 30% was bad. The mold specialist informed me my unit was 99% infected with Aspergillus. I quickly and promptly informed the office staff and they came and inspected my unit. I was immediately written off by their Maintenance manager Matt who told me that I should get a dehumidifier and take less showers. LESS SHOWERS?? I should be able to take as many showers as I prefer. This is unacceptable. The mold issue was then closed the following day and I promptly moved out. Not only did I have mold but I discovered mold mites in my pantry which they told me they were just I quote "" pantry pest"" end quote. If you look up pantry pest they are a different name for ""mold mites."" I had to throw out over $3,000 in furniture and approx. $1,000 clothes. (pictured will be attached of mold and they are quite gross in my opinion.)I am EXTREMELY BAFFLED  by this companies moral code of ethics and I am writing this review to warn others who think to move in. I hope no one ever has to go through what I had to. Since my leave my health has sky rocketed but I am still out thousands of dollars due to this complex. If you plan on moving here I sincerely recommend not doing that. At some point you most likely will encounter my issues. Their prices for the square footage and what is included is inciting but the buildings were made poorly with cracks in the floors, bad ventilation, VERY POOR sound proofing and garbage pick up is either late or doesn't come at all. This company claims they are a ""family company"" but don't treat you like family whatsoever. I hope this review was helpful and made you think twice about where you live.",0
"Exactly the response I expected from the owner.  Except for the part where its implied I EVER did anything where the employees/clients needed protection from me.  Anyone reading this, I find this somewhat disturbing as I was nothing but friendly and polite SO I FEEL THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND SLANDEROUS.  I WILL CONSULT MY ATTORNEY.This part of the business owner's response is ludicrous and offensive to me personally as I DID NOTHING TO WARRANT IT:: we DO reserve the right to refuse service to anyone with or without due cause, particularly when doing so protects the health and well being of other clients and employees.  Our job is to not only serve our clients, but to promote a healthy and peaceful atmosphere. My initial post:While I feel the products are very nice and natural, they are quite pricey and I felt pushed to buy products after every facial.  I let them know right off I had already recently purchased an entire skincare line and of course, wanted to use that first before buying.  Still, after each and every facial, the products they recommended were there at checkout for me to uncomfortably look at.  I see in another post, they responded to another client who felt the sales pitch was a bit much, and they say they are educating.  Listen, the facialist talked to me throughout, telling me exactly what was being applied, etc.  THAT was educational... but when the products are there are the end each and every time though I said over and over again I wasn't in need at this time (though I DID buy once anyway!!) THEN IT BECOMES A PUSHY SALES PITCH in my opinion.  Its my belief this business is only interested in clientele  who are signed up AND buying their products, that's all I can surmise after what happened to me at the hands of this business.I signed up for monthly facials after buying two 90 minute facials.  Without any reason I can fathom, right after my first monthly facial and after making two subsequent facial appointments, I I found out thru EMAIL by them cancelling my appointments, sans explanation,  that I had been dropped by them as a customer.  I gave great tips (upwards of 20% if I felt the service was great), I bought products after the first facial and am a polite person.  Of course, I called after getting the abrupt cancellations, and was met with a receptionist that was clueless when I asked what was going on... that I was confused,  She made no attempt to even say she will try and find out.  She basically said ""I don't know"" and seemed to want to end it there.  I started emailing, and whoever was responding never signed their name to the emails thought I indicated I would like to know.  I assumed it was the owner, Aminah and said so in my email back but it was never confirmed.  I guess it was more comfortable, for whoever it was, to remain anonymous.  I let the anonymous emailer I would be posting a review, I was met with intimidation... that they had forwarded my email to their attorney... as if this threat takes away my right to free speech which allows me to say how I FELT.  And that is exactly what I am doing.Bottomline, they dropped me because they can, they pretty much said it was their prerogative and I was not deserving of any explanation.  Since then, I still get their promotional emails.  I asked them to take me off their list, that was the least they could do after I felt so wrongly treated.  The response came to tell me to unsubscribe at the bottom of the promotional email.  Are you kidding me???  I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BUSINESS.",0
"Guess I will not get to try the pizza, the lady who answered the phone was a BITCH because I didn't know the address for SAIT. You live here lady and I'm sure your delivery guy who lives here knows where SAIT is too. We are visiting and from out of town, I may not know the address but even I can find the residence building. Maybe try to be more helpful next time.Customer service really seems to be a problem here in Calgary.",0

"First of all, I used to love this place.  Joseph was amazing, and if he was still there, I would keep going because he did a better job than anyone I have ever seen.  With that being said, I had the worst experience I have ever had at a nail salon today.  It actually hurts to type this because my nails are still in pain, hours later.  I went in looking to get a full set gel manicure to replace the one I had with a pedicure, and I made an appointment.  But when I got there, the tech was too busy talking on her phone.  She actually got up more than once to go make personal calls, and she left me sitting there for a while.  When she finally sat down to remove the old gel, she had me in tears because she made it so painful.  I kept telling her how much it hurt and she kept apologizing, but she didn't stop ripping it off of my nails.  Then, when she started to put on the new ones, she was in such a rush that she didn't care that half of them were crooked, and she still hadn't gotten the remaining gel off of the other half of my nails.  I stopped her and asked her to fix them all.  She did, but again, made it painful.  Finally when she got the nails on, she cut those on the left hand shorter than the right.  I asked her if she could cut the right ones down to the same size, and she just kept telling me how they were the same length, when they clearly aren't.  When she finished my manicure, she gave me a pedicure, and while the shape of my toes looks beautiful, she didn't clean the dirt out from under my nails, and she didn't put enough coats of polish on.  So, here I am...nails all different shapes and sizes, toes looking mediocre, still in pain, and down $85.  I am very sad because I really liked this place and it is so close to home, but I won't be going back.  What was supposed to be a relaxing experience turned out to be a painful and stressful one, and I can't believe I paid for it instead of walking out and getting them finished somewhere else.  I miss Joseph, and if anyone ever tracks him down, please let me know!",0
I would honestly give this restaurant place a ZERO star review if I could. We are regulars here and know Libby closely. However I have visited this location at least three times in the last year and the service is HORRIBLE. What an all time low for this restaurant. So disappointing to see this place so inattentive to customers and unwilling to make things right. Tonight I went here trying to gain the respect of this place again and once again utterly disappointed. We sat there for 15 minutes completely unattended without water on the table. We honestly just walked out and no one said a single word to us. This place once used to be my go to restaurant but now it's gone by the waste side. Not worth your time.,0
"The number is for either Boulder or Bonanza, so there's a lot of 'I don't knows' happening. First visit I had to wait 65 minutes after scheduled appointment, which they said was because it was busier than normal. So took a chance and scheduled a follow up, that's when it went south. Before going in, I called to confirm since I was never given an appointment card or follow up call. I remember either 10 or 11 am being an option. I was told I made an appointment for 8 am instead of the time I thought. Since  I work late nights, I knew that would have never happened given a choice. So to avoid being charged the $200 'no show' fee I went in as a walk in. The receptionist, I believe her name was Danielle, basically shrugged her shoulders when I asked for information, and was obviously not nice. 75 minutes of nothing before I finally asked how much longer, only to be told that it would be another hour. Thankfully i found a nice receptionist who told me that they had the wrong number on file. I don't understand how I was told that I confirmed the appointment if they didn't have my correct information. Especially since I put that on the form I had to fill out.",0
"The wait is about 2 hours, they schedule the kids by high schools.The kids keep themselves busy with their phones but if you are a parent, bring a book and get ready to read it standing up, they don't have enough seating in either area, before you pay and after you pay they send you to the back room where they get the kids ready for pictures (not much seating available in the next room either ) They do take nice pictures and touch them up to remove pimples and whatnot however get ready for a million emails offering this package and the other, if you wait long enough (right after graduation) they lower the prices by 40% and they even sell you a CD with the kids pictures for about $71. The problem is that some parents aren't able to spend the hundreds of dollars this company wants from you, it's a shame that CCSD doesn't have a more economical way for parents with low income.",0
"I just walked in here and it smells like a toilet and/or a litter box. I was trying to show my boyfriend around to a good boba place around Phoenix and well, this made a terrible impression on both of us. What happened? That and they didn't have any boba. Even if they did, I'm wondering if it would smell like a toilet too. I've gone here before and it was never like this. The stink was so bad though I don't think I'll be here again any time soon :(",0
"I should have read these reviews before ordering from these guys.  The salesperson was nice and knowledgable enough, BUT that's it.  My pedastal leg for my sink arrived in the wrong color.  No one checked it before my contractor picked it up.  The right one was in stock back east but Central wouldn't authorize a shipment for 1 item alone due to the risk of breakage....really?  6 weeks after my order, I ended up buying it from Amazon.  Shipped from back east and arrived in PERFECT condition.   I'm waiting for my credit since they could not deliver.....let's see how long that takes.  NOW I am still waiting for a bar faucet that is in stock on line by the way...the promised date keeps slipping.  The catch is NCNR but they can't commit to a delivery date.  What kind of company is this???  I will never do business here again.",0
1st time = last time.Waitress was extremely rude.Manager's response was: She's usually not like that.Okee dokee then.,0
"Leur pizza n'est vraiment pas bonne! Je me demande ce que les autres commentaires postés ici veulent dire. La pâte n'a pas de sel et ils ont ajoutés des graines de cumin à la pâte, soit disant parce qu'ils sont grecs. Du cumin dans une pizza!!! Ensuite, la croute est dure au bord et trop molle au centre, je suis obligé de la plier en deux pour la manger. Ma pizza était une pizza à emporter et elle n'a pas été découpée dans la boite. Je fais comment pour la manger dans une voiture? Il y avais beaucoup trop de champignons et pas assez de fromage, ça donne un goût bizarre. Et il manque vraiment de sel et de goût en général. Le pire c'est qu'une petite pizza coûtait 14$! Je ne reviendrais plus jamais là bas, ça c'est sur!",0

"I hate giving places 1 star, but this place deserves it.  Like others I purchased the Groupon online and thought I would give it a shot.  Upon entering was total mayhem.  The first thing I noticed was the overflowed trash can dropping french fries all over the floor.  The places screams ""Ghetto 5 Guys"".  Could this have been a potential 5 Guys franchise that never happened?.  Everything was a knock off from the menu to the red tiles on the walls.  The menu was basically a banner hung up with no proper order.  The decorations are random sports items tacked to the wall.  When i say tacked, I mean the old school thumbtacks.  It looked like a 11 year olds bedroom.    After ordering a burger I just stood there and watched the show.  The staff was sloppy and all over the place.  How hard is it to give your employees matching shirts to help clean the place up?  The cook on the grill wore warmup pants half way down with his boxers sticking out.  Come on!  He also had zero training of how to properly cook a burger.  He just kept flipping it over until it was burnt.  No flavoring at all.  Don't expect to wash your burger down with a nice Coca Cola or Pepsi product.  Their fountain is filled with all generic products.  And those hand dipped milkshakes they rave about?  Another disappointment.  They have a blender on the counter mixing in bottled flavors.  SadThe thing that made me the most upset was the overall cleanliness.  The staff was nowhere to be found.  Originally we planned to eat in the restaurant, but since every empty table was dirty we were forced to eat in the car.  It took us 18 minutes to get our burger and not once did an employee come out to wipe a table down.  A sanitary nightmare.  Other patrons were just as upset about the quality of the place as us.Don't do it, if you want it done right go to another burger place in the area.  Wasn't even worth the 6 dollar Groupon.",0
I have been around the block a number of times when it comes sushi joints.  This place must be for children because the portions are the smallest i have ever experienced and it doesnt make up for it  in quality.  $14.75 for the smallest uni nigiris ever and they werent the best grade either when the going rate in the area is 8 to 11 dollars for better quality.  I probably would have apent 6 dollars on their uni.  The amaebi is small also.  Their 16oz beer seemed like 10oz to me.  This is the tip of the iceberg.  I have no idea where these positive reviews are coming from but take it from a real person....beware.,0
Don't believe it.  Their add says same day service no problem. They DO NOT do same day service!! False advertising!!,0
After hearing about this new restaurant my husband and I were eager to try. After being seated we initially were impressed with the decor and the amount of staff. We patiently waited and one waiter zoomed by then another. Without being acknowledged or having any water service about 15 -20 minutes went by. Luckily my husband and I were chatting about how our day at work was. After flagging someone down to ask for water a waiter did the one second finger gesture to me . At that point we decide to just get up and leave. The restaurant was not excessively busy what so ever. The wait staff look like they just having their own social hour chatting amongst themselves looking a cell phone.,0
"If I could give 0 stars I would.  I picked out what I thought was my dress in Tennessee and wanted to try on the sample they specifically told me they had at this store.  I called twice and spoke with the woman and she told me they had it, even telling me size and color.  I called two days before I got on the plane to fly there and meet my bridesmaids who were also flying there and they said no problem come on in you have an appointment.  When I got there, the girl didn't even have the right style number down, then went in the back and quickly came out and said she didn't have it.  Then she reached for another gown and tried to tell me some story that they didn't have the dress but I could try on this other one.  When I got angry, she got her manager who asked how I was doing and only wanted to try and sell me another dress, not the one they said they had that I flew 2000 miles to try on.  They were very rude and unprofessional.  If you want an Alfred Angelo dress, don't go to this store.  The dresses were filthy - none of them were white, they were all dirty and dingy looking, and they were extremely unprofessional.  The other 2 stores I went to in Henderson and In Knoxville were not that way at all! If you're in Vegas, go see Sam and Irene at the other store in Henderson, they were extremely helpful and apologized on behalf of Alfred Angelo for this Rainbow store being so HORRIBLE.  Don't waste your time in this store.",0
Got here to The Sahara location at 9:28 and they are already cleaning up and the guy In the front says were only doing take outs. REALLY it's 30 mins until you close. Not 30 min until you lock the door and leave. I really hate placed that are in such a damn hurry to get out and close. I assure you the Owner of the company isn't there it's just the lazy workers who want to go home as early as possible.  I come here a couple times a month and have never experienced this.  Might not come back.,0
"Came here after midnight for the late night specials. We waited 45minutes to be sat. There were a lot of others waiting as well, place seemed to be very busy. Upon being sat we noticed empty tables everywhere and more than enough servers to cover all the sections. Ordered biscuits and gravy, cheeseburger, and the steak with eggs and hashbrowns and a slice of cheesecake. Hard to complain about for a total of $17. However, we had to wait another 35minutes for the food. Our server never acknowledged us. A different server took our food order. Another server brought us our drinks. Our server dropped off our food and walked away without saying or asking if we needed anything. The burger was ice cold, the fries undercooked. The steak which I asked for to be cooked medium-rare resembled a piece of charcoal. I still ate it because it was 2am and what else was I going to do? Actually we didn't eat the fries. Absolutely disgusting. Actually saw another table ask for the fries to be cooked longer so not an isolated incident.Our server never brought the cheesecake out and actually had the audacity to drop our check off still without saying a word to us! I counted that he had two other tables aside from ours, so in my opinion... completely inexcusable. For better service and better late night food specials visit Sundance Grill at the Silverton.",0
I go into this restaurant every weekday and I ask them to turn off that jazz music they play... Yes I said jazz. The last thing you want to hear is music that puts you back to sleep... So until they change the station I'm eating elsewhere,0
"I think it's extremely shady that you have to ask for an invoice or a breakdown of costs. I had an oil change done and had to ask for it and then I had over $2,200 in repairs done to my car (shocks, struts ect.) I thought I got a good price until I got home. I Googled the parts and found they marked up the parts 150%-200% AND they still charged labor. I understand the need for labor but the parts cost jacked up by 2.5x's is ridiculous. I could have them overnighted from Japan for cheaper. I can also understand a 20-50% mark up for picking the part up or ordering it but they still charged ""Shop fees"" I received a customer service call 2 days later asking about the service and I informed her about my disappointment about the price mark ups and all she said was ""i'll let my manager know"". I never heard back. One nice thing is they drive you somewhere when you drop your car off.",0
Wait 20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks. Just cancelled and move to Fitness Connection for $10 bucks a month. For that price I can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the Y. This place is seriously over sold. Stop selling more memberships when you don't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members. Serious over crowding issue.,0
"You know you're in trouble when you walk into a Mexican restaurant and there's ketchup on the table rather than hot sauce.  We went for some food at this lame ass joint (my gf had a gift certificate) and the place was totally empty during the lunch hour, but I admired the large screen tvs and access to nonstop ESPN in hi-def if you like that sort of thing.  But then it all went downhill.  The seats were uncomfortable.  The staff seemed confused by everything.  The food was abysmal.  If we could give less than one star, we would!Let me describe in more detail: literally every bite of food was sub-par, and we ordered four courses.  The fancy quesadilla was literally a big basic tortilla with pre-shredded American cheese.  I could have done better at home easily.  The ""burro"" had some major problems--chewy meat, crispy tortilla in the wrong way (dry), and beans that will immediately send you into salt overload.  The flautas were so greasy and unappetizing that we just said no.  I've never seen her send food back in my life.  Dessert was lame.Avoid this place at ALL cost. . Seriously Taco Bell will do you better.  Go to a real Mexican joint and boycott this monstrosity of ""Mexican"" food.",0
Ate here with my family. Got there there was a wait and the place was empty.  The hostess was trying to sit us by the entrance and there was there plenty of empty booths. I don't know how long the place has been open but it looked like they just broke in and set up a restaurant. Ceilings tiles are broken. Lightning was like I was in an interrogation room.  Food took a long time. The water tasted like it was unfiltered and straight from the tap. Food was a 4 out of 10. The waiter was very good and attentive. I felt bad not leaving him a tip. But I can't continue tipping when the food is not that great. Sorry. I am not one to complain. I eat in illegal backyard restaurants in LA and lunch trucks in the streets. Sorry for bad review. Hopefully this can help improve the restaurant,0
"The Very worst Mexican food ever!!  I have lived here 40 + years and have eaten at most Mexican restaurants in LV.  I love Mexican food, but really ""how do you mess up cheese enchiladas, chips and salsa?""  The ambience was awful, no reference to the strip club next door, but the booths were uncomfortable, no other choices for seating other than the bar or high top tables.  The service cycle was terrible, the drinks were small and expensive.  I had heard very positive things about this place and was looking forward to trying it but what a huge disappointment!!!  Much hype, no delivery.  The enchiladas tasted like the red sauce was ketchup.  Ughhh!!  Save your money go to Taco Bell!!!!",0
"Can you please figure out your phone situation....?!? I thought I may have dropped my debit card when I was there. I called the store and the lady tried to transfer me to customer service... 12 times!!!! After 17 minutes of transfers and listening to the phone ring and then go back to the original lady, someone in customer service FINALLY picked up. She said to call back after she checked a certain area. I called about 35 times only for the phone to ring for a minute and hang up. I finally called the pharmacy and all he could do was give me the store number... which I already called 35 times. Today I start my calls again and SAME thing. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that there's something wrong with your phones but my goodness this is absolutely annoying!!!!!",0
"I'm only giving 1 star in order to submit this review. This place doesn't even deserve that. I didn't even meet with the doctor, because my five minutes with the staff was such a joke that I left in shock... I've never met with any medical ""professionals"" (or lack thereof) who were SO extremely Rude and Incompetent, that they seriously compromised the integrity of this office. I honestly feel bad for the Dr's and am a bit perplexed, as I'm sure No One in their right mind trying to run a successful business would hire people to represent them with such horrific attitudes, and lack of knowledge and integrity. No respect, self righteous,  and absolutely absurd customer service. I should've heeded the warnings on these reviews. This place is quite literally, a joke. Note to the doctors- Your front staff needs proper training and recurrent reviews. No one would want to be represented this poorly.",0
"DO NOTE COME HERE!!!!! They are unapologetically biased towards african americans.

"Food is okay. Ordered the spaghettini alla francoise. Portion is big. Lobster tail is a bit tough and pasta not enough sauce.We arrived 12:15 on a Monday. Food took half an hour or so.Group of 6 and we split the bill. The server missed me while going around the table with the card machine. After I called her back, I joked and asked if I get a discount for being honest (obviously not actually expecting anything). She smiled and said ""of course darling"" then keyed the wrong amount (more than my bill) on the card reader. Didn't notice it after I paid. It's less than a dollar, but still very careless on her part. 17% service charge included on the bill.",0
"On November 9, 2017 I had mohs surgery on my right cheek. On December 28th I came in because something was clearly wrong at the site of the surgery. It was sticking out like a HUGE zit. Pus was clearly visible below the surface of the skin.  I was charged a copay, although this was really a follow up visit. Your PA looked at it for a second and told me it was nothing! Just a suture that hadn't dissolved just like she'd had on her hand.She told me to come back if it starts to drain!I was at a Dermatology office yesterday for a different matter and she was appalled at what my cheek looked like. She found LOTS of pus. There is now a cyst at the site of the mohs surgery that was filled with pus!It should have been treated when I came into your office a month ago.I received sub-standard care. I was treated very unprofessionally by an uncaring PA.I will need a kenalog shot!!I expect an MD at your office to look at my cheek and administer the steroid shot, without charging me an additional fee.The poor patient care I have received so far deserves a very poor review on Yelp, health grades, and every other relevant social media sites!",0
"I'll agreed with the previous post is a waste of time and if you used them a waste of your money .They are crooks they don't know nothing about morgages but they know how to suck your hard earned dollars , I made the mistake to used them for a second morgage what a nightmare it was it took them almost 45 days to do a second morgage then to my surprise there  were fees for almost everything that you could imagine I was surprise that it was not a fee for when their wiped their assessment. So if you like to be rip off go ahead and used them otherwise run and don't look back",0
"Let me start by saying, it takes a lot for me to get angry. This salon has TERRIBLE customer service. I got the cluster eyelash extensions put on one Friday. To start off, the woman showed me them when they were done, and they were not at all what I asked for. I specifically asked her to make them look natural, and they did not.. at all!! I paid, hoping that the more I looked at them, the more I would like them. Before I even made it to my house, a chunk of clusters fell on to my lap while driving. I called the salon when I got home, and was told to send a picture to the owner.  She told me that she could redo them, but they would be an additional $40 on top of what I already paid!! She said she would look at the picture then text me telling me what my options were, and I NEVER received a text. The eyelashes were almost completely off not even 48 hours after I got them done. They applied way too much glue, and now they are pulling my real eyelashes out as well. Unprofessional and inexperienced. I will never be going back!!!",0
"Terrible service!! I came here Sunday night(jan 31/16) a little after 6pm. There were only 2-3 other customers in the restaurant. My family and I sat down and were presented with menus. The waitress didn't take our drink order. We waited 20 minutes for her to come to our table before I went up to the bar to find her. She was busy texting on her cell phone. I told her my family and I were ready to order. She said ""OK"". I asked if she could please come to our table to take the orders, said said"" OK "" again. We waited an additional 10 minutes and she still didn't show up. We decided to leave. As we walked out the door we saw her behind the bar on her cell again. This is unacceptable considering there were only a few other customers in the place. Avoid this place, they don't deserve your patronage. We ended up going to Wild Wings on St Clair near Runnymede instead.",0

One star for customer service and rude behaviour.......nobody in the store is polite. We are here for food not for the attitude. Please improve the customer service. They don't even deserve one star .,0
"the place used to be excellent. i used to come here at least once a week. now the food quality is horrendous. i ordered chicken teriyaki, it smelled like sewage and tasted spoiled. their sushi comes with fish that's been sitting out for two days. after the last time i ate here i got a stomach ache. i understand trying to save a few bucks, but not at the expense of health!",0
The worst cocktail service when playing at the tables. Dealers just want to cash out off your money and pit bosses let it slide. Very poor customer service and will not come back due to lack of attention,0
"My girlfriend and I came here for lunch before we had to go to work one day.  The service was absolutely horrible.  I was never offered a drink but was brought two glasses of tap water with no straws.  When the server, who acted like a monotone robot, did finally come around she asked my girl for her order then just stared at me!   Oook, whatever.  The Mexican omelette and club sandwich took over 25 minutes to get to the table.  Really?!!!   I get they were a little busy but come back and tell us it will be out soon.  The food finally came and it had no flavor whatsoever.  How do you F up a turkey sandwich!  We had to get to go boxes since it took forever and we had to leave.  She brought our check with the boxes and the check had food all over it.   By this time we were both irritated and wanted to leave but that took forever from the two cashiers that don't know how to work the register.   It's a damn credit card, swipe the crap and let's go!   Needless to say, we will never ever come back to this place, it was kind of busy but at least have upbeat staff who act like they appreciate your business and cooks that can put turkey and bacon on bread, not burn the shit out of it!   I'm never ever one to complain but this was ridiculous!",0
I was charged $12 each for two dishes listed on the menu for $9 each.  I pointed this out to the waitress as we left.  She said she was sorry but did not offer to correct and refund the difference.  We certainly will not return and suggest anyone dining at Cinco review their bill closely.  Ripping folks off seems to be part of the business plan.,0
"""We care more about working with FedEx than we do with you.""  This was what this location said to me the day I came in to pick up the moving truck that I had reserved months ago only to find out they decided to lease out all their trucks to FedEx through the end of the holiday.",0
Was charged for services when they never showed up to do them. Was told I had to pay anyway. Avoid at all costs unless you want to throw away your hard earned money for nothing.,0
"Yikes! Never gonna go again! Three out of five dishes I wanted to order were not available, so I asked the owner to suggest something. I ended ordering barbecue sausages. They were 6.99 so I thought they should be good. But all I got were two Frankforts (1.99 for 10 in supermarkets) with lots and lots of salt and pepper and were terribly burnt. I don't wanna go there again.",0
"TERRIBLE!! TERRIBLE!! TERRIBLE!! I had my wedding here 9/16/13 and I have very few good things to say about this place. My husband and I really made a mistake by choosing this place. Contract: Before we signed the contract I told Mara (coordinator) about what I wanted she says, ""no problem, we can do whatever you want"". Then after we signed the contract complete 360. We fought every step of the way. We were told it's an extra $300 charge if you choose to have the pillars over the dance floor. Then when we decided we didn't want the pillars the (Florist/ decorator) Grace completely went off on us. ""Are you kidding me! I'm not taking them down! They don't ever come down!""  I mentioned to her that we were told it was optional and she said she doesn't care and wasn't taking them down and if Mara said you can take them down she can do it herself, because I'm not doing it. I was told there would be a staff handing the decorations,  there was no one there helping us. Monica (coordinator) let us in to start decorations,  but did not lift a finger to help us. My Aunt asked her to come down stairs to help, so she comes down and proceeds to argue with my aunt about whats in the contract. My family, husband and I decorated the venue.  I brought waters for my guest, I was told I would be supplied with a bucket to put them in. It was a white trash can with a trash bag in it. I was told when the bridal party arrives they would be greeted with a glass of wine. And the groom's party would be greeted with a beer and would have a grooms lounge. There was no drinks for either party and the grooms lounge was a mess. It looked more like a storage room, there were chairs stacked up all over the room that my family had to move them all out just to get into the room. There was one couch and a very warped ping pong table. We had to find someone to get the beer and wine we were promised, then we told we couldn't have it even though its in our contract. Cake: My husband and I scheduled an appointment 4 times with Jose (baker) and it all had to be on his time whenever he told me he was available. That was fine, bu every single time I scheduled with him for the times he asked, he had a different excuse everytime as to why he wasn't there. We called him each time we arrived at the bakery and asked where he was and if he was still coming. We never met with him we scheduled times to meet he never showed up to any of them. Finally I told him I would give our order to Mara and he could get it from her.Bottom line I feel that after we signed the contract the good service went down the drain. I think this place should care more about their customers. Brides shouldn't have to decoration on the morning of their wedding and stress about the details not being right. You pay them to worry about that for you. Our cake, service, DJ, Food, decorations everything at this place was an isssue. EXPECT the photography. He was amazing. He was late,  but amazing.  !",0
"I would absolutely give Thrifty car rental a zero if it was available.  The whole experience has been a NIGHTMARE!!! I rented a car 2 days ago and I cannot get anyone on the phone to help me with the problems I am having.  They have charged me twice, got a flat tire on the 1st rental car and the GPS system they rented me does not work.  Ugh!!!  Don't rent from these people.  It is not worth the 7 extra hours of agrivation I have had the last 2 days.  I'm supposed to be enjoying my vacation.",0
"Not my favorite car wash. But every time I visit it brings a new adventure to my life. It is the closest car wash to my house that isn't a drive thru & I end up going back because they have decent groupons. I would NEVER go without a groupon, at the point you may as well wash it yourself (truly)!! Visiting this car wash here are things you may encounter. You can thank me later *plan an hour of your day upon arrival. Doesn't matter how many vehicles are there. *dont expect quality. If you have a 3rd row of seats it may not even be noticed. Meaning it will not be wiped or vacuumed. *you may drive away with your hood not latched down. Why on earth would it be opened? Because upon arrival they like to tell you how horrible your car looks & upsell the crap out of you! *they will try to convince you to steam clean your carpets before even looking to see your entire flooring is rubber mats (true story)!*they may rip said rubber mats out of your car & break the tabs then put them back in like nothing happened. And later deny breaking them. And last but not least my latest adventure: I pre bought a detail at Christmas time- it was a decent deal & my 3 year old car had never had a good cleaning or wax. I make my appointment & show up to be told the package I purchased less than 3 months ago (mind you I pre-paid $100-- it also came with several washes that I was able to gift) to be told my deal expired. I was speechless as this man told me I had ONE month to use it. I argued, I had not been told that. I started to get upset & finally asked to speak with a manager after 4 minutes of getting no where with this man. When he started laughing that he was just teasing me, at this point I was a little worked up. I have a great sense of humor, but that went too far to be funny! Then he tried to charm and upsell me & at that point I just wanted to kick him in the shin!!! He turned pretty cranky on me once I wouldn't buy anything from him. That being said my relationship with this car wash is done groupons or not! I'll wash it myself if I have to.",0
"If possible would give it no stars - worst service ever, took over twenty minutes for our server to come back with our drinks and then never came back to ask if wanted anything else",0
"If you want to ride in a portable SAUNA from one destination to the next... take Elite!!! This was THE hottest vehicle I have ever been trapped in! My brother and sister-in-law booked Elite to take their bridal party from a local church to the Smith Center and by the time we arrived... We were all drenched in sweat! The air was blowing but not cool AT ALL. I know it takes some effort to cool off a bus of that size with a ton of people, but I grew-up in Vegas and have ridden on many party buses, and NEVER has this been an issue!!! All of the bridesmaids and groomsmen were soaked when they stopped at the first destination for pictures. This company couldn't even offer my brother and his wife a thing to remedy the situation. We spoke to the photographer, and she even said she'll have to spend hours editing out all of the sweat stains on the tuxedos and dresses! This left all of the girls' makeup melting off, frizzy and fallen out hair that was wet, and completely ruined attire due to sweat stains. Very disappointing! Limo companies are a dime a dozen in Vegas, and Elite should take more pride in their services because it is very easy to take you business elsewhere. You had one job. *shaking my head*",0
This place is awful it should take about 1 minute to make an acai bowl and I've been waiting 25 minutes for mine I'm mushing don't come here unless you're prepared to wait a long ass time for your order,0
All my food was cold. Got a number 7 with tots and a coney. Ate it in the car and it all tasted like yesterday's left overs. Just plain Horrible.,0
I bought a Groupon and it said you can use it during the month of October because they were going to be closed.  November 1st I called to set an appointment and had to leave a voicemail and did not receive a response.  After a couple of days I called again left a voicemail no response. This went on for two weeks and I finally started calling the other offices. Never got a response from anyone and got very frustrated so I had to call Groupon to request a refund.They then called me to schedule an appointment even though the doctor is in California and so if they set me up for a 1 o'clock appointment. The day before they call to confirm. I called back and verbally confirmed 1 o'clock Mountain Standard Time and they agreed.Now sitting in front of the office waiting for them to show up and it's about quarter after 1 I called the corporate office to see what was going on they said they should be there. No one's here I'm leaving now and just wanted to let everyone on Yelp know that this is the worst customer service completely disorganized and not worth the time or frustration.I dictated this message into my phone so please excuse any weird verbage that may be posted.,0
"We have been in this house not even 24 hours there was no water, the house was filthy, and the best part- we were promised a new fridge and there was none. We were then delivered a fridge FULL OF COCKROACH EGGS. Janneal Bell is AWFUL, she kept soliciting us for yelp reviews because ""her boss was being hard on her"" as soon as the review was posted she dropped us and I have not been able to get a hold of her or anyone to fix this problem, so this is my updated review! DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE",0
"Ordered chips and salsa, took 3 years to get it. They can't handle basic service items.",0

"I came to Cabin of Willowick while in search of sushi near my home. I am pleased to report that the Dragon Roll I had was wonderful, however, my experience there as an African American customer was less than stellar. I called in and had a pleasant conversation with the friendly young lady who answered and took my order. When I arrived I went in and waited by the hostess station until a member of the staff could assist me. A waiter came up to me and asked if I was an Uber driver. I thought that was an odd thing to start off asking someone waiting at your hostess station. I politely informed him I was a customer who called in a phone order and he went on his way, but did not assist me. Moments later, a second man appeared at the hostess stand and asked me if I was an Uber driver. At this point I let him know he was the second staff member at this point to ask me if I was an Uber driver and not a customer awaiting service. He apologized, I told him my order, he said he knew of it and went to get the hostess. She rang me up and I received my food but felt a certain type of way from the assumptions that I couldn't possibly be a patron. I called the restaurant as I was driving home and asked to speak with the owner. I told him of my experience and that I could not help but to think that the treatment had something to do with me being African American. He was very polite and apologized for my experience and assured me that wasn't the case. I said that asking someone who is waiting for service if they are Uber is not the way to greet a guest in an establishment, to which he agreed. He asked me if there was anything that he could do and I kindly refused and let him know that I wasn't interested in receiving anything. I simply wanted to bring the situation to his attention in the hopes of preventing another customer from experiencing similar treatment. I did let him know I would not be returning.",0
"If you love animals, this place will break your heart.. EVERY SINGLE CAGE HAD FECES IN IT, not a single pup looked happy and they quoted $3,000 for a poodle-bichon mix, really?  When I say every cage, I mean LITERALLY ALL OF THEM. It was clear that they pooped multiple times, diarrhea style (probably from stress). The parrots were distressed and the store is DISGUSTING, which is insane because there were literally 4 employees on the floor..... what? What kind of owner, who cares even slightly for animals, would allow this? Like I said, if you love animals and are looking for one, avoid this place. UNLESS, you are looking to save all of the animals and blow $30,000+. The animals belong in a sanctuary to heal, this place should really be shut down and shame on whoever manages/owns it.  PETA, where you at?!?",0
"They charged me an unwarranted $100 ""deep cleaning"" fee! First of all my husband is a pipeline guy and I'm a retired traveling performer so I've stayed at over 100 motels hotels and airbnbs over the years and N EVER have been charged this before. My kids did leave some play dough behind but manager made it sound way worse then it was. He claims he will have to hire a professional carpet cleaner which I know from my own experience with cleaning up play dough is a lie.  I even tipped the maid for the extra mess. Other then that it is not in North Madison but in the middle of nowhere! I go to Madison quite a bit there are way better places to stay that are located in and around the city and some are cheaper. Breakfast wasn't the greatest and the lady that did the breakfast kind of hovered over us borderline stalkerish.  Go to Hampton Madison West or even Super 8 Madison East both way better choices",0
"Eating at this restaurant was such a disapointment. I'm not sure if other reviewers have ever eaten good seafood or not to give it such high ratings. We had a reservation and even though the restaurant was empty it took them 15 minutes to come take our drink order. Oh, and don't expect to get an alcoholic beverage here. They dont serve booze but they told us we could ""go buy wine from CVS and then we can open it here and charge you a wine corking fee"", well no thank you. They also don't accept credit cards.The lobster bisque was runny and not flavorful, I'm not even sure any lobster was in it. The rest of our meals were just sub-par and with flies buzzing all around our table the dining expierence was less than appetizing. After the terrible service we received and bad food, I dont have an urge to even give them a second chance.",0
"Poor quality and poor service. The food is very cheap the prices and quality the hash browns I thought were supposed to be shredded. They're actually a mash like consistency not very good taste like they came from a box they had a burnt layer not good at all. My omelet was ok it was a steak omelet the steak was bland really no flavor on anything I ate. The server forgot our meals came with toast we told her that the menu said our food came with toast. She replied ""do you want toast?"" We said yes our food was supposed to come with it she asked again if we wanted it a little ruder than the first time. I ordered a side of bacon which also didn't arrive with our meals and boy did I regret it ordering it. The bacon had to be the cheapest bacon you can find I can't believe the bacon was that bad. The place is small so I understand it can be load but the staff are very very loud the music was loud also. It was hard to talk to the person I was with the staff was extremely loud and obnoxious the cook kept ring a bell to let them know the food was ready. He rang it just the get their attention or when it was his turn to talk and be loud it was ridiculous they were laughing and joking around. I don't mind them making their work day fun and enjoying their self, but when your costumers can't even have a conversation because of how loud the employees are. It's not going to make me return the sad part is I ate there before and the place was a good place to eat and the quality was a 100 times better. Spend a couple extra dollars and go somewhere else unless you're that cheap and willing to endure how bad this place is.",0
"The management at this location is AWFUL. I had a membership and had to cancel due to health issues. I presented the front staff with documentation and was ensured that I could transfer or used THREE paid visits. It was noted on my account and when it was time to use them we were denied service. I spoke to the office manager after several phone attempts to be told that the staff member did make notication but was no longer employed there and I would not be reimbursed OR be able to use the THREE paid services. ""Too bad Too sad""WOW I AM OUT OF $180 and THE OFFICE MANAGER DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION. NO COMPROMISE NO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION!!!!!

"First off... Let me preface this with the fact that I am well aware that I have thick hair and on this particular visit it was super long. So my boyfriend frequents this Great clips because it's closest to our home. He only goes there when this particular hair dresser is on duty because she's ""great"". I decide I need a hair cut and stop by Great Clips hoping that ""great"" hairdresser is available. I walk in, she's in and there aren't many people waiting. GOOD. I check in and wait. I should say that while waiting 2 people complain about another hairdresser on duty. The culture is very quick clip and go. Still. I wait.  Finally my turn. She greets me and I sit but I warn her about my length and I make her fully aware that I wanted to chop a good amount off. No biggie, right? She begins by almost discouraging me about the amount I wanted to cut. Asking me ""Are you sure?"" at least 4 times. Whatever. I'm already on the chair. She starts to brush through my hair and my head was snapping back so hard and I was clearly in discomfort but she keeps brushing through until I ask her if I can brush through my own hair. Not once did she apologize or seem to acknowledge the discomfort. As she begins to measure out the length and confirm with me I ask her if it was possible to make a first cut long enough and then we can go from there if I wanted to go shorter. She claimed that she couldn't do that because then she'd have to charge me two haircuts. OK?!... We go back and forth and I settle with ""bra strap"" length. I figured that's long enough to get used to shorter hair than what I've had for 5 years now. She starts chopping off and I remind her that I didn't want a blunt straight cut and she says ""then how do you want it?"" At this point I'm ready to get out of the chair except she's already chopped off half of the hair. I asked her to do what they call a ""notch cut"" which makes the hair look more choppy than straight cut. As she's cutting my hair, they get a new customer and another hair dresser checks them in and I can hear the customer being told that the wait would be 15 minutes. My hairdresser butts in and says ""more like 30, I've got a lot of hair here"" not in a joking way, not in a light hearted way but in a tone of annoyance. Anyway. She basically finishes my haircut and shows me the mirror and my hair is shoulder length!!!! SHOULDER LENGTH!!!!! Not mid back... Not ""bra strap"" length, as she called it"" but SHOULDER LENGTH!!!!! What am I supposed to say ""it's too short!! Glue it all back on"" I paid, tipped and left. The only reason why I tipped was because it was a lot of hair to cut. So here is my recommendation. 1. DO come here if you're a guy. They've got the quick, clip and go thing down. 2. DO check in online. Everyone that walked in and had not checked in online ended up waiting upwards of 30 minutes. 3. DO NOT come here if you are looking for customer service and a friendly experience. 4. DO NOT come here if you want anything other than a trim and buzz cut ( duh. I know. But I've been to the great clips on rainbow and they've styled my hair better than a $90 hairdresser would. all in all. I learned my lesson. Never again.",0
This happened to me a year or two ago there. I am a vegetarian and ordered the veggy fajitas. Then the waiter asked that for 2-3 dollars more I can get extra mushrooms. Ive been to the lone star in kingston and it came with so many mushrooms that I thought why would I need extra... It was the location at kingston that got me hooked. When my food came I was shocked that there was only onions and broccoli... Ive been to several lone stars around ontario and I know each ones food is different but the one on front street left me wondering if it was a joke. Conclusion; will never go back there because in my opinion its the worst of the franchise and there are other locations nearby which are much better.Lone Star pickering and ajax are much better; kind of funny that people in the core are getting less.,0
"CVS you need to train your people better.  Been bounced back and forth trying to get my 3 year olds Epipen.  No communication, no sense of urgency at the Bell locations in N. Scottsdale.

We were in Vegas a few days ago and wanted to try out Gordon Ramsay Steak so we called reservations and found out they were booked until after 10pm.  No problem as she told us we could go to the bar if we wanted to as it has a full menu there.  We ended up going to dinner at American Fish and decided to have a drink and dessert at Ramsay.  When we got to the host stand we were told that the bar was bought out for the night by a party.  This would have been great information to give us when we called earlier that day don't you think?! We were pissed but not as pissed as if we had decided to come here for Dinner.  We got over it and went to Max Brenner for dessert which was great.  I don't know if this was the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing but it left a really bad taste in our mouths.  Maybe we'll try it the next time we go...but there are so many other stellar choices in Vegas.,0
"The WORSE service department I have ever had to deal with.  I bring my F150 2013 truck in because the roof started sagging.  We were told we had done something to it.  WE HAD DONE NOTHING!  They said that they would have to take out the liner to know for sure what happen.  So the next day they call and tell us we had bent the support bar in the middle of the roof of the truck.  We explain AGAIN that NOTHING has happen to that truck.  So my husband pays them a surprise visit so he can see what they are talking about.  THEY HAD NOT EVEN TOUCHED THE TRUCK, THEY WERE LYING TO US!!!!!  So the manager tells us she will send it to someone else to have them look at it.  Being we no longer trust these people.  Well she decided after we left that she didn't have to do what she told us that she would just have her dishonest people look at it.  The next day we are called and told they are shocked by what they found, NO SUPPORT BAR AT ALL was in the middle of the roof!!!!!!  They could not believe it!!!  They call FORD and are told NOPE they don't put a support bar in the middle of the ROOF!!!!!!!!!!! What the heck????????  So Earnhardt says we will spray foam in it for you for 2000!!!!!!!!  No thank you! Foam won't save my kids in a roll over accident!!!! So we go get our truck only to now have a dent in the roof as well as the sagging!!!!!!  DISHONEST HORRIBLE SERVICE DISRESPECTFUL.  Never ever should anyone go there and sorry but if you are in a new F150 Ford truck you should check out there lack of support brackets in the middle of the roof!!!!  UNSAFE!!!!!!",0
"Horrible.  Chicken for salad had cartilage in it.  Also other..burrito, etc.  ended up throwing in trash and getting KFC.  Spent $27.  Called and complained, district manager said he would send me $50 in gift cards.  He did....5-$10 only good for one at a time, AND EXPIRED!  I complained again, he assured me if I went back they would honor everything....I did not believe him and told him I wanted my money back.  He ended saying that he would have to figure out how to do that.  I haven't heard from him since (almost 2 weeks) And probably won't.  I will NEVER go back to Pollo Loco.

"I have been craving Persian food for some time now, I even had a dream I was enjoying Persian food with all of my family members at home like the good all days. I have been to Zaytoons and enjoyed it. Village was freaking terrible the kabob was defiantly frozen.   The tadig with the khoresh was ok but nothing special. My friend and i walked in we were greeted by nice persian music but since we don't looked persian the owner changed it to italian music WTF... who wants to listen to that while sitting in a Persian place trying to enjoy what they claim as authentic food. I am lost for words how weak the food was here. I will never return to this establishment. If you eating in a massive restaurant by yourself, honestly my party was outnumbered by the staff. I was the only patron in here it was a very erie feeling, there is NO way the food is fresh.",0
"Really awful. Lobster ravioli certainly frozen product, with what tasted and presented like jarred pasta sauce. The presentation also awful. It was like eating a TV dinner. Ambiance also off.

"We tried this noodle place twice. Dining area not too big , only about 10 dining tables. My husband and I both tried Shangxi sliced noodle on the menu, noodle is ok, not very outstanding. The soup taste kind of sweet , I wonder if they putting too much sugar in there. The second time when we visit I tried the beef noodle soup , I feel like it mostly taste the same as Shangxi sliced noodle in flavor I don't think this place Authentic! All of noodle soups I ever tried there almost taste like same way! mention about live noodle making , I believe it is only for show, they use noodle which been prepared not the noodle from the bar!",0
"We have always loved the steaks at Outback.   So my husband planned a birthday dinner for me  with five of our friends.  What a disaster.   First we were shown to our table which wasn't set up, missing  chairs.  Waiter came took orders, served us bread, 2 loaves and three plates for seven people.  Then when the steaks were brought out, not everyone received their dinner.  And if they were lucky enough to get dinner, the meals all had missing items, vegetables etc.  My husbands prime rib looked like a hockey puck, ordered med well.  Our last friend finally received his order after the manager stopped by the table.  This was after all others  were mostly finished.  Manager did take 15 percent of our bill.  But will not go back to this Outback.  Horrible food and service.",0
"UPDATE: well since you responded so diligently i figured you deserved a reply. If you claim the cookie dough is oh so popular and it speaks for itself when you're sold out of it early in the day it really speaks volumes of you as a business owner. If you think majority of everyone is coming to your establishment for your world famous edible cookie dough then I'd make it my #1 priority to make sure I never ran out of it. I'll wait patiently for your response as to why you can't make enough of it to satisfy your customers breaking down your front door to eat it. Also if you take a quick glance through the majority of your poor reviews you will quickly and I mean QUICKLY see I am not in the minority with how bad it tastes. But you fail to reply to them in your condescending business owner tone. As to why I didn't try the sample first I assumed (MY FAULT YES I KNOW) it was going to be on the same level as a a Toll House piece of raw cookie dough. Yes I know no raw eggs but Jesus Christ it's a .05/10 on a scale from 0-10. I also didn't try a sample because I like to support local small businesses. My total was $3ish and I left a $5 without hesitation. Lastly I was planning to bring the one scoop back to my girlfriend to split it with her but refused to even allow her to try it. To bring in my other negative reviews shows me that this got to you on a personal level and for that I apologize. I write the truth sometimes in a harsh tone. You should be able to take criticism as a business owner and learn from the negative reviews you received. If you read my negative reviews again they are all justified. That's what yelp is about. Letting the public know the truth. Sorry it isn't all peaches and daisies 5 star reviews. 1- run out of cookie dough ""early in the day"" 2-don't have boba ready when you open, well that's why people go into restaurants early to ""PREP"" as in P R E P A R E ahead of time. Perhaps you are just so busy that you can't go into your own business an hour early to start making boba. Whatever the case is the above 2 simple items would have lowered the amount of negative reviews you received thus far since being open. Quite easy solutions as well. I would have still left a negative due to the poor taste but maybe 3 stars if the first time you weren't out of it after couple hours of being open. Anyways, good luck and if your recipe every changes for the edible cookie dough I'd love to go in and try it. ----------2 stars for the service the employee helping me was nice. First time I went in for the edible cookie dough chocolate chip and they said they were out, it was 3pm in the afternoon on a random weekday :-/ so he offered their cake batter cookie dough which sounded really delicious......it was abysmal. Like it should be called Unedible Cookie dough because omg it was awful......anyways I came back at another time and they had it. I got it. Took 2 bites and threw it in the trash can outside. Unbelievable. All I heard about the edible cookie dough from my friends on the east coast is how fricken good it is. But this was just SO SO SO gross.......super disappointed. I was looking forward to it big time. Oh well live and",0
"Gluten-free review:There aren't many gluten-free options here and cross contamination is high. Everything is fried in the same vat so their fries are contaminated with gluten from the battered items they offer. I believe the seafood is also cooked all together so if you have allergies to some seafood and not others then you shouldn't risk eating here. The wait staff also don't seem to be educated well on allergies. When asked if the fries were gluten-free the waiter said no because it wasn't breaded. When I asked if it was fried in the same vat as their breaded items he said yes but the heat should kill everything. I informed him that's not how gluten works and cooking it in the same vat would create cross contamination. He seemed very surprised by this. Not a good first impression. I had a a few bags with each of the sauces and different seafood. Everything was tasty but I ended up bloated with a stomach ache later that night, so I'm guessing this was either due to cross contamination or gluten in the sauces. The only gluten-free alcoholic drinks listed was sake or soju for $17. Everything else was only beer, which was around $5. Other than the massive price difference for the gluten-free drinks, they didn't have any cider or wine, which is pretty standard at most restaurants. Aside from the gluten issue, I think paying $30 per person (before tip) for a meal here is not worth it. Food was tasty, but not worth the price tag or the health issues. TL;DR gluten everywhere and staff uneducated about cross contamination",0
"I am so disappointed with my recent lunch experience here. After passing by it on several trips to Vegas, I was dying to give this place a try, but I never seemed to have enough time to fit in in to my stay. This past weekend, however, I made it a point to finally try it out and I was so extremely disappointed. I wanted to love it, I thought I was going to love it, but it was actually one of the worst dining experiences I've had in an incredibly long time.We were seated right away at an outside table, which was nice. Our waiter immediately came over to take our drink order, which was also great, except we weren't ready to order. They have a pretty good beer selection so we needed another minute to think it over. That's when it all went down hill. Although he had seemed eager to get our order in when we first sat down, he then seemed to forget about us completely. We had long waits between waiter sightings, and often had to ask other waiters to find ours. He would halfheartedly apologize for a wait, but then disappear all over again, not to be seen until we found someone to track him down. It was crazy! There was a party of 6 sitting across from us, then a party of 4, then another party of 4... so 3 larger parties all came, ate, and left by the time we had gotten our food! We were just a party of 2...The food was on the pricier side for what it was, so I was expecting high quality. I ordered the sliders, and was disappointed when I tried them. They weren't bad, they just weren't good. They weren't juicy or flavorful as I had been expecting. I had just recently had some amazing beef sliders in AZ (for half the price) and these didn't even come close. I would say the food was average, and not worth the price tag. The service was beyond terrible. We did more work than our waiter did, having to flag people down and ask them to find him repeatedly. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience and I won't be going back.",0
"well I just called this place for the first time,  I thoroughly searched the services offered on their website beforehand...when I called the business a woman answered the phone, and either the connection was bad or she hung up...when I called back the same person answeed the phone, not too friendly I might add...I asked do they do alterations on formal wear? she replied no, I explained that on their website it states that they do...she rudely replied they don't and hung up the phone...very unprofessional, they never need to worry about me calling again...YIKES!!!",0
"My family and i went here last Christmas when it first opened up. Had a great  experience with the course  menu.  Awesome food prepared by a chef from korea with plenty of food and the course  was $35 per person. Came back here for mothers day ordered the same course and it was a horrific experience. The ownership must have changed along with the chef. Made reservations, so we sat down right away.. waited 10 minutes to order and it wasn't even that  busy, they had four servers,  which seemed plenty given the size of the restaurant which isn't huge. It took another 15 minutes for the food to start and after a few plates there was a 20 minutes pause in our course and we asked several times what the hold up is and they just kept saying sorry we're busy. They were not under-staffed or overly busy. The manager just dies not know how to run the restaurant.By the end we just  wanted to leave, the food went down in quality since opening up, the service was a nightmare and the food is over priced. I am very easy going with food and servers but this place is over hyped by the other reviews. Do not, i repeat, do not dine here.",0
"Use to love this dispensary,but now they r jacking up their prices. Never any flower specials anymore. Just greed for the profit. Dont bother guys. Use to have flower fridays,now they have ""ZERO"" fridays. Learn how to run a business guys. $30 1/8s were great!! But no more",0
"We were there on the Opening Day, Monday by 6pm. Hubby and son have been waiting for the opening. We expected long wait and seating challenge of course, that's given, so we ordered for to go and just found a space to wait for our food. The staff seemed overwhelmed. 30mins and we were still waiting. They have paper trail with orders and they can't seem to find it. Eventually, they had to put in the order and asked us to wait again. Many months after, once in a while we go thru the drive thru and ALWAYS have to be asked to move forward and wait for the order...most often I would call this SLOWFOOD.",0
Unbelievable! Enter that drive thru line at your own risk.  You might be there up to 19 minutes and not get any food. Is this a training store?,0
Very disappointed with the level of service provided. I had a dental emergency and found myself having to defend the urgency of the situation in order to try and get an appointment as soon as possible. I have found another local dentist who was very responsive and understanding.,0
"Only giving one star because zero stars isn't allowed. No stars. I ordered a falafel sandwich and a chicken shwarma sandwich. I asked for no pita with the shwarma, they charged me for a platter ($6 more... And still used pita) SEVENTEEN dollars for some crappy rice chicken and a mediocre falafel sandwich and on top of that there was a hair. Thanks but no thanks. Total fail.",0
"I think the company forget about this part of their mini-chain right after it was built. When I walk into the Tempe location, the place is buzzing and more importantly, there are about 15 fresh and hot pizzas in the window. The last two times I attempted to grab a slice at this location, I turned around and walked right out after the disappointing and pathetic pizza display case. Most recently, it was earlier this week and nobody is greeting me or waiting at the register for an order despite only 5 folks hanging out here at lunchtime. The display case (which has room for alot of pies) had two incredibly old and dead looking pies, both were cheese and both only had half their slices remaining. This is at lunchtime. I really like the pizza at this chain, but somebody fell asleep right after this outpost opened. Wake up!",0
"Do not use this company. Once in transit I noticed our driver did not match the picture of the license posted in the cab. We were late to the airport and had to use the card machine. A couple of days later sure enough, over $500 of fraudulent charges made on that card all over Vegas.",0
"this firm will quit on u on the day of the ssi disability hearing!!! so foul and very unprofessional!! they dont communicate much with their clients! just overall unsatisfied with this firm. my personal recommendation, just dont waste time with these clowns. get urself a much better and loyal firm!!",0
"Went few days ago and the blonde bartender, I think Andrea was so rude! She had a bad attitude, she was bullying everyone and soo disrespectful! I will not be back, nobody will talk down on me like this",0
I love the pizza from Papa Murphy's but I would not go to this location at all. The poor worker was doing her best to get the pizzas made while people continued to come in. She was forced to work alone while a manager sat in the office  as she did have to run back there to get approval on something so there was someone back there. That person did not come put to help at all. This location is very badly ran and I would highly recommend using the locations on Decatur or Durango and completely pass by this one. No stars at all for this place tried to give no stars but app would not let me,0
"Allan, as a former hospitality specialist I really appreciate you reaching out.  Message me directly and I'd be happy to discuss.  Thank you for your time",0
If I could give zero stars I would.we placed an order for pick up and when my wife arrived they gave her the wrong order I called back to tell them they gave me the wrong order they told me that they're sorry and to  come pick up my real order I told them I live 15 miles round-trip they did not care the girl on the phone named autumn was very rude. She told me that she relayed the order to my wife and that my wife agreed it was the order they straight out lied. When I finally got the pizza it was cold and the salad was Hot stay away from this pizza parlor,0
"never again... rude, smelly, weirdo that was trying to ask me out!!! Yuk!!! To make matters worse he went the longest way possible & ripped me off...",0
Don't listen to them.   They will tell you of a room with two beds and when you check in I'll give you a king room and offer a rollaway.,0
"**Edited to reply to the Manager***After receiving a response to my comment on Yelp, I took the time to reply to the manager through email on March 26th. My email detailed exactly why I'd written my review in the way I had and gave a further description of the waitress who'd taken our money. To clarify: I am not blaming this restaurant for the difficulty their patrons have with turning out of the bar, I am simply warning people who may come here to cautious when leaving the premises. My rating was based solely on what occurred within Devil's Advocate. As of today, April 6th, I have no received a response from the Manager.* There's something sketchy going on with the staff. The best thing about this place is price and the worst is their service. Parking isn't awful, but turning west out of the parking lot is a nightmare. I only come here when we're looking for the diviest place in town, and this place always delivers. Service: THIS was the problem. We had a middle-aged blonde serving us on a Friday night. Service was slow, and our waitress unfriendly. The worst part by far however, was her change giving ability. We had two bills at our table, and she managed to not only round down the change, but had shorted each of us a dollar. I ended up with $7 change after giving a $20 for a $11.39 bill. I was not drunk enough to miss this. I didn't bring it up because it wasn't a big enough issue that night. Let's be clear: I would've given the waitress that dollar, and more, as a tip. It was nevertheless, a little presumptive of her to just take it. Food: their bar food is alright. It's nothing to right home about, but they will guarantee you as much grease and carbs as your wallet and stomach can afford. The sweet potato fries are a favorite, as are their wings. Beer prices are cheap. Moral of this story: don't expect a lot, and pay with a credit card. You won't get your change.",0
"I used this cleaners this week to clean my Pottery Barn drapes. Everything looked great when we picked them up and the price was very reasonable. However, after getting home and going to rehang the drapes this evening I noticed that the 2 drapes were not the same length anymore. One was 96 in long when we took it in and the other was 84 in long. They are now 91 and 80 in long. I will be calling them on Monday Morning to file a complaint. I have 4 other panels that i hadn't taken in and I won't be taking them there. The color is also off. I am wondering if they laundered them instead of dry cleaning them.",0
If you think this shop will save you a few bucks on bagged liquor vs. a high priced strip casino tab think again. We stopped in for a bottle of Crown and were literally shocked at the 100% mark up. Typical large bottle is $42 over $85 here.,0
This is absolutely the WORST medical facility I have ever been to. Dr. Jeffrey Richmond is NOT friendly and does NOT take time to adequately explain pertinent information concerning your case.

He should NOT be trusted.,0
"First time, went with my dad, sad to say we were quite disappointed. We ordered the Number 1 special which contains 2 wonton soups, 4 egg rolls (with plum sauce), chicken chow mein, chicken soo guy (with cherry sauce), chicken fried rice and we ordered a plate of beef and broccoli as well. The wonton soups were bland, as were the egg rolls, and they also seemed under seasoned (tasted like they came out of a wong wing box -my dad). The chicken chow mein and beef and broccoli had a weird aftertaste, as though the pan used had burnt food on the bottom. Chicken soo guy was good although the cherry sauce tasted like it had been watered down. In the chicken fried rice we found: a bone and a tendon which was a huge turn off. (The best part was the fortune cookies - my dad). Probably won't be coming back.",0
"I used to be a frequent patron of Moxie's and have always had a good experience there, whether it is for date night, birthdays, girls'night out, etc. However, my most recent visit was disappointing to say the least and completed tainted my view of this establishment. I usually dress up when I go out, but I just finished a long shift and just wanted take-out so my coworker and I went there for just that. We went in and told the hostesses we were there for take out. They directed us to the bar and said we could order there. I went up to the bartender and asked for a kale and quinoa salad to which he looked at me without a smile and shouted, ""that's it?"" He proceeded with whatever he was doing before and completed ignored me. I wasn't even sure if he got my order or if he was just going to pretend I wasn't right in front of him. I had to find another person to fill my order but unfortunately, she wasn't any better. At least she took my order though. She did not greet me, thank me, or even speak with me except to hand over the credit card machine. I don't think it should matter if I'm dressed down or up but you just treat every customer the same. Clearly, that wasn't the case with this place. My coworker was treated exactly the same and noticed the girl next to us getting way better customer service. Even though I used to like this place, I don't know if I will ever come here again since I didn't feel appreciated as a customer. Actually, it was a very dehumanizing experience that I will be sure to share with my family and friends.",0
"This place used to be pretty good, but now not as much. The weight times are getting longer. They cut backs are noticeable and the prices keep rising. Half the time they get the food order wrong. They charge you extra if you want fries.  They don't cook your burger the way your order it. Over all too expensive! It's like they take advantage of you cause it the airport and there is not many other options.",0
"I scheduled an appointment with them to have my carpet and living room furniture cleaned.  I was very clear in my ask and instructions that I lived in a condo which was an apartment like setting.  I was given a time for between 9:30 and 1.  I made arrangements for my dog and myself to be gone so they would not be disturbed.  I got a call 11:15 they were 15 minutes away.  Then at 11:36 I got a call that they did not bring a portable unit so it would now be 1P.  At 1:28 I called the gentleman who told me 1p and he said oh, I meant to tell you between 1 and 3:30, but I'll see where they are and call u right back (I am still waiting)  Then at 1:41 I called the main office who said they would probably not be around until 4 at which point we had to cancel.  He did not do anything to try and make amends nor apologize for their inefficiency.  My husband was not happy and we wasted a whole day for naught.  If I were the business owner, I would have been making more of an effort not to loose a customer.  Also, this makes me sad, because I like to write good reviews.",0
"This location is HORRIBLE!!  After waiting 15 minutes for 10 hot wings, they told me that the fryer needed to heat up(now I came there at 7pm).  This would be okay if this type of stuff didn't happen all the time at this location. I love KFC but I think this is the last time I will waste my time going there. There are too many places near that have better service and decent chicken. Hell I can go to Public and get better chicken.",0
"I was really excited to try this place when my friend told me we were going somewhere that the AYCE included sashimi.... I was skeptical that it seemed too good to be true and I should have trusted my gut, but the prospect of endless sashimi won over and off we went.First thing, there were only 4 of us, and they asked if we wanted to sit at the sushi bar or a table, and we opted for a table so it would be easier for us to share the AYCE family style. They walked us over to a teppanyaki table and sat us down directly next to a couple who were already squeezed into the corner. I must have drawn the short straw, because I ended up basically rubbing elbows with the woman. They sensed the discomfort, too, and ended up telling the server they were leaving (they hadn't ordered anything yet) and left $1 on the table for the tea. This was the second time I should've taken the hint, but we persisted.Then we ordered. There are some items that can't be ordered as sashimi, but we got pretty much everything else sashimi style. There is a limit on the number of oysters and orders of Uni that can be ordered per person, so we initially said bring us the maximum # of uni. I had never tried it before and I suspect this wasn't the best opportunity to try it. After re-thinking how much that would be, we decided to just as for half as much to start- 8 pieces. Well, there must have been a mis-communication because they ended up bringing 16 pieces. At first, we didn't complain because we figured we'd eat it all anyway. Then we realized that the Nori:rice:uni ratio was way off. there was a TON of nori and rice, with a little bit of uni ontop. I tried one and couldn't stomach it. I can't say for sure whether it was a matter of taste, but something about it just tasted OFF to me. (red flag #3). I dismissed it, thinking maybe I just don't like uni, and trudged on. My friends ate all of the pieces, but left a good amount of rice. When they took away the plates, we got a scolding about how we have to eat the rice or we will get charged. It seemed like a warning, so we were diligent the rest of the time, eating all the rice. As it turns out, it was not a warning, and we got charged an additional $3 per person for leaving rice, so we shouldn't have worried about trying to follow the rule after that. The $3 per person seems like a lot, it seems like it should have been related to the price of the roll that the rice came from, but I dunno.The other pieces of fish were just OK. Nothing was really awesome, but nothing was horrible either. The salmon and the soft shelled crab were probably the best items. The takoyaki was also pretty good. The cajun albacore was gross, it was hard and the seasoning tasted off. The oysters were poorly opened, so there were little pieces of shell in most of them. The super white tuna had a bad texture and was really tough. For me, the worst part was at the end, when we were trying to finish what we had ordered (probably a little too much, but what is AYCE without overeating??) we were each muscling down the last few pieces of the worst items... I had the last couple of pieces from the spicy poki and that's when it happened... Maybe it is because the lower quality pieces of fish were used to chop up into the poki, maybe its because it was sitting there for 30 minutes as one of the things we had ordered earlier in the night. Either way, I put a piece of tuna in my mouth and almost threw up- it tasted rotten and I had to spit it out.When that wasn't bad enough, we got the bill... $27/person for AYCE, $3/person for leaving rice, plus tax, plus mandatory 18% gratuity for a party of FOUR or more... ended up being $152 and change (ie. $38 per person). We put in our credit cards willingly, but then told the waitress that for future reference, to be more clear on the orders, because we felt we had not ordered as much Uni as they had brought, and for us, that was the reason that we left the rice. Instead of apologizing, or offering to take of any or all of the rice charge, or even saying 'thanks for letting us know' she got defensive. and rude. and called over the manager, who continued to scold us like bad children, telling us ""we had to follow the rules"" and that THEY hadn't made a mistake, that WE needed to understand that 8 orders = 16 pieces. (we feel we ordered 8 PIECES, not 8 ORDERS, but who ever said that the customer is always right, anyway??) We even stated ""we are not disputing the charge, we just wanted you to know that there was a misunderstanding and that in the future that it could be avoided by double checking the order.""Sorry for the long rant, I probably should've stuck with ""if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.""",0

"Initially I was excited to have a Slyman's in Mentor, but I just had the worst experience. My grilled cheese had hair in it on 2 separate orders...made first time and I never took a bite because it was visible on the cheese. They made me a 2nd order and I ate one 1/2, picked up the other and there was hair on the plate, under where that 1/2 was. Waitress tried to have the order removed and the manager would not do so. She asked if we wanted to talk to the manager. When he came over, he asked me to explain whether the hair was short or long. Gross...I really don't care about the $4.99 (or whatever it was). The manager should have been there in the first place apologizing. I shouldn't have had to ask. DEFINITELY WILL NOT RETURN.",0

"If I could rate 0 stars, I would.  I don't eat sandwiches as often as I'd like since bread is not technically part of a healthy lifestyle for me.  However, we were getting ready for vacation, things were hectic and I didn't really care!  Although my first preference for subs is Jersey Mikes, Which Wich & even Subway on occasion; I've had Blimpie in the past and have had good experiences.  They are just not conveniently located where I'm at most of the time and I do prefer the ones mentioned above in that order.  It had been awhile since I had one & my husband picked it up for me since it was in the area he was running an errand.  Let me say that I am completely appalled that I had to pay ANY money for what I received let alone $6.  I had a 12 in club sub. I'd rather pay $6 for a 6 inch sub that was higher quality.  One very, thinner than paper, layer of each: turkey, ham, & cheese.  Completely disgusted & not at all satisfying.  If I wanted only a bread and veggies sub, I would go to Subway & order their veggie sub, much more satisfying.  But in a time where I'm following an eating plan that is all about protein, I've become a protein lover.  However, even a non meat lover would expect more than what I received!  From now on I will stick with the other previously mentioned places when I want to ""treat"" myself to a sandwich w/ bread! See picture of just how pathetic my sub was!",0

Because the car was towed to the shop and they understood we can't tow it back, it was inoperable!!!Rude, unapologetic, unprofessional!At toyota dealer this service price check came out to be 370$ and at other places 280$+tax.We are taking them to small claims court!!!They put rebuilt part and charged for it almost 400$, although rebuilt cost for compatible part is 118$ and at the dealer the NEW part is 219$.Then they charged 100$ for diagnostics which is not necessarily in this kind of problem. I was told by another auto shop (when the services were already done) that it is obvious that the problem is starter, so the proper way is to replace started for 280$+tax and if the problem persists then do diagnostics etc. They charged us for both!Big liers!

"I've been a big fan of Lush for a while now, but I have to say the store at Downtown Summerlin disappoints. I went in to check out this Lush store Saturday. I typically go to Mandalay Bay because the representatives are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Neat less to say, the ladies at Downtown Summerlin Lush were more concerned about dancing and not helping anyone. One of the ladies care more about the music playing and dancing, rather than help me with my questions. She told me to just choose an item since they all have the same ingredients. I was looking for a specific massage bar Lush carried in the past that is great for certain skin conditions. But according to this lady, everything is the same and left me hanging. It would have been great to get the same Lush experience I receive at Mandalay Bay. My son and I are allergic to a few items and just choosing blindly is not something we like to do.We left the store and can't say that I would go there again. The staff there needs training and customer service skills.",0
"i wish i could put ZERO stars. i had some of THE WORST service here.Looks can be deceiving. This place looks nice on the inside...Made a reso for a party of 12, waited 10 minutes after arriving while they got the tables ready, which should've already been ready for us. -_-It's understandable that it took awhile for our orders to come out since we had such a large group, but itTook the servers about 10 minutes before asking for our orders.One order didn't come out until AFTER everyone else in the party had FINISHED EATING. This is after we bugged the servers every chance we got to ask if my friend's food would be coming out soon.The rest of us felt bad about starting to eat before he had his food, but we had no choice as we were on a tight schedule and were already running late. (Good thing he's a fast eater) Weird thing is, another person in our group ordered the exact same thing, only a slightly lower level of spiciness.   The food was okay. We had to stay vigilant on when servers would pass by in order to get their attention for more water, lemon, etc. Poor guys, but i think they should have tended to us a little more often than they actually did.  To top it off, the check came with a total of $170!!!!!!!!!!! (including 18% gratuity which was calculated from the total+tax, which is WRONG). This doesn't make sense AT ALL because 4 of the 12 in our party had their own plates, while the other 8 shared with a partner. They obviously don't know how to do simple arithmetic here, and somehow they stapled some other bill on top of ours and added it together... (we knew those weren't what we ordered)So we calculated our correct bill ourselves and talked to the manager about it. Our actual bill was only about $109 total. NEVER again will i eat here.Last note, the food didn't sit well with one of my friends. He got really sick, had a rough night, fever, and threw up quite a bit throughout the remainder of the next day until we got home to San Diego :(",0

"I had been wanting to try the store since they took over the Vons store, today was the day. I managed to get two stops at the store in one trip, my first and last. The fact that the parking lot was a ghost town at 3 in the afternoon, should have been a hint.Their prices are outrageously high, figure on paying 1.5 to 2.5 times as much for any item, compared to Albertsons or Smiths. Comparing items on sale, they are still 1.25 to 2.0 times higher than Albertsons or Smiths on sale price. I'm talking exact same products, in both the above comparisons. This was true for the bakery, deli, produce, meat, etc, basically everything in the store is over priced for the Las Vegas market.I remember many years ago Raleys came to town, they came from Northern California and were charging Northern California prices in Las Vegas, it didn't work then, it won't work now. By the time Raleys realized they needed to lower their prices, it was too late, they had already lost their customer base. The Las Vegas stores closed. I expect the same thing to happen to Haggen, if they don't address the problem immediately.They had fresh ground sausage on sale according to the flyer, I searched and could not find it, so I went to the meat counter rang the bell three times to no avail, called the store on my cell phone, line busy, finally found an employee, she got on the PA system, finally the butcher showed up, I asked where the sausage was and he explained that, ""I didn't make any. It was on sale a few weeks ago, it didn't sell very well, so I stopped making it"". I believe in empowering employees, but this type of autonomy, where they can arbitrarily not make an item they are advertising, is not empowering the employee, it's showing a complete lack of respect, consideration and concern for the customer.It's been mentioned in other reviews, but I noticed the 2 days left on the milk this was a premium brand, their own brand had 11 days left, if I came back in 9 days their brand would probably only have 2 days left.I went to check out, there was only one line open, since there was less than a dozen customers in the store, it was more than enough. This was at 3:30 in the afternoon.In general this store is pathetic, as I said I've been planning to come here since the change back in June, but it appears at least this store is already in a death spiral. They came in with high prices and lost the customer base, no one is going to pay twice as much for the same food they can get at Albertsons or Smiths. They are so short staffed they can't keep the product fresh, maybe they can't afford staff due to loss of sales, due to high prices. And the staff they do have are over empowered to make decisions such as disregarding corporate's decision on sales items.If you like to throw away money paying higher prices on questionably fresh product, this may be the store for you, it's not for me, I won't be back. I'll just sit back and watch the place implode under the incompetence.",0
"Sometimes when I eat I enjoy going out on my own. As a concierge at one of the hotels in old town Scottsdale it is important to me to try all the restaurants in town so I have places to recommend. based on my experience Arcadia farms is off that list.So today I passed a test I've preparing for for over a year and thought it would be great to celebrate with a delicious meal at a place I've wanted to try for so long now! I walked in to arcadia farms market place first and the girl working was so sweet and helpful. I should have just eaten there. I didnt eat there though because I really wanted to sit down with a mimosa (my favorite) and enjoy a meal. As I walked in to the restaurant the hostess looked at me like I was crazy when I told her it was just me. she had to process the fact that I was a solo diner for a good minute. I asked if I could sit outside and she sat me in a spot directly in the sun. I was so hot! Arcadia farms looks adorable and the menu looked fantastic so I figured I could be a little warm as long as I had a cold beverage. I sat, and I sat and I sat. Still no server, no water, no anything. I sat for a good 15 minutes at least. I even witnessed the table next to me get helped twice and the table across from me was served drinks and had their orders taken from the women that sat me.  Needless to say I got up and left without the meal I've been hoping for for so long. 15 minutes without even water on the table is laughable. Apparently eating alone is not acceptable at Arcadia Farms. I considered going back to order at the market place but I honestly don't want to give the company my money at all anymore. I went to eat down the street and had a wonderful experience with water on my table faster than arcadia farms hostess could even say hello.I will never be back and I will never recommend this place to my guests.",0
"DO NOT GO TO THIS SHOP. I purchased a $500 giftcard that was supposed to be doubled for $1000 of work with the so wonderful SCOTT VERSAGO. He canceled my first appointment and reschedule 2 months later. FInally had my 1st session and he was unable to finish it because he started late, not my problem you take forever to make a template and then take several smoke breaks. Then the day before my 2nd appointment he cancels because he ""may have broke his ankle"" um ok you tattoo sitting down. Told me he would contact me the following Tuesday and he never did. So I contacted him that Wednesday and no response. Turns out he does this all the time with these ""special deals"" and giftcards. I spoke with an artist at a different shop and he knew exactly the artist was before I even said his name. He asked was it Scott? and when I told him yes he said that is why he and 6 other artists left empire and opened their own shop because once Scott gets your money upfront you can kiss it goodbye. Yes he does good work but he doesn't finish it. My tattoo is half done. He STOLE from me. Please do not go to this shop. After talking to friends on facebook I know of atleast 10 others he has done this too. He is a piece of shit and a sorry excuse for a tattoo artist.",0
"I had their corn beef and cabbage at 400 in the afternoon.  Don't bother.  In my experience cabbage should be a vibrant green, soft but with some semblance of structure remaining.  An olive green heap is not the desired outcome.  Alternatively, the beef should be tender enough to cut with a fork, my first hint was that it was served with a meat knife.  Just my opinion.",0
"What was susposed  to be a two week project, to retile and replaster our pool, has turned into at least 4 weeks. We also didn't get the pump we wanted. This was all caused when shasta put in the wrong pump in the beginning. Their attitude has been, well it isn't swimming season anyway right now. I would never use this company again or recommend them to anyone. The pump they installed is so bad it doesn't even have enough power to clean my pool.",0
"I'm warning you now...get a price for everything and then get a 2nd opinion.   I went in for foot pain at the Central Phoenix location and was told that I had a ruptured ligament that was as bad as it could get.  This was after he stabbed his thumbs into my instep and made me cry.  Don't make any long term decisions high in cost until you have had the time to get over the pain inflicted in the preliminary exam.  I am still in dispute over the $60 charged for the sock liner that went inside the boot (the boot that I was told by my second opinion that I never needed in the first place) which I would have thought would be included in the price.  No.  The sock that retails online for $7 had an allowable price of $35 by insurance, which I am responsible for since all supply items went towards the deductible.  Regular knee highs work just fine folks.  My 2nd opinion also told me the ultrasound done in office wasn't needed since he already had all the info he needed by his intrusive hands-on exam, and the orthotics that the first doctor was pushing on me for $450 were not needed either.  I ended up buying $45 inserts for my tennis shoes that hardly get any use and so far the foot is doing great after finishing treatment with the 2nd doctor.  I was so desperate for pain relief that I almost bought into Dr. Lee's game; but when he actually got angry at me for refusing the orthotics at the 2nd visit (after waiting on him for an hour and a half) I realized this one was NOT a keeper.  Hopefully this review will give you the opportunity to avoid a lot of unnecessary pain, inconvenience and charges.",0
"Don't go here if you have a choice of places to go for service/repairs.  I recently had my car worked on there.  I would rather have teeth pulled out without Novocain than go back there.  My 8 day experience for a repair of one part started with an appointment on Monday at 1:00 p.m.  The car was not looked at until Wednesday afternoon.  Not sure if they understand what an appointment is.  8 days later (and many other issues-too many to list here), we picked up the car which now smelled like smoke (we don't smoke) and had several rattles that were not there when we took the car in.Customer service was terrible.  It appears that ONLY the Service Rep that is assigned to you knows about your repairs.  There is no central information system that shows any type of status, in case your Service Rep was not available. Also, evidently, it's good customer service at Ford Country to TEXT a customer that they owe $2K for the repair; then TEXT the customer they are too busy to CALL them to discuss this bill. The entire experience was ridiculous.  When I mentioned it to another Service Rep who was trying to deal with me when my original Service Rep was out ill, his response was ""We hear that all of the time"".  Maybe that is a clue! Save yourself the frustration, valuable time and money--go some where else.",0
"Went to order a car stereo for a Xmas gift.  Nobody there.  Ok I see the hours posted fine, I will come back.  I go back.  Nobody there.  I find another associate and say where are they?  I'm going to go elsewhere.  He offers to help and schedule me.  He sets me up for a date I wanted 3 weeks into the future. Except he schedules me at 9am.  I get there at my appointed time.  Guess what Best Buy is not open.  They open at 10.  At 10 I go in and the installer tells me I am not on the schedule.  Well..I do have a piece of paper that tells me when to be there.  He tells me the lady next to me has the 10am appt and she's been set for week.  ok I have 9am and I've been set for 3 weeks.  He tells me about 4 hours.  I call back 3 1/2 hours later...hasn't even started it yet. Needs the car another 5 hours.   Been busy with people on the schedule.  Hello...what do you not get about your schedule....I have an appt too!!!  I go and pick up my car... going elsewhere.  Employees really seem to be lacking in understanding that there is a problem here and think outside the box to fix it before it blows up.  He should have called his manager and said there's a problem here...can I offer this guy something to reschedule and apologize. Then it would not have been such a big deal and such a frustrating experience.  By the way...saying I'm sorry is a good way to start.  Hey Best Buy...buying a 72"" tv in a couple of days...not from you!!!",0
"They left my 17 yr old's luggage 1,500 miles away in another state!!!! She went on vacation for her birthday and we paid extra for a checked bag a month ago when we bought the ticket. She stood in line on her way home to check her bag and the lady at the airport said they don't have room on the plane for her bag and she has to have someone pick it up!! She tried to explain to them that she didn't live there and she already paid for her luggage a month ago!! The lady was extremely rude and said she has to have someone come pick it up because they're not responsible for it and can't put it on the plane!!! My daughter is 17 and traveling alone and had no idea what was going on!! I try calling the airline and can't get through to anyone. Meanwhile she's having a panic attack on the plane and her luggage is stuck at the airport. Not sure why they couldn't save room for her luggage since we already paid for it??!! Or why they couldn't put it on the next flight out??!! Or maybe give me a phone number I can get through to in case of emergencies??!! BUT... ON TOP OF THAT.... while taxing to the runway a message comes over the intercom that says THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE LUGGAGE ON THE PLANE AND THEY HAVE TO GO BACK!!!! So the plane turns around and goes back to the gate so the guys can put everyone else's luggage on the plane, but not my daughters, haha!! At least the other passengers will have their stuff when they get to Phoenix!! Do not use this airline if you can avoid it. They have the ABSOLUTE WORST customer service of all the airlines, and by the time all the fees add up with luggage and carryon fees plus taxes they don't save you any money at all!! If you care about your belongings getting to you safely and customer service, DEFINITELY DON'T USE THIS AIRLINE!!!!",0
"Why did I bother? I'm not a fan of chains by any means but the ONE thing that chains do offer is consistency and decent service. Tonight I had a strange craving for a Margarita and something protein based like burger or steak. As I debated over where to go, I thought...I have no make up on and I just want food that I can count on and someone else to cook and serve. I figured, what the heck a Chili's would probably be exactly what the doctor ordered. Quick in...grab a Margarita, burger, relaxation, head home...That isn't what I gotI walked in and sat down at the bar. The bartender somehow didn't see me walkin with the whole 6 other people sitting there. I sat down and waited and waited and waited...long enough that I got frustrated and started watching him only to see him watching the basketball game. Yeah that wasn't making the situation better. A good 5 minutes after I sat down he FINALLY noticed me and came over fumbling with menus. By the way, never apologizing for not seeing me there. He asks me what I want to drink and I ask for water while I look at the menu. This takes unbelievably long with him putsing around doing random tasks while I wait...He finally comes back with some water when I order a Presidente Margarita and then very clearly order a burger rare, no bun, and sub broccoli for the fries. He seems like he heard it all and goes off to spend several minutes on the POS and mixing my drink. When the margarita arrives I figure things will now be ok and turn around. I mean really how much more can he do wrong?I play on my phone for a few when the food arrives. I see the fries and ask the girl who brought them if she could get me broccoli instead. At  this VERY SECOND she and bartender disappear to the kitchen leaving me with my sad burger patty (seriously Chilis you charge people $9 for THAT little piece of burger?) getting colder and colder since he never bothered to bring me a knife and fork. As I sit there for a good 5 minutes wishing I had gotten at least a ""Oh I'm sorry. Let me fix that but here's a knife and fork so you can eat while I'm in the kitchen"" I start to get irritated AGAIN. At this point I'm just over it all. I came here for simple, easy and consistent. Instead I got irritation, ignored, and mediocre.When he finally comes back with the broccoli and FINALLY offers me a knife and fork, I push back the plate, offer to pay for my drink, and tell him this was NOT what I wanted when I came out to eat...Instead I came home and cooked which was EXACTLY what I did NOT want to do.In the end I was so irritated by the whole situation that I can guarantee that I will NEVER walk into this location again and I have hesitations to ever go into any Chili's again. I just wanted someone to acknowledge that I sat down, get me some food, and know that a fork would be nice BEFORE the food was cold. In a city built on service, you would think I wouldn't have to want for that scenario.",0
"Ordered the Carnitas burrito, as well as the steak burrito. I also ordrered the cheese quesadillas with chicken.The pork was WAY TOO SALTY!  I couldn't finish it without drinking a ton.Figured that it was a fluke from a heavy-handed cook with that one particular burrito, so dug into the steak, and found it to be just as as salty. What a disappointment.The quesadillas were not bad.However, with how salty the two  burritos were, I can not recommend Desert Springs.",0
"I am astounded by all of the rave reviews.  My husband and I recently had dinner here.  The food was mediocre at best.  The worst part, however, was not the food, but the flies.  We ate inside and there were flies everywhere.  Then, we started noticing something odd.  We were seated by a window.  Whenever one of the flies buzzing around our heads would land on the window, the fly would drop to the window sill and die almost immediately.  After this happened several times, we asked the waitress about it, who gave some type of evasive non-answer.  Clearly the restaurant management is coating the windows with something that is meant to kill the flies.  Whatever chemical is killing the flies, cannot be good for humans.  So, if you have children, keep them away from the windows.  Aside from our concern over what chemical we might be exposed to, it was very off-putting to watch fly after fly drop and spin in the ""death throws"" while we were trying to eat.  In the end, nice concept, but actual experience was way below expectation.",0

Have to decrease another star now. Their latest tactic is to pretend you didn't pay a membership each time you come in. They don't keep any records of you paying the 20.00 membership. So each time you come in they claim they have no record of you and try to charge you 20.00 over and over. I now have to keep the bank statement from months ago showing the 20.00 membership charge in my glove compartment in my car just to prove to them that yes i am a member. They're about to lose a long time customer.,0
"My sister and I ate at Lotus of Siam about a year ago.  In a word, the place was 'TERRIBLE'!I regularly eat in upscale and hole in the wall Thai restaurants here in Atlanta and they all are a million times better than Lotus of Siam.  Yeah, I believed all the hype about this being the best Thai food in the country.  However, my sister and I quickly learned it was just hype.We had the lunch buffet.  We tried every thing on the buffet (Not hard to do because there's not much on the buffet anyway) from the different currys to the chicken, and rice offerings and every thing was a huge dissapointment.  My sister got sick on the way back to our hotel and we had to rush her to the first hotel we saw on the strip so she could go to the restroom to throw up.  I gave it one star for the cold ice water like a previous person said.If you love good Thai food and you're used to eating good Thai food then DO NOT EAT AT LOTUS OF SIAM!",0
"Service was okay.But my friend and I can't say a single positive thing about the food.  She had the steak, pepper skillet hash. I had the Florentine Benedict.Both came with the hash browns which are a deep fried pressed Hockey puck of overcooked potatoes. There was no potatoey fluffiness left, just a nasty dense grease of dark brown food.Her steak was also overcooked and tough and in no way resembled a hash: steak chunks on one side, the hockey pucks, peppers and onions on the other side. It looked unappetizing.My spinach was not sautéed, but suffered a hot water bath. That water wasn't properly drained and grey green water soaked the bottom English muffin so much no runny egg could be sopped up. The egg still had loose whites, and I don't remember a Hollandaise sauce. If it was there, there wasn't much. The tomatoes were tasty though.Both my friend and I commented that the food really wasn't good several times. We didn't finish. Outside, again we said the food was really bad. We shopped. Then again remarked how bad the food was, because the taste wasn't leaving us.Never ever again. There are so many great breakfast/ bunch places around why do the chain Cafe Hollander.",0

"Man, I can't remember having soondubu this bad in quite a long time. I've been spoiled with really good soondubu in LA (Ktown) and Orange County, but this place is just a disgrace to Korean cuisine. My wife and I ordered the exact same mixed soondubu spicy, and yet, hers tasted burnt and mine was just straight up terrible. It was bland and tasted like tap water. Wtf. The banchan, especially the japchae, looked like it was saved since the Josean era. It was as bad as it looked, dry as a MF. Rice didn't come in a stone pot, and when we asked the server why it didn't, she said because we didn't ask. Lol smfh. For a place that's called tofu hut, I ought to kick the tofu out of this hut. Never comin back.",0
"Like many other reviewers here, I don't know what is happening with their exterior only vs full service.  The full-service seems to take forever. I am third in line, but the line has not moved in 10 minutes and yet there are employees walking outside the building all over the place, I have no idea what they're doing. The exterior only lane sure zips by quickly, but I am here to get the inside vacuumed out as well... So is that my punishment? I am a fairly tolerant person but a herd of tortoises could walk through this car wash at a faster pace.Another five minutes, my line still hasn't moved. Time to find a new car wash place.",0
"After months of searching for a car,  my boyfriend and I became very interested in purchasing a used Honda from a private seller. However, since we are novice car buyers, we knew we needed to get a Pre-Purchase Inspection done to ensure that we are aware of all potential issues. What better place to get it done than a Honda dealership, we reasoned, since surely the mechanics there would have thorough and expert knowledge of Hondas.So we called Scott Clark Honda. The employee who answered said that we could get a free Multi-Point Inspection, but then he realized that we needed a Pre-Purchase Inspection (which is supposed to be far more thorough so that there are no surprises after purchasing the vehicle). We set up an appointment with Service Advisor Scott Hall, who told us that during the inspection, the car would be examined with a ""fine-tooth comb"" to find flaws (meant metaphorically). Even though the Multi-Point Inspection was free, we felt that $95 for the Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI) would be well worth the peace of mind it would provide. He told us to ""ask for Scott"" when we arrived.We set off to the dealership this morning. Scott said he recognized us from the phone call and checked us in. He said that the inspection would be able to tell us whether the car was worth buying. So my boyfriend and I waited in the waiting room and joked about the technician somehow missing the very obvious problems about the car that we had already noticed (such as the windshield wiper fluid not spraying at all, the missing rear wiper arm, the two missing rear headrests, the water in the trunk, & the interior light not turning on). We laughed because we knew that would be impossible--Scott had promised that the car was going to be inspected with a ""fine tooth comb""!But we shouldn't have been so sure. After an hour, Scott told us that the inspection was complete. He gave us a piece of paper titled ""Multi-Point Vehicle Health Check,"" said that the car looked good overall and pointed out that the car needed an oil change, new filters, and the tires might need replacing at some point. We waited for him to continue...but he stopped there. So we pointed out all the blatant problems with the car that we had noticed previously. Scott said, ""Okay, let me ask the technician to check out those problems and give you a price on the missing headrests and the wiper."" He talked to technician for a minute and came back, telling us that it wouldn't take long. So we went back to the waiting room, feeling incredulous. How could a Pre-Purchase Inspection cost $95 when it was exactly the same thing as the free Multi-check inspection, plus a test drive? Where was the super thorough ""fine tooth comb"" inspection we were promised? How could we have confidence in the car, knowing that the technician had overlooked so many issues? Maybe Scott forgot to tell us about all of the other things that the technician had checked.When Scott  returned, I asked him if I could see a checklist of what was completed. I pointed out that on their site, it said that all of their used cars had been given a 150-Point Inspection (clearly, the vehicle I was buying wasn't from them, but the Pre-Purchase Inspection service must be at least a little similar to the 150-Point Inspection, right?), and I requested to see a checklist of everything that was examined during the PPI. Scott said that the Multi-Point Vehicle Inspection was the only checklist of things the technician had examined. I pointed out that this was the exact same checklist that they used for the free Multi-Point Inspection, and asked what the difference was between that and the PPI. He said that the technician had test-driven the car. My boyfriend pointed out that the technician had missed many, many problems with the car. ""What do you want me to do?"" asked Scott. I noted that the PPI provided no reassurance to us at all, and we honestly felt no better off than before the inspection. ""I can take off the charge,"" offered Scott reluctantly.Since one of our major concerns about the car was the engine, we asked for a compression test to be completed (with great doubts, considering the quality of service provided thus far). We were quoted $50. Then we waited again. Scott came back early to ask for the receipt he had given me earlier, so he could take off the charge. He returned again later when the car was ready. He said that the PPI and the compression test would be free. Though we did appreciate this, it felt like we would've been far better off going ANYWHERE else to get the PPI done, and we shouldn't really have been charged anyways. TL;DR If you're looking for a used car, do NOT get a Pre-Purchase Inspection done here. They will NOT do a thorough job (at all). And perhaps you could extrapolate my experience and not get any services done here at all, if you can help it.",0
"The new management is terrible.  The leasing agents are rude, stuck up and are not helpful.  Maintenance repairs and additional requests don't get done.

"Went to Zupas for the first time and was extremely disappointed.  The food served didn't match the pictures of the food on the wall in the least which was very confusing.  I ordered Lobster Bisque soup, got something that didn't look like Bisque at all, but when I asked if a mistake had been made the counter person argued with me and didn't listen to my concerns.  Ambience is mixed, they want you to feel comfortable dining in but the plastic silverware and multiple tables sitting with the remnants of meals for an extended period of time makes me feel uncomfortable and rush to leave.  The service was simply disinterested, teenagers chatting with each other and ignoring the customers.In summary this was a hugely disappointing visit and I would strongly not recommend Zupas as a dining choice due to so-so food and very poor service.",0
"i was recommended to Denise by one of my close friends. my hair had been so messed up by the last two stylists I had seen so I was looking for someone new. I texted her what I want and she said okay and to come in. When I got there we discussed what I wanted which was an ombre that matched my roots which are dirty blonde going to light blonde hair. I had greenish ash color on my ends and some reddish blonde near my head that the previous stylists messed up, but I had three months of growth. Denise didnt change my hair hardly at all, it looked nothing like the picture but I thought I would leave and give it a chance. When i got home the dye job was spotty on the sides so I texted her asking if she could redo it. She did not respond so the next day I called her and as soon as we got on the phone she started yelling at me telling me she did everything she said she was going to do. My family and friends didnt even know I got my hair done because it looked so much the same. It looks nothing like an ombre. Denise was the rudest stylist I have ever encountered and I honestly feel traumatized after having her do my hair.",0

"My boyfriend and I have lived here since April 2018. We had to transfer units, therefore signing a new lease, in February 2019. The people that work here do not care about the residents. The phone is NEVER answered. They always give you a hassle when any work needs to be done in the apartment. Our first unit, the dryer was CONSTANTLY broken. When we would tel them, it would take over a month for them to even send someone out to inspect it. In our current unit we moved into the unit not being fully ""move in ready"" we told them. This included the blinds being broken in the second bedroom. They did not fix until about FOUR MONTHS after we moved in. During the process of signing both leases we had many issues with the staff not communicating and therefore giving us incorrect information. The first time was not as bad as the second. During the second time they kept telling us new prices and even after confirming and having the price breakdown sheet confirmed, they gave us a DIFFERENT price the DAY WE WERE MOVING. They units are nice, but extremely over priced. And it is NOT because of the area. They try to pride themselves on the amenities, but not everyone will use them. I feel very disappointed with this apartment complex and can not wait till this lease is done with.",0
"Stopped in the office Saturday 9/20/14 about 12:50 to pay my October that was not due until 10/1/14. (10 days early) I have no clue who was in the manager office, or who the girl was at the front desk.  I was not greeted nor was I even acknowledged that I had walked into the room.  I finally said, I am here to pay my rent, the girl at the front desk responded with a nasty attitude and muttered something out of her mouth that I could not quite understand...I then said, my rent is not due until the first, can I please have a copy of my check. She made a copy of the check, signed the copy and handed it to me, I said thank you, have a nice day and walked out. The girl hurried behind me with her car keys in hand.....(I guess me, the customer, walking in to pay my rent got in her way and obviously inconvenienced her.) I don't understand why it is such a repeated burden for this company to to receive rent payments early?I have always paid in full and early (check the ledger Trinity).  I don't understand how this corporate company does not demonstrate any professionalism within the staff they put into place at the Dwell. Why would you allow your staff to treat a consistently well paying, rule abiding tenant this way?  Is common courtesy and professionalism thrown in with some customer service way to much for a Dwell tenant to anticipate?",0
Not impressed by staff at Scarborough town centre Walmart. I was minding my own looking for gifts..Some overly sized tattooed man in the electronics department was literally yelling at what sounded like a co-worker. I was pretty surprised that no one seemed to have cared and continued to let this happen. The lady he yelled at honestly looked helpless...I over heard him muttering racial and profane slurs under his breath.

Was seated quickly, even though the waitress didn't look like she had a lot of training...The decor was fitting towards the theme - big murals of seafood and even seafood catching cages on the side to divide the restaurant. Bibs, plastic gloves and a roll of tissue was provided per table. The Boil Bar also has a partnership with Presotea, so you can get your bubble tea fix here as well! Though, the menu is very limited.Menu is fairly simple: pick your seafood, then pick your flavoured sauce and lastly, spice level.They also had options of sizzling plate, which could come with a side of boiled seafood. Sides of corn, fries, onion rings, edamame (which I find to be a weird combination with boiled seafood), etc. Even other dishes like baked lobster, baked mussels, and seafood fried rice is available!We went with....- 1 Mussel - cajun sauce, mild spicy- 1 Crawfish - house sauce, mild spicy- 1 Lobster - garlic sauce, mild spicyWe ordered it ""a bit spicy"", but when they printed our order and pasted it on the side of our table, it said ""mild spicy"". We went mild spicy as our ""highest"" level of spice, because I don't want to ruin our meal if we couldn't handle the level of spice.First that came was the mussels, and they came pretty quick after our order. Slowly after was the crawfish, and the lobster. All of our food came pipping hot, and we had to let it cool down a bit before trying to munch on it.Sad to say but the mussels were probably my favourite part of the meal - and it shouldn't be the favourite part of the meal since we wanted lobster to be our main dish. Mussels were great because the cajun sauce was really soaked in, and was probably the best sauce in my opinion!The lobster given only had 2-3 pieces of meat (rest were shells or inedible), which was disappointing for $30. Garlic sauce is typical to me, and is nothing of a unique taste. Crawfish was a slight disappointment for me because I had high hopes about it, seeing people in the USA eating it all the time - it just turned out to be decent and I could barely taste ""house sauce"". Maybe it's the cajun sauce overpowered (??) it since the mussels did come before the other 2 dishes. Our total came up to $74 (tips included) - we didn't even order bubble tea, just the food!Other cons included: being hard to tear off the tissue off the tissue roll with messy gloves + the sauce soaked through the plastic gloves after the end of the meal + for a place with this eating style, you'd think they'll have more than one washroom. Plus, we went during a down time period.. imagine when it's busy and more people need to use the washroom to wash their hands, etc.As our first experience doing boiled seafood, we left feeling very unsatisfied because we were pretty hungry when we got there, and for the end bill of $74, we thought we'd have our tummies filled. We didn't order any side dishes because we didn't want to get full eating off fries, because if we did, we'd just go to McDonald's.The thing is: I have never been to a boiled seafood restaurant before, so I don't know if the norm of going to places like this is to spend a certain amount or if people just order more of the little stuff like shrimps, mussels, clams, fries instead of lobsters and crabs...After this encounter, it's making me really want to try Captain's Boil to have a comparison with The Boil Bar!!",0
My frist time staying on a low budget hotel and it wasn't a pleasant stay no wonder it only has 3 stars or less. They where rude and dose not care of there guest. They harass me and my mother they made us feel like slums and they had no respect just pay a lil bit more and stay some where else,0
Poor welcome.Poor service.The phad thai came without tofu!!The lasy at the entrance didnot even have a smile.The waitress seemed in immense hurry and even forced me to talk when I have foof in my mouth!Aas if we are here to impress them!!!Quantity is way too less for 12 dollars!!No soup free no salad free nothing!!!The people in the neighbouring table were beavhing like wild animals and talking loudly but nothing was doen to stop themI promptly rewarded them wth ZERO tip!!,0
"If I could rate something lower than a single star, I would rate this zero. I've been to Swiss Chalet approx. 15 times and have never sent food back. Today, I had to.Two of us wandered in and I ordered a quarter chicken white meat, with fries. My dining companion ordered the roast beef on a Kaiser. We waited a normal time frame for our meal to arrive, but when it did, I was totally grossed out. My chicken was pink on its edges....and when I peeled the skin back it was completely off-putting. The meat under the skin was mottled pink...blotches of red and pink mixed across the top of the meat. I was totally grossed out. Not sure if it was still uncooked in spots, or whether it was a very poor quality cut, but it was totally gross. I'm surprised a staff member would even bring it out as you could see the colouring even without peeling the skin back.I flagged down our server and she came over and had the gall to say ""all our chicken is cooked thoroughly"". I told her that I didn't care...I wasn't eating it and that I never said it wasn't cooked. She quickly changed her tune and said ""of course I'll take it back"". She brought over a separate plate for me to put the meat on....and off she went. She returned a few minutes later with a chicken I was expecting originally. My friend said his roast beef was ""excellent"", but after seeing my chicken breast, he said that he'd never return to this location again.Service was average. Our server was adequate, although her initial response to my concern was way off base.Don't think I'll go back, unless I need to lose weight and need a bout of food poisoning to shake those few last pounds. Yikes !",0
This is terrible.  The food is very bland and service is very slow.  The employees act like they're the only restaurant in town.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.,0
"Very rude staff. One or two of the people who work here are friendly, however the negative people outweigh the positive. The quality of the coffee is mediocre and a little over priced to be honest. However, the atmosphere is the best in Las Vegas. But if you feel uncomfortable the whole time you are in there, what good is atmosphere? I tried this shop 4 times, and have been disappointed each time.",0
"I have been staying in the hotel, with my family at Cleveland Clinic.  This is the main restaurant at the Intercontinental Hotel and BEYOND a disappointment!!  This is an expensive restaurant and most would have certain expectations. Tuesday night w4 of us came in for dinner.  There is an Asian pork & shrimp noodle dish on the menu- sounds good.  I order with extra shrimp or chicken- no pork- as I do not eat for religious reasons.  Ten minutes later the waiter comes back and says- sorry- -it is made with pork broth so guess it won't work.  Don't you think he should have known that?  I then ordered the roast chicken.  It was absolutely inedible!  There was so much cilantro on the chicken that was all that you could taste.  It did nothing good for the chicken.  Then I ordered sushi- -had a spider roll.  The ends were great with fried soft-shell crab- -the inner pieces- had tempura crunch- no crab.  Never once did the manager come over.  No apologies--not anything!!!So tonight left the hospital at 9:15-- where do you go- -the hotel again.  We ask what the soup of the day is- -we are told ""something & ham""- -I say I cannot eat ham/pork.  He suggests the vegetarian Spring Onion soup.  Get the soup- -a few bites in, see a piece I assume is bread- -take a bite and it is chorizo!! For someone who cannot eat pork- -not a good thing! Barely get an apology- but bring a new bowl.  At the end of the meal the bill comes- -guess what - the soup is still on it! I demand it be taken off.  Again-- no manager- nothing!The only redeeming quality about the place- - a very friendly and helpful bartender- Grace!  Thank you for trying to make my experience better!!",0
Went for lunch on Sunday. Service was absolutely terrible took about 15 mins to get our server to come out and good luck trying to get napkins or a refill on your drink.,0
"I would not recommend The Groutmisth. The owner who initially came out seemed very knowledgeable however the ""technician"" sent out to do the job was a teenager who told me he had only been doing this for just over a month. Unfortunately, his lack of skill showed and it seems the old grout was simply painted over with the new color. Very messy job- grout was stuck to the face of several of the tiles in my shower and has started to peel off as well. Very dissatisfied.",0
"Quoted me over $1000 to replace an ignition switch that cost $300 from another vendor. Quoted me $500-1000 more to replace my furnace as well. Basically, they tried to trick me into buying a new, overpriced furnace from them by lying about the cost of repairing the old unit. I would never do business with anyone at this firm again.",0
"Horrible. Went in to go see how much it would cost to tailor a prom dress, lady told me $30. Calls me a week later and says $60. Had no other choice than to get it there because it was a week later and I had no time. Got it back, and it still doesn't fit correctly after the alterations. You could probably find somewhere else that's cheaper.",0
Don't go there. It's another Vegas rip off. Came with my GF. Absolutely no class. Customer service is terrible. Every step cost $$$. Lots of hungry males looking to see a pair of boobs. What a shame. It's not a Europe where to be topless is a norm. Better go to a normal pool and avoid this place.,0
"As the one star slogan states - ""eek methinks not"". I came here in the summer with a friend and sat on the rooftop patio which had a nice vibe to it. The service was as bad as an 80's horror b-movie. Not ironically bad or purposefully aloof but just plain awful - minus any cool special effects. We were sat, analyzed the menu for 20 mins, no server. Looked at the menu for another 10 mins, still no server. 30 mins of waiting to order I called the host who was nice enough to take our order, and subsequently bring us our wine, and then our appetizers. A bus boy brought our mains. Our server Jennifer FINALLY came and revealed herself as the girl who had been hanging around the bar talking to the bartender for the past hour.The food was o.k. I ordered the cheese plate and the tuna tartare, both were portioned on the small side. There was one particularly good cheese - an aged goat from Quebec. My friend ordered pasta, it was ok.I wish I could like it here, but I'm horrified at the thought of going back and getting hypoglycaemic from waiting for so long for little morsels of cheese.",0
"This is my least favorite Burger King in the entire world. I ate there once a year ago, and the fries were old and cold, and tasted like an entire bag of salt was dumped on them. The burger was bland, except for the taste of salt. Even in a small town (Sun Prairie), the parking lot somehow manages to get swamped with diesel fumes--must be the wind blowing off Highway 151.I decided to try it again today, wondering if it was just a random bad experience. No. They made fresh fries, and so I didn't mind waiting 15 minutes at the window. The guy behind me in the drive through looked like he minded. I had the opportunity during the extended wait to notice that all of the cars behind me were driven by the truly obese--with fat billowing out of their shirts, with faces that became chins that became torsos, without a clear definition of where one stopped, and the next began--extreme, even for Wisconsin.The fries were fresh, and salty to the point that my gums hurt. The burger completely fell apart, and was bland, except for the overwhelming taste of salt. The bread was stale. I guess that was a second flavor, that I could taste through the salt. So the Whopper tasted like salty, stale bread, which disintegrated, somehow appropriately.I realize I'm being a drama queen, but I drove home and took a shower.",0
The worst customer service ever I got. I love M.A.C product... but I hate this location... I won't come back...,0
"I went in for glasses and they could not get it right.  I saw both the male and female docs too.  They kept sending the glasses out to get fixed.  This is the first place in the 40 years I've worn glasses where they had to send it out again and again to get it right and it's still not right so I'm going elsewhere.  This is ridiculous.  I found out from a lens maker that some docs pay more for lens makers who get it right the first time, but this company does not so they're trying to make a buck by taking up your time with a cheaper lens manufacturer.  They're in an expensive location so they're trying to appear like quality, but now that I know the secret, no thanks.",0
"I wish I could give them no stars.I arrived at 8:07 to discover the doors had been locked to the restaurant and the drive thru was shut down. No one responded to phone calls and there were people hiding out in the kitchen. Real professional, folks.",0
"Worst online store ive ever bought from. Every time i order they take forever to ship..always replying they cant find the item. I told them to cancel that item and they still haven't shipped. Had to file a PayPal claim and possibly wait weeks for dispute process to be resolved. Shop at entertainment earth, bigbadtoystore, or even Amazon.com instead.",0
"Service tried to hard- 6 visits between manager and waitress. Waitress nice but screed up our orders and didn't even realize she delivered wrong items. Food dry and flavor less . Overall waste of time and money. Portions so small .... Salad was fresh and tea tastes good , hence the 1 Star",0
"For a place that claims best pizza in America (rolls eyes) this place is really full of it. Welcome to modern American marketing post self-esteem movement. If I say something is true about myself, it IS true don't cha know. No person who's had ANY pizza in NYC would think this pretentious over priced and frankly snotty boutique pizza shop was anywhere near the best. I can think of many that are better. Anthony's in Denver Colorado smokes this. Wiseguy in DC the same. Shit even Hanny's downtown here is far better.The best?The fucking balls....In case you're wondering, the best is probably Joe's in the West Village. NYC. Go there. Before you die. You're welcome. And it's inexpensive! It shouldn't be. Unpretentious....Pizza the way it has always been made from way before hipsters started to ""reinvent"" it and then call it more ""authentic"" so that they can then feel superior (as usual) and charge you more. And by the way it's not in Italy either, I've been there... Having a few somewhat decent pies right there in Rome and Trastevere. Most notably Dar Poeta in Trastevere.If you want Middle School cafeteria grade pizza with watery sauce and T O N S of attitude, visit this place. You'll love it.Come on did you really think the best pizza in America would be in Phoenix Arizona?Right.",0
"SCAM SCAM SCAM!!! DON'T BELIVE THE ""YOU CAN CANCEL IN FIVE MONTHS B.S. IT'S MORE LIKE 8 MONTHS!!!! I signed up in February for a ""five month membership trial"", my first monthly payment came out in March along with new membership fee. After several months of never being able to get in for the services I was interested in and asking the manager Michelle to please help me figure out why I couldn't access my online account to help me book my appointments in advance to get in and never hearing anything back in return I gave up and asked an associate Amy in May when and what I need to do to cancel she explained I would have to come in on any Saturday after the first of July because that would be after my fifth payment, I than wrote it down in front of her and said okay thank you. Today I call to talk to a manager to confirm that I would be coming in to cancel next week and I got Amy on the phone and she told me that I could not cancel until next month...I asked why and told her that I had previously spoken with her and about canceling in July and her response was you didn't talk to me...WOW! what a professional response I was than put on hold while she got her assistant manager Amanda. Amanda explained to me that my first payment didn't come out until April oh I said okay thinking to myself I  know I have been making payments for longer and than she told me that I had to pay for an additional two months as part of a thirty day cancelation fee....WOW so much for the you can cancel after five months B.S. I was told twice once when I signed up and again when I spoke with Amy a few months later.... I than said thank you and hung up. I wanted to make sure before I said anything that I had been making payments longer and sure enough like I said in the beginning after going through my bank records  I had made  my first monthly payment along with a membership fee in March. I had called back to sort it out and another assiociate named Danielle answered I asked her If they had any any record of my March payment and she had said yes for your membership fee and your $59.00 monthly payment oh good I said because i was told that my last payment was suppose to be in August not in July and that would have me paying for a total of six months not five right.... Danielle' s response was ughhhhhhhhh...hold on I will get the assistant manager. At this point I was done and handed the phone to my husband to talk to her, Amanda told my husband that my first monthly payment in March didn't count.... toward my payments of five months, even though it was 83.00 because of my member ship fee was added to it that April was the first months of payments because my March payment was for unlimited membership.... um yes I know I paid a unlimited membership fee of 24.00 AND a monthly payment of 59.00 So why wouldn't that count as part of the five months???? Oh I get it another SCAM in their contract just like when they tell you that you can cancel in five months as long as you give a thirty day notice so I guess in March my membership fee and monthly payment I gave them was jus for nothing...what a complete SCAM. I work in a very busy hospital in the surgery department and will be WARNING everyone staff and patients to stay away from this SHADY business. And further more what kind of manager lets their employers give potential customers the idea that they can cancel in five months this company's employees should be honest and tell customers you are paying for a total of eight months but only signing up for five months of use. Disgusted!",0
"Did not have a good experience with this company.  Came into my home and was unprofessional by talking smack about another electrician while on the job.  May not have noticed that I was listening but nonetheless, should keep that type of chatter to themselves.  In addition, the work was not done appropriately and I had to call another electrician in.  I would instead recommend Anthem Electric.",0

"Only giving one star because zero wasn't an option.  We were 2 miles from the store took over half an hour for it to be delivered. The delivery driver didn't have anything marking his car as delivery, as we were staying in a hotel this would have been helpful. Got our pizza and the order was wrong, they forgot to put the pepperoni and sausage on the pizza. The lady I spoke to was rude.",0

Smallest amount of meat I have ever seen in a taco from Taco Bell or anywhere really it was less that 1 bite of meat but he told me this is standard across the country.,0
"For the price you're paying, the food is VERY low quality. Not even comparable to a Panda Express, in the worst way. The brown rice had 0 flavor, almost tasted like you're chewing on plastic. It was a 3 out of 10 experience and a 0 out of 10 food experience. Very disappointed.",0
"STAY AWAY - TERRIBLE SERVICE - AS FOR FOOD, THERE ARE MUCH BETTER OPTIONS ON ST. CLAIR!!!!Went to every Eurocup game here, expect the final because the owner's son said they were not making reservations when I made it (3 days before); funny because I filled out a form and handed it to the waitress. The guy said, well it's not the restaurants fault, it was the waitress' for taking your reservation.When I got to the restaurant they basically said, good luck finding a table somewhere else and the owner's son walked away. They are very unprofessional.This was my local option for games and what not, because drinks are drinks, however not anymore.The food, was not very good either.-Calamari was overcooked and tasted like old oil-Pizza is kind of dry and flavourless-Caesar Salad dress was made with sugar, it is really weird when you first taste the dressing and it's sweetIf you want crappy service and equally as crappy food, have a good time.",0
"If you'd like to be treated like trash this is the place to go! Worst experience in dining . We were excited to try this restaurant since we'd heard great things about it but I will make sure everyone knows what lack of customer service is provided here! I originally reserved a table days before to ensure our seats. Unfortunately they didn't listen to me when I told them the amount of people. When we arrived and they realized it was a smaller party they hurried us out of the original table we were seated at to move us to another. The way they rushed us like cattle was upsetting. The server was abrupt and lacked of personality from the moment he asked what we wanted to drink he acted as if we were a bother to him. The server and the owner treated us as if they thought they were better than us.This is not fine dining! This is a local business so act like it! Treat people as you'd like to be treated. Las Vegas is known for customer service and this restaurant sure missed the mark. As I was leaving I told one of the employees that I would be speaking to upper management and he laughed at me and let me know he was the owner. He sure didn't act like an owner, an owner would be sincere and apologetic and would try to improve the situation not antagonize the guest. The only apology we got was from the hostess who mistakenly reserved for a larger party. It's too bad we didn't get to try the food here but I won't be coming back here or recommending this place. I'm disgusted with the way my family and I were treated.",0

He said ""I recommend seeing an oral surgeon, I'll give you a number to schedule an appointment."" Um hello, that's what I called and scheduled for to get done today! I am pissed I just missed a day of work, to sit in there for over two hours, to not even get seen and told go see someone else because we close soon. The receptionist gave me the phone numbers and prescription for pain and I just left them on the counter.Save your money for a more professional doctor and especially save your time!",0
"This place is run by someone that clearly does not care about customers or animals.  Purchased two Egg Laying Hens and received two Egg Laying Hens and hundreds of Mites!!  I am now forced to treat my entire flock with some powered stuff because it's highly contagious and easily transferable to the other ladies we have.  The Hens were sold without being checked by staff.  They arrived via sketchy pickup truck in the alley then placed in a cage and handed to us by staff.  The people dropping off the Hens in the pickup truck were wearing Nacho Libre masks.  Let it be noted, the masks were super cool, however, the Mites on the Hens were not. Thanks for the diseased chickens and extra expenses!  Never ever again will I shop at Pratt's Glendale!!!

"This is probably my worst experience hotel stay ever. We booked non-smoking rooms; instead they gave us an upgraded with smoking rooms. Bad services and bad business trade. Why would we want an upgraded Front desk ladies gave us an attitude when we politely asked for connecting rooms. We wouldn't recommend families or friends to stay at this hotel. Customer services rated worst, rooms are dirty and smelly.",0
The older lady who does the cash register is horrible! Every time I come here she says my address out loud! Every time I say please don't do that. This time I asked her not to say my address or loud ahead of time; and she still did. She is a passive aggressive crazy person. I left my merchandise on the counter and walked out.

"I tried grub hub instead of yelp, the delivery was late, cold, and terrible quality.  When I received the order it was a spilled oiley mess in the bag and COLD.  I was so hungry I ate it anyways.  When I got home tonight to heat up the rest of the saucy rice, I discovered that there was no more shrimp in my Kung Pao order of 13$; so I called the restaurant and since the manager wasn't in, I got screamed at in Chinese, and told to ""too rate for probrems"".  The quality of the kung pao was all carrots and zucchini, and a lot of Rice, I will NEVER order from them again,  I even tried to talk to them about why the food was so poor quality and was told ""too rate for probrems"" .... try China One (which is my usual go to chinese) or any other these guys don't care, and don't want to hear any ""probrems"".  I'm usually not too picky, but these guys just want your money and the delivery fee.... they don't care about my ""probrems"".

"The only Mexican restaurant at York University so they just have an ""screw you, pay me!"" attitude. After so many bad experiences I just refuse to go to this place. I love Burrito Boyz, Burrito Banditos, and Chipotle, etc., but I will never ever ever go to Z-teca.  The staff are either surly or just don't care.  The thing that drives me into a blind rage is that they ask you what toppings you would like but they only let you choose a preset number, so if you want corn, and salsa and peppers, NO SORRY YOU CAN ONLY HAVE TWO. One time I asked for no cheese, but then I wanted 3 veggies, they said no sorry you only get two. I'm like WTF I said no cheese and cheese costs you way more than some god damn 5 cents worth of corn.   I literally had to ask to speak to the manager before they would give me the forbidden kernels of their precious corn.  Go f yourselves you cheap mofos. NO other Mexican restaurant does this. If you go to chipotle and ask them for everything they will give you everything (except guac which is extra) If you ask chipoltle for extra beans or corn or veggies they will do pile that bad boy till it's sky high.  I can understand if its quac or cheese or meat and you want extra, yes you have to pay more, but I'm talking about CORN.   Corngate 2017 - NEVER FORGET!",0
"Just got a comment from Rob W. who works for Picasso ' s I guess? I usually don't care enough to respond but for some reason his comments struck a cord for me.     Rob, ""explaining"" to any customer about an inconvenience regarding a poor experience is pointless and comes across as if you lack any compassion. Guest perception is reality in this business as I'm sure you know. I don't like to plug the fact that I am in the restaurant business because who cares, but I feel the need to share with you my side of things.     In regards to the fire hazards in your restaurant you should stand proud in your staff being diligent about compliance.  However,  let's not embelish, the main side of your patio was over crowded with a large party which was far more hazardous than the 8 foot wide space to walk past our table once we were seated at the converted 2 top. Also by no means we're we in any way compromising safety of our family or anyone else in the restaurant. Remember it's 74 degrees outside and 6 o'clock on a Friday in April in Scottsdale, if you have the space available accommodate your guests. Don't excuse your oversight with a fire regulation it comes across a bit insulting.    In regards to the crayon policy no big deal there , it was just wierd and awkward to be given crayons to my 3 year old daughter which is a nice touch but then have them taken away. Once again it was 74 degrees outside and the sun was setting I'm certain there wasn't going to be an issue with melting. It's not my place and I really don't care about the crayons but because we were put off by the situation maybe you could educate your staff on when it might be appropriate to offer crayons on the patio. Take into consideration of outdoor temperature and follow through with proper cleaning after the guests leave you might be able to avoid the melted crayon problems.  Really though I dont care about the crayons it was just an uncomfortable experience for us.     Lastly Rob, owning your mistakes and learning from them are some of the most valuable lessons we have in this business.  I urge you to avoid standing behind arbitrary rules and instead treat situations with a little more common sense. Take note that your restaurant's food that night was subpar (which we didnt even get all the food we ordered) and should be addressed. No one ever in that moment acted as if they cared, and we left hungry and terrribly unsatisfied.    Again I'm not sure why I'm going at lengths to share this with you. Maybe it's because I love hospitality. Anyway I'm done with picassos but I maybe i can leave you with sime advice. Allow the customer to be comfortable,  be hospitable and genuine,  serve good food that you have tasted and when you make a mistake own it. Empathy goes a long way in this business.  I hope this comment serves you well.Good luck...",0
"Mike the manager should be fired! Zero customer service and 100% lack of intelligence. I ordered a house salad, and when I picked it up i was being charged for a $15 salad that had oranges and walnuts and who knows what else..and when I mentioned it to him that it was not what I ordered, his response was ""just take the stuff you don't like out"" once again I said, ""why am I being charged for a more expensive salad that I did NOT ORDER? I ordered a house salad!""  He once again suggested I take everything I don't like out, but that id still have to pay the price of the more expensive salad because it's what they do! After insisting for 10min, that he had my order wrong, he went to the back and brought back another salad, and said it was the house salad, when I checked, I saw walnuts...it looked like he poked through my salad and just took crap out. I was soon frustrated that I just wanted to get out and pay.  Now paying was another ordeal! I was also picking up an order for my coworker. When I called and placed the order I had made it very clear that it was to be separate checks...well not with mike at the register!  He suggested that my coworker pay the full bill on her card, because he didn't want to split the check!  That was another 10min of dealing with this idiot!  I mean I have never had such an experience with a more basic individual...Flo's I hope you can do a better job at hiring your managers. This guy didn't even understand basic customer service...sad part is that not once did he try remedy the situation...he was just straight out lazy and disrespectful! I feel bad for the girl in training standing next to him...as a manager you have to lead by example...sad to say this was not the case!",0
"We've ordered from this place for years and the food and service has generally been fine. That's no longer the case and our to-go order tonight was the last straw. To start, we asked the cashier to please check that our order was correct. He did not do so and immediately said it was correct. We checked it and sure enough, it was not all there. His response was ""I just got here"". When we asked him if he thought that excused an incorrect order he said we were ""being rude"". The food itself was terrible as well. Sushi rolls fell apart and tasted days old. The teriyaki chicken was like jerky and was more breading than chicken. Two of the three of us threw our food away and agreed to never eat here again.",0
"Rats and flooding in unit, doesn't get worse than that, except it's also expensive. Redeeming quality is Fred the Manager is a genuine and professional guy, wish he would have a mandate to fix what appear to be systemic problems at the Griffintown facility.",0
"Only go if you personally know the seating host. When I go to this restaurant I know it gets busy and I am prepared to wait. Yesterday however, the seating host blatantly let in several groups that showed up after we did. So after our meal I tried to explain what happened to the manager and before I could finish he gave me a prefab, canned explaination. I tried several times to make my point but the manager would not allow me to finish. I found this to be extremely rude and I'm afraid that I will not return to this restaurant. Other than that, the food was only mediocre, prices have gone up, the wait staff was at least pleasant.",0
"After reading all the raves about how good this place was I decided to try it. This place is the epitome of American style Thai food. Why ?Well , for starters, the chicken satay is dark meat and fried. Need I say more ? In fact , I think it was twice fried because it was like eating leather.I've had satay in about 20 different places....always grilled white meat. I could go on and rip this place to hell, but why bother ?With a name like Archi's no doubt Jughead is running this place....",0
"There should be a No star option on yelp. HORRIBLE melon head location in Aurora. Lilly, was my sons hair stylist. (That name was on the receipt). He didn't want to sit on the vehicles and instead wanted to sit on my lap. First huff sound from Lilly .  She started to work on him and his hair was falling and sticking to mine and my sons clothes.  I asked  for a cape, and another puff and huff from her. He started to cry and cry as she cut . I asked for a break, a huff!!!  I then commented that she isn't friendly like other melon heads in markham that we goto. She seemed so annoyed by the break and sobbing that I told her to just finish up. And then hair started to get into his mouth and he was trying to grab them out, and she continues!!! Asking me to hold his hands down. I asked her to stop!Looking around at the other staff, they also didn't look so friendly so I didn't ask them to take over. She was about to charge me full price! I had to remind her that April is $15 at her location. As I was putting on my son jacket, I heard her then charge the next person full price. So they aren't honest either. This lady should not be working with children. She was cold hearted and not thinking of the child's feelings. I've never left service without leaving a tip and this behaviour didn't deserve a penny. We left  with a bad impression of melonheads. I hope this experience doesn't affect our next hair cut!!",0
"My friend and I went to this park as we needed to escape the Las Vegas heat. They have some good slides and a great lazy river but they have many problems they need to work out. The first would be to train their staff in how to treat customers. One of the rides doesn't allow single riders. The sign says there is a 600 pound weight limit. Now, me and my friend are both sizable guys and don't pretend we aren't but we clock in well under 600 combined. The very friendly girl handing out the tubes told us she thought we were good on the weight limit. A snotty lifeguard jumped in and said we were too big. Apparently the tubes that support up to 600 pounds aren't in yet (just one of the problems they need to fix). Neither of us was rude or argumentative. In fact we thought we were treated quite politely. As we walked away the snotty lifeguard said ""You guys could always lose some weight."" I moved here from Arkansas. The park in Little Rock trains its employees to treat every guest as a ""10"". Now we aren't tens figure wise and know we arent, but its not right for a park employee to treat guests with such disrespect. I won't be back.",0
Flies EVERYWHERE! Great food but it's ruined the instant you get it because there are flies CONSTANTLY landing on your food. They have a serious fly problem. My advice is get it to go because the food is worth it.,0
"This used to be my favorite place. I came here during the soft opening when it first opened up and have been a loyal customer. But the last two times here have been a complete disaster!!My cousin and I waited about 20 min even though we already had a reservation, eh, no problem. We sat down and had the first round of meats then we didn't see anyone for 15 min, I mean NO ONE, not our waiter or any carvers! Our waiter came by and I told him the issue a few minutes later 2 carvers stopped by then nothing again for 15 min and this was a slow day according to our waiter and 2 carvers. The waiter apologized and mentioned it to the manager which I believe is the GM cause I remember him when it first opened up. I asked to speak to the manager since I had to wave down carvers and the manger didn't come to talk to me. The waiter apologized again and pointed him out to me to talk to him on the way out. We had the VIP card which is always returned to us by a manager once they stamp it and come thank you for being a regular VIP customer, again he avoided us and had the waiter bring us the card back. To top it off he has the nerve to look me in the eye and walk away into the kitchen area when he saw us walk toward him. I waited a few minutes and just left.The food is good if you actually have carvers who know what you like and make sure they visit the table regularly but the service has been horrible!!!! I cancelled having a birthday dinner there for this disrespect!",0
"I would give a negative star if it was available.  The whole experience was terrible.  It started with a receptionist that didn't know the business so she didn't ask the right questions.  I had to give her all the details.  The day of the appointment, the tech showed up 30 minutes late then had to wait for the owner to show up an hour later to give a price quote.  This job was obviously more than a one man job but the owner did not seem to want to help his employee to get the job done.  They did not clean up after the work, leaving dirt and particles from the duct system on the floor.  I had to ask the employee to put the vents back in place and they still missed one. My recommendation, check out other businesses.",0
"OK this place gets one star because of their cleanliness levels. If you ask me if the food is good, I would say yes, the food is amazing but the lack of cleanliness at this place makes the good food taste bad. I walked into their men's room and almost threw up. For the folks running this place, please put some money into cleaning up the place, it will reap good rewards in the near future as you do have some decent food.",0
"Last week caught me travelling for longer than I expected. I was running low on contacts, and shipping another box from home was not an option. Luckily, I was staying near the Camelback Colonnade LensCrafters. I figured they would have access to my prescription, which was written at a LensCrafters in California. Even if the lenses were out of stock, I could afford to wait while they shipped in.When I called, I was told my LensCrafters in California would have to fax in my prescription. Inconvenient - my prescription is available at LensCrafters.com - but not the end of the world. I comply.Forty minutes later I received a call from Miriam at the Camelback Colonnade LensCrafters. She informs me that they did not have my lenses in stock. I ask if she could check whether other LensCrafters in the area had the lenses in stock. She tells me I should call them myself. Then she hung up. I am not sure if she was being rude or negligent. Either way, nobody deserves this kind of lack of professionalism.",0
"What a dump!  Just got back from a weekend at the Orleans and it was awful.  The casino, hallways and elevators were dirty.  The restaurants inside the hotel were awful, poor quality food and horrible service.  Our room overlooked the parking structure and was a ""premium"" room which was supposed to have been recently renovated.  What a joke, the room was large however it was dated and the bathroom door, which was a pocket door, was broken.  It would not shut all the way or lock.  If you like a comforter on your bed, forget about it at this hotel, you get two sheets and a thin blanket. What little security we saw had their hands full the whole time we were there, people laying in the hallways, room hopping, inebriated individuals that couldn't find their room and oh happened to be in their underwear.if all that isn't enough let me say this part of town is really bad.  I would not feel comfortable walking anywhere.  Never again will we stay at this hotel.  Just AWFUL!",0
Ordered a pizza online to be delivered to a friend who just had a baby. He put $0 as a tip because it wasn't him paying for it and they put a 1 in front of the 0 giving themselves a $10 tip. I called and told them about it and have yet to hear back.,0
"Absolutely the worst place in the Charlotte Airport. Common food, and honestly the most obnoxious and slow servers in the entire complex. Avoid at all costs. The mexican place at the end of the B concourse is far better",0
"So, I booked a room with two queen beds for three nights through Hotels.com, we arrived at the hotel at 1 am dead tired. The first clerk at the front desk said They can not honor what they promised and they can give us a room with King bed and said if we have a problem we should contact hotels.com at 1 am!  I explained to them that we need two queen beds and at 1 am hotels.com is not reachable, and they insisted that they can not honor. I asked for a manager and he offered us a complementary rollover bed instead of two queen beds, when I asked please refund us so we can go somewhere else he said no, and he was pretty rude in his attitude in front of my guests.  He could offer us an upgrade since they could not honor their reservation and also he had an option to refund us and he did not do anything instead gave us a rude attitude at 2 am(by now we were at the checkin lobby for an hour ) in the morning when we could barely walk. At the end the second manager came and I asked again that we can not go to a room with a King bed and a rollover bed and asked at least to refund us to go to another hotel and this time he agreed to refund us and he was pretty polite. If I were those management I would have never rejected some tired tourists who drove 6 hours and arrived at midnight after a long wait and argument with them. I do not believe that such a big hotel did not have a single bedroom that has two queen beds availible . Until now all I remembered from Bellagio was its beautiful Conservatory and unique fountains but after this experience , I just wish those people in management put as much work and art in their service as people who built this hotel in such a unique architecture. We finally went to Venetian at 3 am and had a fantastic experience there.",0
"I bought a Groupon for this place, but was charged $8 because apparently the Groupon didn't come with color The girl hardly talked to me, walked me back to the room and told me to go in. That's the only direction she gave me. I wasn't directed on how to stand, what to do, or what to expect. Because of this, I stood wrong and my tan turned out AWFUL. The girl didn't tell me how long to wait to shower or anything when I got out. She didn't even look up to say goodbye. WORST SERVICE. WORST TAN. DO NOT GO HERE.",0
"I was looking for a salon in my neck of the woods and decided to try True Essence. I assumed it was going to be a higher end salon since it is an Aveda salon in a good area of Mesa. I was very disappointed. While consulting, I told my stylist how much I wanted off and she asked about layers. I said yes, she said well lets see how it goes as she starts cutting. I opted for a blow out as well...she spent like 5 min. cutting the length and went on to blowing it out. I assumed she would go back in to texturize or something but nope, she took my cape off. No mirror and turn to show me the cut, no opportunity to say anything. She was DONE. I dont like feeling like I have to get confrontational for service so I opted to just leave. Well, I paid $50 for basically a cut I could have gotten from Super Cuts or an untrained friend...just cutting the length. No layers, she told me the layers I had already worked, um, I dont see layers,they are all grown out and now right where my length ends. .No face framing. Nothing. I think she just BS'd me. On my way home, I felt my hair and it was still damp and once I got home I looked in the mirror and underneath my hair I had tons of waves. So not only was my cut the most basic and underwhelming cut I've ever had, she didn't even give me a good blow out. All for $50. I just find it to be a huge put off to be rushed over like that and not even do a good job at the simplest of cuts. I will never go back. Now I need to look for another salon. My stylist was Kayla and my apnt was early afternoon.",0

"So far... it has taken them 2 days to get a prescription ""signed off"" by a doctor and sent over to a pharmacy. Mind you, it still has not been sent to the pharmacy yet. Multiple phone calls later, and still nothing is done. They can't seem to do anything correctly to ease the patient's situation. Every time we called, they kept saying that they are ""trying"" to get it signed off by the doctor. And when we asked where the doctor is... she says ""she's in the office"" and kept giving excuses as to why it takes 2 days to electronically send a prescription over to a pharmacy! The level of incompetence here is unbelievable and absolutely unprofessional.",0
"This place is a joke. My wife and I moved in in August 2014 when it was formerly called Broadstone Element and the office staff was at least helpful at that time, now that there is a new management company running the complex everything has gone down hill. None of the leasing people are the same when you go into the office, you can go in on a Monday and the following Monday that person is no longer working there. They always have temporary staff working who know nothing about the complex and are of no help. Management does not call you back when you call and leave a voicemail to talk to a manager. The manager is also the only person with the code to access the voicemails so if you leave a voicemail and the manager is gone then you will never get a phone call back. They have excuses for everything so don't expect for them to actually take any responsibility. They advertise on the website that the complex has gated access, try gates that never work and on top of that they have removed the stands that you enter the code into to open the gate so they will not be fixing the gates anytime soon. Btw, that is also false advertising. Pools are joke, they are never clean and the hot tubs are never hot and the jets don't work either. The lease also states that we are not allowed to abandon vehicles and yet there was a car parked outside my apartment building for 6 months that never moved, told the office about it and they said that if the towing company did not report it they could not do anything about. Another example of the staff refusing to do their job. The rec room is a joke, they used to have video game systems in there but they have been removed and I'm pretty sure the pool table is no longer functional as there were no pool sticks or balls to use. The gym is probably the only place on the entire property that is halfway decent and that seems to be going down hill as equipment is disappearing. I will not be renewing my lease now that this new management company has taken over. If I could afford to move out now, I would.5/12/2015 - providing an update to my previous review. Took a picture today of the leasing offices golf carts parked in the handicap parking spot in front of the leasing office. Pretty sure that is a violation to the ADA.6/19/2016 - Final update for this horrible complex. Last weekend I went to the leasing office to ask what the renewal price would be if we stayed, we wanted a competive price. The leasing person told me that the renewal offer would come during the week and it would come to the apartment when they go it. The week went by we received no renewal offer by the apartment complex so yesterday I went to the office and signed our 60 day move out notice.If you want to live at a halfway decent apartment complex with extremely sub par management this is the apartment complex for you.",0
"Don't ever go here!!!!!! Dirty and unprofessional! I went there with a dealfind coupon and after waiting about 45 min she tells me that they are too busy to provide both services for me (one hour massage and one hour facial) even though I had an appointment. Stupidly, I agree to have a facial. She brings me into this tiny dirty back room and starts my facial. During it, she must have left me alone at least 5 times while she provided services to other clients- never telling me where she was going. The entire facial only lasted 40 min with no extractions and I was left lying there by myself for more half of it.Then she told me that I could receive 30 min of my massage but would have to come back for the remaining 30 min at a later date. So another lady comes in and starts lightly rubbing my back and putting absolutely zero effort in it. After about 15 min, Sonia pokes her head in and says that now I can receive my entire one hour massage. At this point the massage was so horrible that I really didn't care. However, when it was done I looked at my watch and saw that it had only been 35min!Lastly, the washroom was disgusting! There was urine all over the toilet seat.Don't make the mistake of going here. She overbooks and then doesn't provide the full service that people paid for. I saw many people who came in and were told that they couldn't get their full treatment. She has at least 3 clients at a time.",0
I'm positive the ramen here is made with sewer water. It smells and taste like it was made in a toilet. I took a bite and had to fake an emergency  to get out of there. Unfortunately due to the excitement and kindness of the host I paid $12 (regrettable) and got a to go box to not offend. I then swiftly threw it in the trash two stores down. I would have given it to a homeless person but didn't want them to die of dysentery.,0
"This hotel and casino has the largest sportsbook in Vegas but other than that I wasn't impressed. Just look like a ran down casino, therefore we wouldn't even check out the rooms. The staffs at the sportsbook were super rude. So I took my money to the mgm grand.",0
"I truly wish I didn't have to rate a 1 star as I do not believe this establishment deserves a 1 star however Yelp makes me rate something to move forward with this review. I hadn't ever been into Cost Plus and my first experience was this store on 54th Street in Chandler when my husband and I were shopping for a new dining room table and some other furniture. 1st visit and for the sake of not writing a book I'll provide straight facts. We found a table and chairs we liked so we asked the floor sales rep for some help. She stated the stockroom was very full as they just got a delivery in but that she'd leave a note for the night crew to pull it and we could come pick it up the following day. She was very nice, very helpful. Night 2. We went back and decided on a different table and so we asked for assistance. The sales floor rep told us once again that their back room was very full since they just received a shipment and even if it wasn't his job to pull furniture (as he says this he plops down to sit in the chair at the table we picked out). I asked to speak with the manager on duty so the rep went and found her and said loud enough for me to purposely hear ""this lady wants to speak with you so she can complain"". I said to him ""actually I didn't say I wanted to complain"". In speaking with her, she too confirmed the stockroom was too full and we'd have to come back. I explained that we were told that very same thing the night before and asked how does their corporate offices expect them to sell merchandise if they can't get it out of the stockroom. She had no interest in trying to assist. I asked them to locate the furniture at another store and we inconveniently drove to Tempe Marketplace to purchase the furniture (approximately $900 worth). Thankfully, that store offered up much better customer service. I have to tell you, I was contacted by a regional manager after I had called their 800 number to voice my experience. She apologized and stated the issue would be addressed. She left a $25 gift card at the store for me to give them another chance. It was a nice gesture.SO, I go to use my $25 gift card to give them another chance and purchase some more furniture. I purchased a $350 cabinet and a $300 lamp/lamp shade. I went to put in my credit card online and the website kicked me out stating that one of the pieces was ""out of stock"" at the store to do a buy online and pick up in store. So I entered my order again, paid, and had no option but to pay the delivery fee for furniture. Guess what? The first order showed up on my credit card! It went through, even though it didn't let me complete my purchase!! I called the local store and they confirmed the order did indeed go through. I promise you, I didn't get a confirmation stating it went through, it kicked me out and brought me back to the main landing page of the site. I called the 800 number to cancel the online order because it is less expensive to pick up in the store right? Well, the CSR told me, they were closing in 10 minutes and she couldn't help because the order hadn't come through on their end. I asked for a supervisor to see if there was anything that could be done to cancel the order. She put me on hold for about 10 minutes and came back and said there was no supervisor in the building. A call center w/o a supervisor? OK. So, I had to call the local store, pay more for shipping and wait for the furniture to arrive because there was ""nothing they could do"". Or was it that they ""wanted to do?""2 really bad customer service experiences I'm going to have to say, I'm not a fan. It's incomprehensible to me how they stay in business. Their prices are very over the top and their customer service is really bad.",0
"buyer beware!!!!!! do not go here. They advertise 4 sessions for $49 but girls at front desk don't tell you that you automatically charged for 2 months even if you can cancel right away.

"One word...AWFUL!  If I could leave a 0, I would.  We decided to come for a birthday after seeing a movie at AMC.  When we entered, there was a sign saying to seat ourselves. So we proceeded to do so and some lady (who seemed to have been eating, and accompanied by another gentleman, who was possibly the owners) jumped off the bar stool and got us some menus.  The restaurant was pretty small, empty, and extremely hot.  Our server was very nice but so quiet we could barely hear anything he was saying.  We ordered the salmon, fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp, linguini with clams and chicken piccata with angel hair,and I also asked to add some mushrooms to this dish.  When I asked the server if there was any mushrooms in the picatta dish, he said he didn't know but would ask, and if there weren't any, he would add it and it would cost $2.  I said ok.  Then he comes back and says it's actually $3.   Bread was served at table which was very cold and some pieces were soggy because they were wet.  My daughter said her salmon was great, but all other pasta dishes were horrible.  Especially the piccata and clam pasta.  First off, the clams were supposed to be served with linguini pasta but was served with spaghetti, and there was no flavor at all.  Extremely bland.  My chicken piccata was served with linguini, but was supposed to come with angel hair pasta.  When I bought it to the servers attention, he asked me, is it not angel hair?  And said he didn't know if it was or not but he would get me a side.  If you're going to work in an Italian restaurant, shouldn't you at least know the different pasta types that you serve?!  Anyway, the chicken was actually served with a marsala sauce and not caper lemon sauce, and I was pretty much done with my chicken when the angel hair came out, so when the server bought the pasta out he asked me if I wanted to just box it all up since I was almost done.  I did not finish any of the pasta.  I pretty much ate just the chicken.  I would not recommend this place to anyone because it's too expensive for the quality, portion, and service.  Through all of this, if the owners were the 2 sitting at the bar, you should evaluate everything in your restaurant and yourselves.  It was so empty that night in the restaurant and you clearly were not busy,  but not once did you come over to see how everything was.",0

"Came here on Thanksgiving Monday. the two nearby shwarma places were closed because of the holiday. Which is what I'm going to say accounted for the super long line up. It couldn't possibly have been because of the food. Or the employees/service.I walked in and there was at least 5-8 people ahead of me. I mentally prepared for slow service. Before I even got to order, I saw several people be told that what they wanted (whole chicken, falefals, potatoes, etc) was not available today/anymore. This place is generally open until 2am... before 7pm they have run out of several items or simply did not have them at all that day.Literally before I go to order, the man who was making all the shwarma sandwiches/servicing the dinner entrees throws a fit. Facing the customers, he starts yelling to the kitchen staff. I'm still not sure what happened, but it seems people were not sure what their tasks were. He yelled something along the lines of if you want me to be in the kitchen, get out of the kitchen/if you're in the kitchen, stay in the kitchen. So he storms off, throwing things about. Eventually he goes into the kitchen and some other dude comes to make the sandwiches I'm ordering.He barely listens to what I say (I have four sandwiches and not everyone wants everything). He sloppily wraps the sandwiches. I pay, grab the food, and leave.It's about 5 min drive to my place and as my family eats their sandwiches, we, despite our hunger, decide never to return. It doesn't even taste that good. It's definitely not worth a second chance after the first experience. The worst part of the dismal service is that not a single customer was complaining about the lack of food or the wait or the tantrum. If you're going to be slow, at least make the food properly!",0
"ZERO Stars!!! Couldn't be professional even if they tried. I applied for a security supervisor position and was scheduled for an interview. I arrived early to the interview and was told that the person conducting the interview had left for the day. Yikes! Couldn't believe that the recruiter would be so inconsiderate as to not notify me and reschedule?! Thanks for wasting the time and fuel of someone who was out of work at the time. Speaks volumes of the organization. Guess I dodged a bullet there.My advice: Pay attention to the cultural norms in a professional environment, and follow them. If you watch how others in a professional office operate, you'll learn all sorts of important things about ""how we do things here."" For instance, you might observe that everyone shows up precisely on time for meetings, that they modulate their voices when others are on the phone, and that people rely on email for non-urgent questions. Most importantly - observe and take notes on how people in a professional setting time manage and coordinate with appointments (canceling/rescheduling). These are important signals for what will be expected of your own behavior - and you'll come across as tone-deaf if you ignore them.",0
"Went in looking for some new bed linens, went downstairs to look and was virtually IGNORED by the staff. I counted no less than 8 staff members who practically tripped over each other to avoid helping myself and the other people that were there. I walked right up to an associate and asked about a comforter they had advertised on the website and she walked away from me without saying a word. Called the store after I left to speak to someone in charge and was passed off to three different people who all claimed it wasn't their department and one of the women I talked to had the audacity to change her voice and pretend she was someone else. You wonder why the store looks like a ghost town. This is why.",0
"Do not go there. Horrible, horrible, horrible.I have never written a bad review before but this one was a must.We went to Yang yang's for my birthday because another restaurant we wanted to go to did not take reservations and the line was very long, so we picked Yang's since it was close by.We regret coming to Yang Yang's because the food was not fresh and the service was horrible. The server had given us the wrong dish many times but she never apologized and had an attitude. For example: I had ordered an avocado and salmon handroll and the server gave me an avocado handroll without the salmon. So I requested a new one to be made but she said: ""I can give you a piece of salmon sushimi and you can take a bite of the sushimi and a bite of the hand roll or roll it yourself"". We tried to be very nice and patient with her since we did not want to ruin our mood. I told her that I would very much appreciate it if she could ask the chef to make me a new one as that was my original order. After a few minutes the server same back with the old avacodo handroll and a piece of the sushimi on the side when I had made it clear I do not what it that way. Although it was her mistake, she did not apologize nor did she try to amend her mistake. We feel like we were robbed for having to pay $28-30 for the service and food that was provided. We will never go back to Yang Yang's again. If I can give anything lower than a 1 star I would.",0

This was my first time here and my last. The young woman who does the pedicures hurt the crap out of my toe. She had no customer service skills at all. The water was too hot she didn't ask if it was ok. She ditched me to work on someone else. I never got a top coat and I had to ask if I was good to go after waiting 25 minutes. She didn't check if my polish was dry. She didn't help me put my flip flops on. She didn't even take the paper separating my toes off my feet. She must not work for the tips. I normally tip 25% but you young lady got 10% and that was even too much. Find a different spot!,0

Six times my lease agreement changed and all 6 times they could not calculate the payment owed.  Seriously isn't this one of the biggest parts of your job as a leasing agent or manager?  In the 5 years I have lived here, grounds keeping has declined significantly, there is no longer any recycling options (this is 2017 right?!?), the office won't take packages over the size of a shoebox, and the office is now closed on Sundays.  Yet, of course rent goes up each year.There is shockingly little correspondence when policies change or at lease renewal time yet they are very good at notifying of taco truck night, ""community building"" events and when you have done something non-compliant.  Oh and the BED BUGS that the office admitted COULD have come from a maintenance work order were fully blamed on me (even without proof) and therefore were my financial responsibility to treat.  Desert Horizon is getting 1 star because I am unable to give them ZERO.",0
"Ahh sushi.. I've been to so many places that I liked yet so many that I've hated. This ones kindof the latter. I normally judge the restaurant by the smell first before eating, thank god I ordered take out because this place smelled awful.I ordered the green dragon, a special house one, California and got dumplings( I thought they were veggie..) Dumplings were just really bad. All the rolls tasted old, soft and had a weird fish smell( I would understand if I ordered anything with fish but I didn't) The rolls also weren't wrapped properly, falling apart before I even ate it. The only good thing that came from this was my tempura lol",0
"They have stone crab in the name of the restaurant.  They sell stone crab and charge you a lot of $ since they market the stone crabs as 'fresh'.  Anybody who knows what a good, fresh crab is suppose to be will know that they are sweet.  These expensive crabs are not fresh or not sweet.",0
"Went for early dinner on SUNDAY.Servers were friendly but the food was not very tasty. The Fettuccini Alfredo was bland and overcooked ,sitting in a watery white sauce.The salmon dish was such a disappointment we sent it back. The penne in a marinara sauce was mediocre at best.  The highlight of the meal was the bread which was served upon arrival. This was our first visit to East Side Marios and will most likely be our last.",0
"loud,  soulless, but worst of all they pump perfume into the air that irritates my (and my friends') eyes and lungs...   it's not from the cigarette smoke,  we've all been exposed to that having been over 21 before smoking in bars ended.    the perfume is horrible.. seriously fuck lone butte!  never returning in a million lifetimes.",0
"I used to love my car, but now when I drive him I just think of this place.  Their motto seems to be pay a lot and get crummy work.  They are rude and ignorant.  If you question anything they do their response is ""we didnt break your car, you did""  Really? What kind of response is this?  Hey doctor can you explain why I am sick?  Doctor: Dont ask me, I didnt get you sick, you did.  And both the guys I talked to used this response, they must train them to say this since they get so many complaints.  So if your car needs work, you can bring it to them if you want to pay a lot and get terrible work.  Just make sure you understand that you broke your car, not them.",0
"The fall of brick and mortar retail stores. This is another one that will bite the dust because on-line shopping is much better. Why would any one want to fight traffic on Eastern Avenue or Silverado Ranch Blvd, park among cars flinging by, and then go inside to be annoyed and bothered by shoppers and bad selection?  This is the next Kmart, people. I literally get a headache at this place, and places just like it. Yet Target tries to sell themselves off as so modern and chic. No thanks. I can make up my own mind on who I want to be and what I want to buy. One very dimly lit star.",0
"This place has horrendous customer service.  I returned my item the day I received it.  The store received my package in the next few days (I paid for delivery confirmation) and then they sat on it for 2 weeks before they ""entered it"" into their system.  I called to see if they received it and they merely responded, ""Yeah, I see it but the girl who does returns isn't here."" Two weeks later, after they enter it into their system, you have to wait another 30 days for them to credit your card!  You would think with the advent of today's technology, they can credit your card in a few days like the rest of the world.  Is there a black hole that resides over this store?  So lame--I'm still waiting for my money back!",0
Flew with these guys from Seattle to Charlotte with my wife coming home from our wedding.  Since our wedding was out of the country we had to take all of our luggage through customs so we inspected it before we rechecked it to US Air as we had several suitcases tagged fragile with one of them being a hard case. They were fine from the previous 2 flights. When we pick up our bags in Charlotte the hard cases brand new lock is smashed and It reminded me immediately that I have never flown US Air and not gotten my bags torn and beat up. This hard case contained a framed picture of my wife and I mounted on a larger piece of design paper that our guests at our wedding could sign. Thankfully it didn't have a glass cover over it yet but the paper and frame were smashed around so hard that it was pushed through all of the mounting tabs which really upset my wife.  I was able to get it somewhat straight after taking it all apart but the lock and new hard case are another story.  I had a brand new high end snowboard case ripped up by these guys a few years ago. We took a total of 11 flights in 26 days for our wedding and honeymoon and in all those trips our luggage didn't sustain any wear like the last leg of our trip home thanks to US air/ American Airlines.,0
Apparently they have recently reopened ....First of all this is NOT a Thai restaurant. It is a lousy Chinese restaurant.  I ordered 3 dishes and all 3 were buried in a soupy brown sauce even the rice.  The people who are Chinese were nice but they need to remove the Thai name and learn to cook!  I lived in Thailand for 10 years ...,0
"Make sure you understand what a ""bottomless"" soda is before you order a soda. asked for a soda and he brought ""bottomless"" which for 2 ppl was $27! This place is such a rip off. Then told the waiter we wanted to dispute our tab and he said he'd send a manager over and then we went and ran the card. Not the sharpest tool in the shed! They need to train people to explain how policies and also in customer service. The manager Jamie was very nice and refunded some of the charges but my overall experience is not good. I will definitely stick to the smaller comedy clubs.",0
"I saw two different therapists here at different points of my life.  My first experience I got nothing out of but didn't know any better.  My therapist said she was leaving to take another job and I just stopped going to therapy because it seemed so pointless.  Later in life, I tried another therapist here.  It ended disastrously.  I was terminated by my therapist.  Extremely traumatic.  I first found out by calling the office reception and was told all my appointments were cancelled.  I was not allowed a final session with my therapist for closure.  The person who called me back when I said I wanted to discuss how my treatment had abruptly ended was cold and uncaring, and I got the sense was trying to manage or handle the situation in a way that would cover themselves legally but not with the intent of helping me in any way.  Now, thankfully, I am going to therapy at a different establishment and have found out what a professional therapeutic experience should be.",0
"Room absolutely stunk of cigarettes!! It's in the air and I am allergic. Transients, people without id's,  one was being out when I went to check in...was talked out of cancelling - that WAS a HUGE mistake. Bedspread picked and stained.  Curtain stained and burned. Blanket stained. Just don't stay here.",0
Tried to charge $400.00 for a $25.00 part. No thanks. Do your research and be sure to ask questions.,0
"I have been to this place once, and for many, once is enough to leave you wishing you can fight for a refund of your money. Had the seafood platter which looked liked a fried soggy mess that came from an easy bake oven of a four year old. They try to charge and arm and leg for something that I could get better from the frozen food aisle at Wal-Mart. I am not a ""foodie"" hater but, I also will not hesitate to share my experiences whether they be good or bad.. and in this case Rhythm Kitchen was waaaaaaay off beat.",0
This place has the worst service.  Called in a juice for pick up and gave them 15 minutes leadtime. Showed up and they had not even started the order.  This is the third time this has happened.,0
"I planned my sons 9th Birthday here!! He was so excited! we went to a birthday party there and the hostess was amazing and we loved it so I called the next day and booked ours!i called the store and asked if I could request the same hostess Maria but was told she worked at a different location normally but promised we'd have the same experience. Then when I went t get the printable invites I couldn't so I went in the store again and spoke with the store manager and she said there was no way she could get me invites even though that is part of the package, so she gave me a deck of Chuck E. Cheese cards and I made my own invites. Then on the day of I get there and imagine my surprise when Maria (the hostess I requested) was there, but she wasn't my hostess, Alana was. She was horrible, she was rude and pushy, she brought the dipping dots before the pizza then served the kids pizza , while they were still eating she moved my sons pizza and set the cake in front of him and starting doing happy birthday and multiple guests told her that my husband and I weren't there and she needed to wait and she shrugged her shoulders and continued , I ran over and didn't even get to put all the candles on the cake, then she didn't even ask my son which slice he wanted and after he finished his pizza he asked me for a piece of cake and was upset that none of the characters pieces were  left, and it was HIS birthday!!! Then she thru away my salad plate I paid for and didn't even use, as she didn't tell anyone when she brought the food and some people didn't get to eat, including myself and my husband who paid for the party!! Then I was a goodie bag short! She rushed us the whole time and was very unhelpful and nice, especially when my son did the ticket blaster that he was so excited for and she didn't explain it to him and he got Hardly any tickets and she didn't wait for anyone to do it! So I spoke to Maria at the end and asked why they wouldn't let me have her as a hostess, as she was amazing! She said that she was no longer allowed to do parties and was put on probation due to someone at the my friends party Saying she gave free stuff away. I know they were referring to me as I spoke to the store manager about her when I requested her and I did not say that she gave free stuff away I said that she went above and beyond for them!I'm very upset as to how we were treated and how my son was treated being is we spent a ton of money and my intention was to have my other child's birthday there in July but I won't be doing that now this is very disappointing!",0
"The customer service was absolutely terrible. I been to many places before and this place took the cake of being the worst costumer service I ever had (that's saying something). The manager doesn't even know how to use the cash register.  It took three people to know how to use a coupon. And on the coupon it said ""no purchases required"" and they still charged us for something in order to get the free ice cream, so we bought a drink. We complained about how the coupon works, but they gave excuses on how it's the way it is because their computer or cashier was like that. The manager just didn't want to refund our money back at all with the excuses he gave. The ice cream wasn't even that good when we got it, it looked half way melted and sloppy. The cup was suppose to be held upside down for you and they didn't even bother because it was so melted. Even the cup was dirty and had ice cream around it. At least clean it right? Never coming back here again. If you like Dairy Queen don't come to this location. They will treat you horribly and because we looked young, we were treated like kids and not like customers at all.",0
"MY DOG WAS MISDIAGNOSED DUE TO CARELESSNESS RESULTING IN OVER $700 IN EMERGENCY VET BILLS. Do NOT bring your dog here. I brought in my pup who clearly had a UTI infection. After treating her with a round of antibiotics, they asked me to bring back in a urine sample and gave me no instructions on how. I asked for a sterile container and was not given one. When I returned the sample in a plastic container I had, a fly had managed to get itself inside the sample. They told me no big deal. Then they tell me she still has a UTI infection even though her symptoms were gone and prescribed me a different antibiotic, Baytril. This is where it gets morbid. My dog ended up having a severe allergic reaction to the medication, resulting in a visit to the emergency room at 2am because of her aggressively scratching her ear/neck to the point of blood. They had to cone her, sedate her, give her steroids and Benedryl shots, and she still wasn't fine. I ended up taking her into another vet (Sunday) to where they assisted with giving her sedatives, anti itch, anti inflammatory, and steroids to go home with. We are now in Day 3 with my dog trying to rip her own ear off. I call into Blue Cross and ask them when this should pass since all the other vets told me this was NOT normal and this was VERY severe and I was afraid for her life. Blue Cross tells me it's no big deal and if she isn't OK by Day 5 then to worry. Day 6 - have not received a single follow up from Blue Cross. Re-test her urine with the new vet and   BEHOLD SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A UTI and I can only assume the false reading was because of  testing a non sterile sample. $700 in vet bills later, my sanity is gone, missed work, my poor pup has experienced enough tragedy for a lifetime, my house is covered in violent diarrhea stains, and I am more bitter than vinegar. All of this could have been prevented by SANITARY PRACTICES.My last bit: It is now Day 7 and I haven't received a single follow up call from Blue Cross. I've received four in total from the vet who took over. I think it's pretty clear who cares for my dog's health.",0
The crossroads of bad food and worse service. Some of the food was so bad that one taste made you spit it out. The rest of the food was cold. The server was never to be found. We had to get up and search through the restaurant four different times when we needed our server. Don't waste your time or money here. Your better off eating fast food.,0
"The first time I was in Du Café, I liked the décor, but I noticed the absence of customers. (This area doesn't really get a lot of street traffic). The coffee was OK, and I liked the macaroons. But the café is falsely advertised, because after inquiring of an employee, I learned that the food does contain significant amounts of sugar (the proprietress advertises little or no sugar), and everything but the macaroons contained gluten (she advertises gluten-free).I found the proprietress to be very loud and over-the-top, and she wouldn't stop talking. It was hard to make an exit from her café. The employees, on the other hand, were very friendly and helpful.I did like the café enough to go back a second time, but unfortunately did not even get to order my coffee before I witnessed the proprietress screaming at someone, presumably an employee. The other employees were cringing.Needless to say, I will NEVER go back again!",0
"I  write this on behalf of my friend that works in downtown Charlotte. Location is everything when you have a 8am-6pm in a city. When you can find a business located near work, it can be the best experience. NOT IN THIS CASE. All he wanted to do was have the soles of Timberlands repaired. He is no shoe expert,but he figured the soles just needed to be glued, so he left it up to this business that claims to fix shoes to tend to his needs. He dropped his shoes on a Tuesday and was told to pick them up Friday. Since he had prepaid $10 for an ""easy fix"", he return that Friday to retrieve his belongings. Looking back now, he realized he should have inspected his items a little more closely. NORMALLY, when you drop shoes at a cobbler they do the common courtesy of buffing your shoes after service. This was not done. There was glue everywhere the sole had been pasted. He returned to ask them to please buff it out and THEY REFUSED. He asked several times and they said no. He walked out in disbelief but decided his sanity was worth more than a disrespectful staff member. When he inspected the shoes more thoroughly at home, he realized that only a portion of the sole was glued down. WHO DOES THAT? He decided to return to the business, not even to complain, but to make them do the work that he paid for. Unfortunately, the next visit was just as ridiculous! He tried to explain to the man at the counter that the work wasn't done. The response? ""You only asked me to do the front.""(Last time I checked, the sole can run front to back of most shoes.) My friend said his look of shock should have straightened out the situation but to no avail. He again requested they do the work he paid for. The employee said for an additional cost he would do it. A woman who works there joined the fiasco. She even accused my friend of damaging the shoes again himself. I could write so much more about the back and forth that occurred, but I think you get the point. THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE and my friends shoes are not fixed. He would reccomend you look for a better cobbler shop, Top Shoe Repair they are not!",0
WORST LUNCH EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  A little crowded but took an hour and came out wrong. Archaic (twice) handwritten order system and no managerial oversight. Owners must suck every dime out of the business.  No empathy whatsoever about the situation.  Will never return.,0
"If only no stars were an option....Not only the worst car dealership I've ever dealt with, but the worst business in general. It's no wonder they have an ""F"" from the BBB and a pretty crappy yelp rating. Everyone other than Josh from maintenance/repair and Bonnie are crooks. Orlando, the sales guy, was  completely misleading. The finance guy was condescending. I could go into more detail, l but I've tried to let it go because there is nothing else I can do. I tried battling them for weeks. Long story short- I feel completely ripped off by Riverview Toyota. But all that matters is they got their sale. Seriously- if you are looking for a new/used car, go elsewhere!! I'd sooner by from craigslist or the side of the street than go back to Riverview Toyota!!!",0
"Service was great. Atmosphere awesome food comes with hair. Ordered a po boy, thought it came without hair but unfortunatly it didn't. Smoke house burger bun is soggy and so is the fries. JC WTF!  I'd rather grill at home. So sorry to give a sucky review. I was looking forward to giving a 5 star. Food is over priced and NOT WORTH IT UNLESS U WANNA LEAVE HUNGRY! I feel sorry for the severs.",0
"I just literally threw my sandwich away. So I was in the drive thru for 10 mins, no biggie I guess it was a rush? Anyways, I get my food and the fries are lukewarm/ cold... I'm still like no big deal. Then, I get home and pick off the lettuce with brown spots and while doing that, there's a hair in the sandwich... Cold fries are one thing, but waiting for a while to get food to find out that there's some others persons hair that you don't know what area it fell off from. Dude, I'll probably find another location to eat at tbh. I'm just really grossed out!",0
"Ordering was quick and easy, all that I ordered was Wonton soup and Potstickers. Potstickers were over fried and dry, but the sauce served with them was delicious! The wontons had ZERO filler. I double checked, literally every wonton had no fill in it. Very flavorless wontons too.",0
"I'm not going to repeat a lot of what is already said here (although I agree with every negative comment), but I'll list some things from my recent experience so you'll hopefully never go here:- place was empty on a weekend during lunchtime- were not greeted nicely and quickly- ketchup and hot sauce bottles on table were empty- burger wasn't cooked as ordered- food was average at best- hd tv's don't have hd channels- cooks and servers are unkept and not friendly- menu is very low quality- took forever to get the check once I requested it (we were 2 of 4 people there)- there was some kind of spilled food all over the sidewalk in front of the door that had been there for a while- saw the cook who made our food smoking a cigarette outside by my car when we were leaving. He was wearing his cooking apron as he was smoking. Go to Burgatory if you want an amazing Burger in Pittsburgh.",0
Horrible overpriced sub-par food. All undercooked pizza and calzones. Terrible live music. Don't waste your time. Pleasant and courteous server though. Travel to the closest Grimaldi's. Totally worth the drive.,0

"Poor communication and service.  After my main provider left I was bounced between several providers who failed to match the service I previously had.  Update:This office asked me to not be a patient anymore which is fine.  When asked if I wanted my medical records I said no I didn't need them.  They took it upon themselves to send my medical records along with a nasty personal letter to my home.  I do not know where this letter or my records are as somebody now has the hard copy that was sent to me without my permission.  Think twice before doing business here, these people do not value personal privacy and should not have access to confidential or private information.",0
"Very very slow service, it took the server 15 minutes to come to our table just to welcome us and ask what we want to drink.And another 10 minutes to bring the drinks. The salad was very small and when we asked why yesterday it was much bigger the server said he doesn't know .Definitely not coming here anymore.",0
"Don't waste your time waiting for these guys to give you a bid.  Use someone else.  I called these guys on a Thursday to get a bid on running a gas line for a Dryer.  They only stop by if they are in the area, so I waited a week but didn't hear from them.  I called them a week and a half later to see if they were going to stop by; I was told that they did stop by and were preparing a bid. I called a couple more times that week and was told they were working on the bid. I never received a bid, I wasted 2 weeks and still need to find someone to run this line.  Start with someone else, it'll be faster.",0
"Horrible customer service, on two separate occasions I had to go back into the store after paying for gas because the lady forgot to start the pump,there always a long line and it never fails everytime i enter the store the cashier is either in the back room or the rest room, with no sense of urgency what so ever, makes me so frustrated seeing that It's called a convenient store for a reason.",0
"What was supposed to be a special occasion turned into an utter nightmare. It's never fun when you have to leave caring a crying child because he so hungry after waiting 40 minutes after ordering with still no food.This is the fourth time I visited. The first was when it first opened and we waited quite some time for food. When it arrived, they informed my vegetarian friend that they could not make her food because they didn't have the ingredients. They had waited until everybody else's food was out before informing her. The restaurant was new, so I gave it another chance and went two more times. The food is ok, and service has always been slow, but you can't beat the location. However, tonight was awful. Once we were seated, the waiter took our drink orders but failed to bring mine. I had to remind him TWO more times to bring me a drink.Then, after waiting 40 minutes after we ordered, we decided it wasn't worth waiting anymore. We tried to flag down the waiter several times to either speak to the manager, find the status of her food, or just pay for the drinks and go. He looked at us, acknowledged us twice, but would never come over and speak to us knowing that something was wrong. Never in my life I have done this, but we just got up and left with my kid crying saying that he was soo hungry. To my credit, I again tried to flag somebody down to pay for my drink, but I couldn't even find somebody that was willing to even speak to me. I work near this location, and have many coworkers, so I need to let the restaurant know that they have lost a chunk of business from my colleagues. Shame on you. The only redeeming thing is that we ended up spending a lot less money at McDonald's :-) it was just not the night that we were hoping for.",0

The first time I ordered, some guy who sounded wayyyyyy stoned took my order but got it all wrong for delivery. Charged me for an XL but got a small.  Finally got the right pizza but it was cold. Took a SECOND chance and the same guy delivered me a VERY STALE, cold large pizza.  Very disappointed.",0

"I've never dealt with more snobs in my life that I have at this restaurant. My wife and I went here for a couple drinks and appetizers before attending a movie in the same complex.  Our first server, didn't catch his name but he was old enough to be my grandfather, essentially scoffed at us once we told him we didn't want to have dinner but only a couple appetizers and drinks.  After putting in our drink order of some peach iced tea special they had (nothing on the drink menu sounded tasty), he disappeared and sent a younger waiter to help us.  Neither offered an explanation of why the change, but I assume its because Grandpa expected to receive a crappy tip since we weren't there for dinner.  We ordered the Margherita flatbread and ravioli appetizer.  The flatbread was a good concept, but when I think ""flatbread."" I think flat bread.  This tasted more like a New York style thin crust pizza.  The raviolis were good but tasted like they were frozen and thrown into an oven for a few minutes.One of my biggest pet peeves while dining out is having an empty glass.  Between the iced tea and a water that I ordered afterwards, both went empty before a refill was offered.  Additionally, after we finished everything, we sat there, with all plates and glasses stacked at the end of the table signifying that we were done, for about 10 minutes before our server finally appeared for the first time since taking our order (no one came to check to see if everything was okay after food was brought out.)In conclusion, I rated this restaurant a ""1"" due to a commercialized food taste as well as receiving a level of service that was amazingly horrible.  This place is the very reason people call the area ""Snobbsdale"" and never in a million years would I recommend this place to my worst enemy.",0
"Had a pretty bad experience this past weekend had me waiting for over 2 hours and because there computers wore down and never asked if I was ok or anything the only thing the woman in the front told me was ""if you guys want you guys can go walk while it comes back"" meanwhile I got 3 tired kids after a 5 hour drive! And no sympathy or anything and when I tried talking to a manager completely ignored!",0
"Summary:  My air conditioner would stop working from time to time for short periods of time.   In July, a Hobaica tech came to my house and did an inspection and regular maintenance and said the unit was fine.   Three days later, the AC isn't working properly.   I was forced to fix it myself because it was the weekend.   Hobaica did NOT address or fix the issue but in five minutes of research, I did.   POOR SERVICE.   Details:   On July 24, 2019, I had a Hobaica service technician come out to my house for a AC tuneup.   The tech arrived on time and gave me a call when he was on his way.  When the Hobaica tech arrived, I told the tech my AC would sometimes stop blowing cold air and only blow warm air.   The tech later inspects my AC unit and says everything looks and tested good.   Three days later on a Saturday, my AC is blowing hot air and the house heats up to over a 100F.   My family and I plus our pets were forced to leave and went to a family member's house.  Long story short:  I watched one Youtube video and learned it was likely a bad capacitor.  The next day (Sunday), I went on the roof and visually inspected all four capacitors in my AC unit to find one of the capacitors had a noticeably bulge on the top and on the bottom.   I used a multi meter and tested the capacitor and verified it was bad.  Mind you, it took about five minutes to do this.  I don't understand how a trained Hobaica technician missed this on July 24.  I have no HVAC experience and after one YouTube video and five minutes of inspection, I was able to figure out the problem.   I was pretty upset because I had to uproot my family and spend time and money to fix something that a Hobaica technician failed to address or resolve.  I do NOT recommend Hobaica.   I expected top notch, knowledgeable Hobaica HVAC service and technicians but they fell short.   I understand you can't catch all issues with a AC.  But in this case, I pointed it out and they failed to address it.   At the end of the day, it was a quick, basic fix which I fixed because they failed to do so.",0

"Other than the fact that APA holds its events there I would never return to this place. Have stayed twice and both times it was a hassle. Last year in August, came for APA Nationals. Upon arrival check in took over an hour and that was just the time at the counter. I was told that they had no record of my reservation even though I had the conformation print out in my hand. After talking with the supervisor they found a room but seperate from my group. I was told they had to run my card again but would reimburse me in 24 hours. Why, I was already charged prior, smh. After receiving the room, on the third night I was locked out. When I went to the service desk I was told that when the new reservation was made by the attendant that it was only for 2 nights, wow! Another 20 minutes to straighten out. But wait it gets better. On my latest visit in March the morning after check in there was no hot water in room. I had to contact a friend in the hotel to ask if my girlfriend could use their shower, absurd and very inconvenient for a supposed resort casino. To top it off on the final morning of our stay at 430am the emergency alarm starts blarring forcing me to jump out of bed and informing us that they are currently experiencing an emergency and will keep us posted if further action is needed. This bullhorn continued on for 10 minutes, felt like some sort of boot camp. Worst experience ever with any type of business. This is no even including the staff that hounds you once your in the lobby to purchase time shares and show tickets. No positives here.",0
Yeah...not flying this airline again. Cheap tickets aren't that cheap after everything is said and done. Website sucks. Online check in was an unnecessary hassle.,0
Never have I ever had to wait in an outside restaurant with the waitress purposely ignoring out table to even be acknowledge then 30 minutes nor e for a cocktail the have the manager stop at the table to tell us the kitchen is really backed up....umm we ordered chips and salsa...yelp review but I will tell whoever I can!!,0
"I scheduled an appointment to have photos taken of my twin grandbabies as a surprise Christmas present.  We arrived a little before our appointment time to be told there were three families ahead of us still waiting to be photographed. The place felt like it was a cattle run, a lot of noisy kids.  I was not told it was not a private setting.  We waited over an hour, by then the babies were so cranky they were miserable during their photo shoot so we only managed to get three good shots.  I will never use this place again and I definitely not recommend it to my friends.",0
Horrible service. They lost my order twice. I waited nearly a month and again no glasses. One insult after another. I called was put on hold hung up on and spun in circles.This place is a nightmare. One train wreck after another.Go any place else and  you will do better.,0
"Tammy S. Is correct, had tour of Italy it looked to be microwaved. The fettuccine noodles were hard and over cooked. For pictures of the tour of Italy look at Tammy S. post. Mine looked just like that. Me and my wife tried the tiramisu (custard desert) it was half frozen. The sangria apple moscato pitcher was not worth the money. Loaded with ice and barely any wine. Salad was ok, overloaded with dressing. Bread ok. On top of all that, we had to wait a long time for our order and they were not busy. It felt like the food came from TV dinners.",0
"currently attending for an associate and 4 months in , the on site classes are fine but the online classes are garbage , every online class I'm a struggling ,it seem the teacher is there to collect only paycheck not to teach. the staff is lazy it takes serval days of calls for something to happen. It feels like they are more interested in your money then your education , watch out for this school it expensive and not worth your time and money,",0
"DO NOT order online whatever you do! It is 4:26 right now, I ordered the pizza at 2:25.  They blame the hour delay on the 24/7 app that you can order pizza through. I called at 3:45 to ask about the pizza and the lady I spoke to explained the situation and said they didn't get the order until 3:20, which she believed to justify the hour delivery time.  At 4:08 I got a call from the delivery driver saying he was at the palms, which I am at the luxor...he kept tryinging to tell me I gave the adress for the palms. I TRIPLE CHECKED! Nope. I gave the right address. Called the restaurant back. Same nonsense about my order not coming in until an hour after the intial order. Maybe they should use a different program for online ordering. 4:36 Delivery guy just called me to explain that he had no idea where the room was ...I tried as clear as I could to explain it and he hung up on me. I am beyond upset at this point....I have no idea if he is coming or if I am screwed out of $30! It is now 2 hours and 30 minutes and I get called to the front desk to pick up my pizza...get the pizza back to the room....pizza is cold and order is wrong...we were also told we would get a complimentary 2 liter for the inconvenience....we did not.",0
"The pizza is decent pizza, most of the time. However, everyone who works there either has no manners or is completely rude. If you're gonna get pizza in squirrel hill just take your business anywhere else because I guarantee they'll be 1000% better.",0
"They are close to my work, has plenty of choices, so I go at least twice a week for lunch. Yesterday I started to eat and found the fork had a sharp spot and cut my upper lip. So I went to the waitress changed a fork and told her it cut. Later during my eating, it bothered me, due to the different food, and raw sushi, I think it is better to record it. I told the waitress again that I was cut, if it went away it would be fine, if it got infected, I would have to go to doctor and gave them the bill. She said ""oh, I thought you said the fork was dirty, I put it in the wash. You need to talk to manager. ""The manager came, a young guy, i described what happened, he said it was impossible. I told him "" I come here eat often, I am not here to make trouble...Can you write it up."" He said ok and went to the utensils wash to search for the fork. I felt the wound stung bad when I ate pineapple. After I finished, the manager was still writing the record. Then I was given it to sign"" In the end he wrote, they could not find the fork in the bin. I asked him what was the purpose of putting it there, saying I was not telling the truth? He said ""it would be for insurance, they pay you, we don't, we searched and didn't find it, you can explain to insurance."" I asked him how he searched, he said looked. I said ""if I could see the thorn would I stuck into my mouth?! You have to touch it along the edge."" He again said ""it is between you and insurance, you can explain to them."" By then I was upset and told him more people would get hurt by this.If you eat there, chopsticks probably safer. If you use those small thin steel forks, be sure to run your finger along the edges ensure no sharps.",0
Awful place to eat.Our food was cold and biscuit was so hard couldn't even cut the biscuit with a knife.We counted 19 people walked out because they couldn't get seated or service.This place really needs a lot of attention.Don't waste your money.Worst Restaurant in Gastonia!!!!!Will never be back calling corporate today!!!!,0
I bought 2 new Toyotas from this dealership.  The service center is the worst ever!  They lie and try to sell you anything they can.  Toyota Camrys have a BIG problem losing oil.  They won't admit it.   The service people look at you like you are stupid and say that a oil test should be done  when you bring it to their attention!  They will not say a word about the oil problem when you are under warranty.  Just check the internet for Toyota camry oil problems/losing oil.  Stay away from this dealership!!!,0
"We went to the Bloor and Bay ""flagship""  store to look at engagement rings.  The only flagship thing about that store was the attitude:  noone greeted us at the entrance, even though there were no customers at the store.  The sales woman (I think her name was Monique) acted like she didn't want to be bothered.  She was very standoffish and didn't even introduce herself until we were leaving, when she needed our contact information for the mailing list.  On top of everything, the saleswoman asked me if I was Turkish (which I am not even close).  I like Turkish people and don't care but I can see how it can be offensive for some people.  For the outrageous prices Birks charges for their diamond rings I expected much more polished customer service.  We got a much better GIA-certified diamond from BlueNile for half the price!Birks sells diamonds that are certified by Birks, haha!",0
"this is the worst service I've ever encountered here. Trying to get a soda so far has taken over 40 minutes. It would make sense to have more than 2 people at each service bar. If you plan a big event, plan more help. Highly dissappointed in Coyote country fest this year!",0
"They mixed up orders for the wedding party, which meant that I had to make three cross town trips between their Madison locations to fix their mistake, only to have them give me a tuxedo that fit poorly anyways. Instead of them suggesting different sizes that made sense, we had to fight them every step of the way to arrange for me to get something that fit me at all. They promised me compensation for my trouble, but didn't communicate this between stores and are currently wasting more of my time calling each other and debating how much to compensate me. ""You're going to like the way you look""? False.",0
I used to come here because it's really cheap $45 for a 90 min. Massage...but most of the minutes goes to them talking or going somewhere. I feel cheated sometimes ...and front desk they are very rude.,0

He then called us when we were out of office on Saturday with payment instructions and canceled Sunday night via email. He didn't state in any call or email that he was unsure of our willingness to work with him and had been in discussion with us for weeks about several jobs so there never should have been doubt.Now he is saying we're running a scam.

Now here's something sketchy, for whatever reason the employee had me create a profile for my account on her tablet, had to type in my password and all that. At the moment I didn't think much of it. Fast forward bout two weeks later and my account gets hacked. Someone some how upgrades a line on my account to a iphone x with a card that i had on file and ships it to Arizona.

"WOW (not in a good way)!  I cannot explain the level of frustration I have with this company.  After the home warranty (OneGuard) approved a replacement on my water heater, Pruitt was hired to replace the 40 gallon water heater in my loft.  I travel quite a bit so about a month later, when I finally got to use my house more frequently, I noticed the hot water was not coming down hot, nor have adequate pressure, so I called Pruitt for help.  They did not respond.  I called back after the holidays and after I returned back to my house to see why there was no response but I was told Pruitt has a 30 day guarantee and I need to go back to OneGuard (and likely pay more fees), just to have them check their work??  WTH?  The Warranty on the unit has 05/24/2018, and Pruitt just needs to come verify that the water heater is performing correctly, make adjustments, or whatever else.  I would never willingly hire this company for ANYTHING!  I may have to have a second opinion, and follow up with this post.",0
"I don't think I would stay here again unless it is absolutely necessary.  The staff at check-in were very nice, although it took awhile to locate my reservation which I made online on their website(a little odd). The bed is very uncomfortable and the shower temperature kept switching from hot to cold to hotter and then colder. When I told the front desk they just said ""ok"". The faucet on the sink was not working properly either and when you went to use it, it splashed everywhere including things that were plugged in right next to the sink bc there was no other place to put it. It was a bit scary... There were also a lot of other hazards in the room like housekeeping looking in your window(for a reason most likely unexplainable) at your naked husband, oh and all the plugs almost completely detached from the wall! I would most likely not stay here again. It needs an upgrade and the rooms need to be cleaned alot better!",0

Getting worse every time we come in here. Service is terrible. Incredibly slow. Every time we come in people are complaining about either not getting their food at all or having to wait way too long for their food to arrive. Don't recommend at all.

She started my massage and kept answering the phone so she could work with one hand. Then she left and had some else finish. Foot reflexology was not what I would consider true reflexology. Just over rated pedicure massage. Very disappointed with this visit. Just dim lights and don't talk while you are working.",0

"Today I thought I would treat myself and purchase new bras. I was so looking forward to my experience because it was so pleasant last year when I visited the stonecrest store.  As soon as I walked in there was total silence and the associate at the counter did not even look up to acknowledge me. She continued to place items on hangers  and I continued to walk toward her and then past her as she hung up the items. I was able to browse around the entire small store and proceeded to walk around for a second time, but decided to say goodbye to the associate before departing. She then smiled at me and was starting to thank me, but realized that I was not happy. Another associate had entered the store as I walking out and she asked if everything was okay and I told her NO. I let her know that I was completely ignored by the associate at counter and was leaving the store. She looked totally suprised because we were literally the only two people in a store that you could hear a pin drop. The associate finally spoke up and said that she did not see me.  I thought to myself, you can't be serious and you shouldn't be working by yourself if you can't multitask. You should always keep you eyes on the door of your business or at least look up occasionally because we are living in a different time and it is important to have good safety practices in place. I believe that I would have had a better experience with the second associate because she was greeting me as I was leaving and didn't even know why I was leaving so the one star is for her.",0

The spraining of his ankle was the last straw. The owner choose not to end things amicably. They have a staff of predominantly teenagers who seem neglectful and unaware of the dogs during playtime. I do not recommend this daycare facility to my friends with dogs or strangers looking for a safe environment for their dog/s.",0
"I almost never leave reviews for poor service because I think its tacky. However what happened to me with this dealership more than calls for it.I drove my Chicago to Cleveland on Tuesday morning for some work meetings. Upon entering Avery my tire pressure warning came on. I pulled over at a gas station to put some air in my tires and noticed my drivers side front tire was almost bald. My Cayenne S was in need of a re alignment so this was 100% the cause of the rim of the tire being worn down on the 5 hour drive. I called around and nobody had the size tires I needed. I spoke with Patrick at Beachwood Porsche and he said they didn't have the Cooper's I needed but they had Goodyear's that would fit so I decided to make the trek to Beachwood Porsche driving under 50 mph the whole way. Less than 5 minutes away from the dealership my check engine light came on. (Such a horrible day)I arrived and met Patrick. I told him that my check engine light came on and that I needed that checked. He said there was no way they would be able to switch my tires and do an alignment before the end of the day and I said that was fine. I didn't need to be back in Chicago until Wednesday night so picking it up the next day was fine. I just needed them to make sure it was fit to drive because it's a 5+ hour drive and I didn't want any issues.I told him please call me if there was any other issues with the engine or anything else they came across or as soon as it was ready the next day so that I could get on the road right away. He said no problem he would.The next day around 11 am I begin wondering why I hadn't heard anything yet so I decided to call. The service desk phone number rang and rang rang with no answer. Not even a machine. I called the main phone number and the woman directed me back to it. Again no answer. I waited an hour and called back. I told her nobody was answering the next time I called at noon and she said she would go back there and check. I was connected finally with Walt. Walt told me Patrick was out that day (Awesome of somebody to tell me) and that my car had been ready for hours.I took a cab out to Beachwood to pick it up. My bill came to $991 dollars with over $350 of it being labor. I asked him if the engine was ok and he said it was a false trip and that everything was fine. They just needed to top the oil off a little bit. I thanked them paid and got on the highway back to Chicago. After driving 45 minutes my check engine light came back on. After driving another 10 minutes it began flashing. Knowing that this is a dreaded sign I pulled over right away and called the dealership. I called.... and called... and called.... No answer. Front desk transferred me again, no answer. Waited another 20 minutes on the side of the road and tried again, no answer.I decided to chance it driving 50 back to Chicago. The majority of the ride was fine, slow but fine, but whenever the engine would downshift the car would shake and it took longer than usual to decelerate. I'm assuming its a transmission issue. When the auto shop I took it to last night gets back to me and lets me know what it is I will know for sure. I find it incredible that an actual Porsche dealership would overlook and brush off an issue I asked them explicitly to inspect. Especially after wacking me with a 350 labor charge on top of a 240 alignment. And to top it off it was nearly impossible to get anybody on the phone.",0
"I had a great time at Julia's UYE here!  I was not sure what to expect, and I had a really good time.  I was not impressed by the restaurant however.  The place in funky and fun, and I really liked the eclectic decor.  The people are very friendly, and the food was tasty.  I had a great soup that I enjoyed very much. HOWEVER, I feel that the staff took advantage of our entire group.  Two people ordered small appetizers in which the staff took the opportunity to turn into multiple, small, $25 appetizer plates. We were not expecting this, and it inflated our bill dramatically.  I would say there was a little bit of a language barrier between us, but the staff certainly was able to flatly say they had explained it to us.  I feel we were  treated rudely, and our bill was deliberately inflated as no one else was in the restaurant.  The food was good, but certainly not worth the price, and although I will forgive many breaks of service, when it is done deliberately, I will not go back.  All in all I had a wonderful time with the group (thank you all!!!!), but I will not return here on my own.",0
"This morning I stopped in to get 2 packs of Camels with a $1.50 off coupon, and they wouldn't take it. They said the pricing was already low because they are on a reservation. Cashier seemed grumpy, and not only that, when I got back on the road, she had charged me for 3 packs of cigarettes, when I only bought 2 and received 2. Double whammy. No coupon, and over charged. Not a good way to start the day!!",0

"I'll start from the beginning... When this place is busy (for some unknown reason) the parking is a nightmare due to the lack of space and the inexperienced drivers. The absolute WORST thing was me witnessing the valet girl stalling someone's car. I really couldn't help but laugh - why would you be valeting cars if you didn't know how to drive stick?!When you walk in everything is kind of new and trendy looking. I noticed a lot of younger people like to go here so if that's not your crowd then this isn't where you want to be after 7pm. I personally don't like ""trendy-young-and-cool"" sushi spots. I've only gone for dinner time so I can't speak for what it's like at lunch. The few times I've been here the sushi wasn't all that great - and I feel I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to the sushi department. I try to give new places a chance so I've been here maybe 3 times. Sushi still wasn't all that, our service always left something to be desired, and the last straw....I COULD NOT BELIEVE after mediocre borderline poor service, our waitress had THE NERVE to hand me our bill and circle the suggested tip she wrote down. Seriously? I always tip my servers well and accordingly, and a whole lot more when the service is excellent. I rounded out my bill to the next dollar and will never come back here again.",0
Just went to this Panera for lunch and was extremely disappointed. I love both Panera and Paradise Bakery but this one is not worth stopping at. I ordered their seasonal turkey apple cranberry sandwich. The lady at the register told me they were out of the cheese for that sandwich so she gave me other options which was fine! I proceeded to wait for my order for about 10 minutes when they called me up and told me they did not have the apples for the sandwich and if I wanted to pick somethings else. The restaurant was not busy so I'm not sure why it took so long for them to tell me that. I went back to look at the menu and picked out another sandwich to get. Once I told them it took another 10 minutes to make it. When I finally got my sandwich a lady called my name and did not even apologizing for not having the sandwich I had originally ordered or thanking me for waiting. Will not return to this location.,0
"I am sorry to be writing this review.  My first visit to Blue a few years ago was fabulous.  The service was very good!  But, this time not only was the food not impressive, but it was totally boring! The calamari appetizer was good, but not worth $11.00.  The hummus appetizer was 2 golf ball sized clumps with almost no flavor.  Not even arranged to be appealing to the eye.  My tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy, tasteless ,  glob with Carmelized onions on it that looked reheated...also not  flavorful.  The baked in house bread were blah, and butter was not offered.  It could have used it to help the taste.  Dessert was the same...an amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too long....dry.   I love good food.  But, this evening was an utter disappointment.  It was a birthday celebration, and I did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food.  I also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place I raved about prior to going. Service was great, but the server talked me out of a couple of things I considered getting.  Made me think whomever was doing the cooking that night...A Saturday was not good at certain things.  Extremely overpriced.  Btw...coffee was $6.50.  C'mon now!  Good but not that much!  Sorry, but I will not go back.  I was sooo looking forward to this special evening,  and it was an utter disappointment.",0
"This is probably one of the worst hotels in Las Vegas, when you check in make sure you bring your patience, because since the place is so cheap.. EVERYONE.. stays here, and this place clearly never doesn't have a concept of having too many guests, the name fits it well, it's like a  godamn circus in here, the staff is super rude, the rooms are extremely dirty and give you a motel 6 vibe, the only thing fun in the whole place is the water park.. but wait there's more.. since there's so many people checked in, the wait times for everything takes FOREVER, There is a huge line for everything, you're basically spending your whole day waiting for things that aren't even that great, even the pools are disgusting full of tons of people, if you want to enjoy your time in Vegas or are having a fun family trip. HIGHLY RECCOMENED TO INVEST IN STAYING ELSEWHERE!! because this place SUCKS",0
"I hate being a hater.  My first approach is to always resolve an issue with management before reverting to Yelp and the credit card co. to dispute a transaction.  This time, unfortunately, I must go all the way and bash the business.  My family and I bought a yogurt (self-serve, no brainer) and a crepe here.  Simple transaction.  I ordered a cinnamon / sugar crepe, probably the most basic of crepes in the world of creperies.  Short story shorter: they ran out of butter for the crepe, tried to pass off Crisco in a spray can as ""butter"" and wouldn't give me a refund when I didn't want that.",0
"To make it short:Great views. Great location. Close to light rail. But:  terrible building, A/C is communal - included in high monthly fees,  you pay if you use it or not. So people leave the A/C on. And you pay for it. Air ducts are connected throughout the building, or this is how it feels, because when your neighbors smoke - you smell it! Management has strange rules that are aimed not for servicing owners. You can put your name on a waiting list for a parking spot, but then you find out that the spot was given to a renter. Note: parking is not owned by unit owners. You never know when it would be taken away from you and given to someone who is buddy with management. Same with storage cages. Your personal relations with management will determine the level of service you get. We are happy we are out of there.",0
"Ate today at the Grill here at Century Downs.  We were seated quickly and got our drinks soon after.  My hubbys reuben sandwich came out hot and good.  My cobb salad left a lot to be desired.  It was a large bowl of lettuce with along the sides: hardboiled egg, 3 slices of avocado, 4 slices of tomato and same of cucumber.  Now it didnt look appetizing at all, more like a cheap house salad (altho i have had better house salads than this).  Then i realize its missing the crumbled blue cheese.   It was brought out separate after i pointed it out.  But then after i finished it, was still bugging me that something else was missing. Pulled up the menu online and yep they also forgot the maple glazed walnuts and dried fruit.  Wow you actually forgot to put 3 items on my salad!!  Horrible quality control.

"Long story short, we received a defective vehicle and the manager Ben Saxton clearly isn't going to help us in getting out of this nightmare of a vehicle. Home of the Slam JUNK deal is more like it!We purchased a used 2011 Dodge Durango with 14k miles back in July 2013.  We saw this vehicle as long term and we purchased the extended warranty.  Shortly after purchasing this car, it repeatedly wouldn't start.  Numerous times I was late to work, my son late to school or straight up just stranded wherever I happened to be at the time. It took THREE trips for the service department to finally fix THAT problem.  Despite the brakes being in great condition, they squeak and squeal so loud when braking. Not a huge issue, but shouldn't be happening and another thing the service department can't fix or isn't willing to.  Among the several other issues with this car and feeling like I live in the service department.... the air conditioning quit working when driving home from California the other weekend!!  We were in the middle of the desert and had no choice but to drive for 2+ hours with NO AC with a small child in the backseat! This has become ridiculous and I don't pay several hundred dollars a month to be dealing with such big issues and have a vehicle that is unreliable and a total piece of garbage!  We went into the dealership to talk to the manager Ben Saxton and tell him our entire history with the car. He promised us he would work something out to get us out of this problem vehicle. WRONG! He didn't help us at all. He left to run an errand while Charlie helped us look at other vehicles and when he arrived back, he walked right past us and we never saw him again. We left the dealership with our same piece of junk not knowing when it's going to break again and what's going to break.  It's a very bad spot to be in especially when driving around with kids.  I don't know when I'm going to get stranded again. Thanks Superstition Springs Chrysler for selling us a defective vehicle and not willing to help us get out of it.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!!",0
"It's taken me a while to write this. Back in August I began coming here to get facials. The esthetician that provided these services was named Kayla. Long story short, when she was doing extractions on me she was digging into my skin with the tool which caused me excruciating pain. She assured me this was normal, and when I came back for my second facial with numerous scars all over my face, she told me that was normal too because I had ""thinner skin"". Me being naive and putting my trust into someone with a license, I decided to continue to let her do her thing. The second time that I left my facial I got home to discover BROKEN CAPILLARIES ON MY FACE. She dug so hard into my skin she caused LIFETIME damage and scarring. I came there to heal my discoloration, acne, and acne scarring. Yet everytime I left an appointment I had more damage. Not to mention I never felt like she genuinely cared about my skin, she would spend majority of our session trying to push the spas products on me. Anyways I called and they offered me a complimentary facial. I can't remember the girls name but she was amazing. She didn't hurt me at all, left me with no scarring. She was so gentle and my skin instantly looked better, this was when I realized that the first woman who worked on me was being careless with my skin. Realizing that I'd spent over $200 for her to not only cause me damage but I was leaving tips too because I trusted her, I felt it was fair for me to get a refund. I was told I wouldn't be able to receive one because ""we didn't know anything was wrong, you kept scheduling appointments"" I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING WAS WRONG EITHER! I was seeing a licensed esthetician, obviously when I complained about something and she told me she was right I was going to trust her. I trusted them with my skin and gave my hard earned money just to leave with my face more damaged then when I started going there. Y'all better be careful before you decide to invest your money and time here. Make sure the person knows what they're doing. Don't make the same mistake I did. I still have the permanent damage on my face and its lifetime damage all thanks to them.",0

How do you mess up bacon?! Ate breakfast at the buffet yesterday and it was absolutely awful. The bacon was inedible (my 8 yr old wouldn't even eat it)...hot food was barely warm...mini bagels were hard and stale. Now turned off all the dining options at South Point...too many good places in Vegas to risk another meal is as awful as this was. Not a lot of point staying here again!,0
"I created an account on Yelp just so I could review Cafe 100 in Huntersville, NC. We had the worst experience we have ever had at any restaurant. We went to lunch at Cafe 100 and went inside, just as the sign says, "" wait to be seated"". We stood there for over ten minutes waiting for a hostess or waiter -  all of the servers just flew by and completely ignored us. We were on our way out when a waitress told us we could go to a table outside. We sat at the table for over another 10 minutes waiting for a server. When he finally came over we were ready to order both drinks and our food but he would only take the drink order. After ordering our meals much later, we had to wait another 30 minutes for our food. (as we were ignored)The cole slaw was warm, the veggie burger too spicy.The salad greens were also warm, wilted an had some brown coloring on the leaves. The dressing lacked flavor.Flies were all over us and our food.Needless to say,  we have never had worse customer service, and as residents of Huntersville, we will never return.",0

"I have been here often. it is usually a delighful little break during the day for lunch and a couple of times I have ventured over to take part in an evening meal. After my experience tonight I will not be back. My father, in from out of town, my boyfriend and I sat and watched as every table in the place recieved their orders....we waited and waited and waited. Our glasses ran dry, our bread all gone, and still no entree. At 1 hour 10 min wait we walked to the register asked for our check for our drinks and tried to leave. At that time the server argued with us then....then the manger came out to tell us we were wrong and had only been waiting 50 min. As much as the food is ok....the service is/was awful!",0

"I think the only word you really need to know is: COCKROACHES... yes indeed we had one walk up the table and perch himself over our table, when we brought it up to the waitress she had us stand up and then reached over and killed it with a napkin (while our food was still on the table). She didnt even apologize, she just brought the check over. That is pretty horrible, the owner or manager doesnt even come over? So we brought her back and asked for some kind of discount since its nasty as hell in there and we were all nauseously trying to keep the ""Indian"" food down. (and yes it gets scare quotes because that was some shitty ""Indian"" food.. have you ever had a palak paneer without cream? made with frozen spinach????) So she goes to talk to the guy behind the bar and then just throws the bill on the table without a word... If we were jerks about it that I would understand but no we were pretty nice about the whole deal...  so my husband goes to the guy behind the bar and he then gives us a 10% discount, spluttering, ""the place upstairs was just fumigated"" yeah right... and my name is Kumar....its quite concerning that a roach is just going to show up on the wall and chill out under bright lights... that usually is indicative of an infestation. But mostly it was just the way the owner/manager and the waitress treated us. we didnt put your roach there dudes,  have some graciousness and treat us nice, say your sorry, come over to our table, take a meal off the bill, give us a glass of wine or a dessert. SOMETHING. I felt like these people just want you to go, eat like cows at their buffet trough then F off and leave them money. it was horrible.",0
Really disappointed with my daughter's treatment as the doctor basically just prescribed an ointment for a small lump that she has on her eyelid.  Did nothing to take care of the problem and we will not be returning.  I decided to take her to another specialist.

"Based on the better than average reviews for Chinese buffets in the area, we decided to give this place a try. Clearly it is a dive which we do not mind at all as long as the food is good. The food was awful. Everything on the buffet had clearly been sitting there for who knows how long and the selection was pitiful. The chicken was so dry I kept thinking of the scene in Christmas Vacation when the turkey explodes into dust when they cut into it. We sampled pretty much everything they had to offer on the buffet and it was all terrible. Even the sodas were watered down. I'm baffled at the average and up ratings that others have given this place. We clearly weren't expecting 5 star out of a dive but this was pathetic.",0
Literally the most incompetent people and did not take the time to respect an underage designated driver that was with the group. Will not be going to this location again,0
"Been here twice, first time our chicken was severely undercooked and had to send it back.So we just tried it again....First of all my margarita was a glass full of ice and after 3 sips it was empty!We ordered a house salad with no onions and fish tacos....Food took over 30 minutes, they had to check on it.... Salad came with onions and was drowning in the dressing.Fish tacos came, The rice was cold, the tacos were cold and the side of guacamole had a disgusting brown color all over it.When we sent it back the manager came over and made excuses about how they were short staffed one chef in the kitchen. He was very nonchalant and aloof about it.A shame the kitchen & food are so unorganized.It's very obvious they need new management!",0
"Stopped in at 9:40pm and noticed right away all employees were hard at work getting the closing ( 10:00pm) duties done. We were ignored for a short while while they were cleaning. Two things really stood out that bothered me. The first was the girl that helped us was sweeping and cleaning put her cleaning stuff down and didn't wash her hands. She grabbed the cone above the protective paper cover. I Just wasn't comfortable knowing whatever she touched while cleaning was now on the cone. Upon request she washed her hands. Shortly afterward another employee walked up and did the exact same thing!!!  Clearly these employees were not properly taught about health code practices (or just ignore them). We also saw the girl spray the work space in front of the ice cream buckets with cleaning solution before wiping it down. You could see the mist drifting into the ice cream buckets. The place was clean and presentable. I just question the staff (or some of the staff) at this location, especially when it's close to closing time.",0

I am 60% hearing impaired and would have left without ordering had I known how loud and bad the music was....what ever happened to Irish music?  Last but not least, the beer prices were so high, that out of about 16 tables of patrons around us, only ONE person drank beer......that is over 50 patrons who refused to pay the price at the Kilt!  And the temperature outside was about 100 degrees!  NO HAPPY HOUR EITHER!!  My wife and I would have each had TWO at a reasonable price.

"I am not one to typically right a bad review unless it is well deserved and this place happens to be the worst club experience I've been part of. I should of seen the first red flag when this was the only club without a massive line. I arrived at the club with my girlfriend and her friend. They are both women of color which I will get into why that matters next. As we get to the front of the line I paid the cover charge. Literally within ten steps this goon that was a bouncer grabbed my friend who happens to be black and said you are kicked out for being intoxicated. Now that completely shocked me because I was with her all day and she had two drinks in a 4 hour period. He immediately was rude and argumentive. I asked him to state what he saw that indicated she was intoxicated. He said she stumbled which was odd because I was walking right behind her and she walked as straight as an arrow. If she was truly intoxicated they should of never let her through the door. The bouncer called about 5 other bouncers to assist. I said we just walked in so I'm ok with leaving but then we should get our money back. He said follow them and they will work with the GM to make that happen. It was a trick to get us out. The GM was there and immediately was confrontational with everyone. He acted like a child not a GM. He would not even listen to our concerns or even entertain the idea of being a professional. The best part is I asked the police officer across the street if my friend can blow into the breathilizer. The police let her and she blew a .04. So apparently she was sober enough to drive but not sober enough to be a classy black woman at the club. I would urge everyone to stay away from here. Read the other negative reviews and you will see a theme of racism, shakedowns, theft, dishonesty, and no accountability. If the owners read these reviews they might want to get serious and take action before these incidents escalate into something more serious.",0

"I hired these guys to sell a property for me that my uncle owned in Scottsdale.  I was directly involved with hiring Hague partners and lived in the house during the sale.  I was included in all the e-mails and I was consulted on all the details in the transaction.  I was the one that chose this real estate company, it was my decision as I acted in good faith in hiring this company.   They now want to say my review isn't valid because I Technically didn't own the property even though I hired them.  They were not honest to my uncle that owned the property.  Read the fine print before signing with these guys sell in 72 hours program.  Market value is subjective.Hague the broker refused to return calls and address real issues or complaints.  I Made the decision to hire them and my uncle went along with my decision,  about a week later after information came to light I decided to terminate the relationship and the listing agent would not allow us to cancel. I believe there is unethical behavior and they employ gorilla marketing tactics.  They like to approach for sale by owner homes and make appointments with fake buyers to try and get themselves in the door.  Never allow them into your for sale by owner home.  They bring their friends and family posing as buyers and lie constantly about having ""cash buyers"".  Dave and Nolan know all about this.  They are not loyal, by perception and experience there is a lot of elements of dishonesty.This is not conjecture an ex-employee of the broker that sold the property shared in great detail and in writing the fraud and deceptive trade practices like altering photos of the grass and interior elements as well.  I have evidence of all these facts.I remodel the house to a very high level and it sold in one day because of the high end remodel, the realtor of course claims they were the reason.   The realtor was the problem and completely fumbled the inspection issues and made statements about the cost of repairs that weren't true and completely misleading.Takes more than a commercial on TV to be successful.  Honesty, transparency, and integrity should have been present and was not.",0

"WAITED 2 HOURS FOR FOOD TO BE DONE!Decided to come here with my sister's basketball team because there was a groupon deal...who knew this eating experience would be so agonizing.Sure we came in with a pretty large party of 20 or so, but does it really take almost 2hrs to make everyone's orders? We're STILL waiting to get some people's orders out. I ordered a mushroom wrap and part of it was even burnt. And as I got to the end of the FRIED BATTERED chicken piece, there was a big chunk of fried...crisp. What the heck! I couldn't even finish it...and that wrap was $4.95! Rip off!Note to the owner: If you plan to run a restaurant that holds a capacity of close to 40 people and want to keep your customers happy and satisfied...at LEAST higher some more staff!

Basically no response from either the property or Red Roof corporate, so it's a no-fly zone for me until I have some assurance that either they've checked the booking system for hacking or the front desk card terminals for a skimmer.

"I am on the board of directors of a property managed by Osselaer. I can honestly say that I had many issues with my account to the point where Mr John Osselaer himself made fun of me for fighting them over 50 bucks. Once I started looking more into the matter I noticed more and more discrepancies they couldn't explain. It took attorney involvement to get the accounting ""mistakes"" straightened out. No one could tell me ever why any of the fees and fines were put on my account. After looking into my lot file everything after 2015 has been purged from my file. All the alleged violations, their attorney letters, lawsuit settlement... Gone like it never happened. Shady... do not trust them, emails are golden.",0
"This is a new establishment but I can say it was one of the more frustrating experiences for my husband and I. I hate when reviewers comment on the decor first .... But this place is really nothing special. I read the reviews prior - so food reviews were pretty good - and though we should try it. To our dismay we ordered some nigiri - Spanish Mackerel + salmon and a spicy yellowtail maki. Nigiri was a no-go. The quality of the rice was not what we expected, especially for the price point. They should charge much less due to the quality of the fish. There is no denying that his place may do ""okay"" as they have a ton of Maki and Speciality Rolls to offer non-traditionalists. The quality was not there and My advice would be to go to Toyoma if your looking for authentic Japanese sushi in north Scottsdale. I will say the staff and owner were very kind and friendly, and wanted to learn about our experience. Having had the best and some of the worst sushi throughout my years, it's important to keep in mind the quality and price point really have to meet eye to eye. For the price point they offer - I'd go to Toyoma or even Sushi Roku. For quality comparison- I'd go to Teharu on Frank Loyd Wright.",0

"I have never waited less than an hour here to see the doctor for my toddler's appointments. They always say there was an ""emergency,"" but it has been all four times that we have visited. Dr. Bowne performed my son's ear tube replacement when my son was 18 months. The procedure went well. However, it was already his second ear tube surgery (first one performed by a different doctor). My son continues to get ear infections, but they usually clear with the drops. My issue is with the practice as a whole. My son is now three, and the NP just recommended that he have surgery to remove his enlarged tonsils. When I asked why his tonsils were not examined and removed when they performed the ear tube replacement surgery, no one could give me an answer. I continued to call in hopes of speaking to Dr. Bowne or even the NP. However, neither of them could be bothered to return my call. I spoke to the medical assistant multiple times to request an explanation or a phone call from the doctor or NP. However, after ""checking with the NP,"" all the medical assistant could tell me was ""I am not sure why they did not recommend his tonsils to be removed at the same time, MAYBE it was a weight requirement."" When I was unsatisfied with her speculation, she became very rude and told me just to make an appointment to see the doctor. We had just been in a week ago for his appointment! I never received an answer as to why I now have to subject my son to his 3rd ENT surgery at barely 3 years old. Dr. Bowne and the NP refused to offer an explanation or call a concerned parent.",0
"I just want to start with, I'm not going to contact your corporate office in Dallas, Texas. It saves you time from copying and pasting the same generic response to the low-rated reviews. Games and food are overpriced. Although server seemed friendly, my kid's 6$ macaroni was forgotten after already waiting awhile for this food. This macaroni ""meal"" does not come with a side or drink apparently.  The fries that came with our wings were cold. Server also took way too long to bring the check. My dad had to eventually go to the front and tell him to take his card.So, overall, poor service.",0
Horrible! Made an appointment for my boyfriend and I to get pedicures. We showed up 5 min early. We were greeted nicely and sat in a pedi chair quickly. A girl quickly starts to work on my boyfriends pedicure and tells me someone will be with me shortly. Well 55 minutes later boyfriend is done and no one has even acknowledged me. I asked a couple times and got no real response. What happened to ladies first? Or common courtesy? Why make an appointment? I would not recommend this place.,0
I booked ages in advance for a move out cleaning.  The company cancelled with 12 hours before my appointment and left me with no time to book another cleaner... They acted like it was my fault. Their contract said that if I had cancelled within 48 hours of the appointment I would have been billed for part of it... turns out they can cancel right before it and nothing happens... unbelievable.  Would never want to work with a company who does that kind of thing.,0

"There was hair in my food.  There was also hair in the food of another couple that walked out twenty minutes earlier (after announcing the problem quite vocally).  The wait was horrendous.  We weren't the only ones complaining.  The service was awful.  The waitress failed to give us napkins, forks or knives.  We literally had to get up repeatedly to ask for them and actually grabbed the napkins ourselves from a basket on the counter since the waitress rarely came to see about us.  The only thing the server brought quickly was the check after we told her we were leaving after finding hair in the food that we'd waited almost an hour to get!  Yes, we paid for the non-hairy food items (no offer of any discount) and left, never to return again!",0
"Today me and my wife went here before the Indians home opener.  So being that it was busy, we expected to wait a little bit. Well wait a little bit was an understatement.  We waited 20 min to get a table.  It took what appeared to be the only server working about 10 minutes to come greet us if you call walking up and saying ""what do you want"" a greeting.  My wife was a little taken back, she is a server herself and gives the benefit of the doubt, so we ordered our drinks fast and a nachos as an appetizer.  When we got my coke and her bud light in a bottle 10 min after ordering it, we hurried and ordered our food figuring we needed to get our food order in quick and while our server was around.  It took about 45 min to get chicken tenders, fries, and a salad.  We never got the nachos appetizer and when we let our server know this she stated, ""I can put a rush on them"". We politely declined.  The salad came with bacon on it, though the menu did not say it came with bacon.  As well the lettuce looked like they went out back and grabbed the crappiest greens you could find off the nearest bush.  The chicken tenders made McDonald's chicken nuggets look 5 star.  The fries  were soggy and gross.  Disappointed, we hurried and paid and went to the Indians game and got $18 nachos there, but at least we got them.  They knew the Indian's opener would draw a crowd and should of been better staffed. I will say the hostess was busting her butt and was very nice.  The manager never came to our table to ask how our food was, though he had to of walked by 10 times.  In addition,  we watched our server put a dirty tray down on tables that were occupied and pass out drinks to guest at other tables.  She did this with food as well.  And when she refilled my wife's water she sat some other persons ice tea refill down on our table before giving to the proper person.  Just things better run places and servers wouldn't do.  Pretty sad random strangers apologized for coming in after us and were able to get and eat there food and leave before we got ours.  And this stranger was a restaurant manager and said our server was very unorganized and seemed very confused.",0
"Would love to rate zero stars if that were an option. Never in my life have I received such poor service. Not rude, not annoying, just non-existent. Sat at a table patiently for 25 minutes waiting to be acknowledged, offered coffee, ANYTHING really...but the two waitresses who were not even close to being what I would describe as busy went about their morning quite leisurely and made sure to never make eye contact with anyone; always turning their backs to other people in their section who they didn't want to serve at that moment.  My wife's family lives in the area, and after my experience here this morning, I can assure you that none of us will ever come back. I am still shocked that such a place could even be in business.",0
"My son purchased a trek 850 from Jones, cost for bike with tax and accessories, bike lock, lights was $475. He purchased it with his own money that he saved from working after school, to buy a Last week I was running and he was biking. He went over a curb and the weld that makes the wheel round the wheel broke, and the wheel bent over. He brought the bike to the Jones shop. They told him that someone must have run the bike over and that is why the wheel is broke. My son called me and I went down to the shop and asked Travis Jones (the owner) to please show where the bike was run over. After him examining the bike he could not find a mark or any indication that this had happened. (Which it didn't) He told me and my son that the only parts of the trek bike that had a warranty was the frame. Every other part was warranted by the maker of the components and that the wheels had no warranty. He agreed to put in a claim and could call me back on Tuesday or maybe Wednesday at the latest. Today,, I still had not received a call back so I decide to give him a call, He didn't answer so I left a message. He called back 45 minutes later. He acted as though he had no Idea who I was. Finally he said he had not checked on the warranty yet. (So he basically ignored the fact that I was even in the store and didn't follow up with me regarding this issue) He checked while I was on the phone and told me that trek would not warranty this part. He went on to tell me that there was no warranty on the bike again and Jones would not be taking care of this part. Mind you it is a 40 dollar retail part (probable cost to dealer $15). I asked for a phone number to Trek and he told me there was no phone number to call and that I could only email them for help with this. I asked for his sales rep phone number and he refused. Again telling me that the only thing on the bike that was warranted from trek was the frame. Everything else was warranted through the manufacturer of the components and not through trek, and the wheels had 0 warranty. If it broke before we took delivery he would have to eat the repair, but if it broke on the way to the car in the parking lot or the next day, it was our (the customer) responsibility. The manufactures warranty clearly states that these items are covered although not for the lifetime. The components with the shortest warranty are 1 year and that is for the paint and decals. So he is clearly not telling the truth and is not interested in customer service. I would strongly recommend choosing a bike shop other that Jones for purchasing a bike. WE could have paid less and had the bike shipped to us, but we choose to support out local business, but clearly they choose not to support the local customers. Like I said Beware of shops like 2 Week Jones, they say they are about customer service and their warranty, but their actions do not match their words. Beware, $20 dollar tune-ups are nothing compared to having a bike that the bakeshop will not stand behind. Actions speak much louder than words. Stay Away.",0
"I have been with State Farm for nearly 20 yrs.  Although the company as a whole is good, my local agent, Cie Taylor is very unsatisfactory.  So much so that I switched agents recently.  I was usually unable to speak to her when I called, having my questions redirected to a subordinate who usually could not answer my questions.  On the rare occasions when Cie did return my call, I found her aloof, dismissive and arrogant.  There are too many other State Farm agents in the area to tolerate this kind of treatment.

In fact, Rodeway Inn is so bad, it makes me want to go back to my previous 1-star reviews and leave them two stars.I booked this place a few weeks ahead of the ACC football championship. I'm not a picky guy, I can deal with pretty dinky conditions, so long as the place is clean. I picked Rodeway because of its proximity to the stadium and its price. I pull up and immediately I'm turned off. It is so rundown outside, it looks like a crack motel. I'm an Atlanta native, so a little crack doesn't scare me, but this place seriously looks like every bad vision of a crappy hotel rolled into one location. I get into the room, it reeks of cigarette smoke. The toilet is running, the air conditioning unit is dirty. The TV remote doesn't work, and the only way to turn off the TV (which looks itself like a holdover from the first Clinton administration) is by unplugging it. The reception was terrible. There were cigarette burns in the carpet and linens. The box spring was a nasty mess. Luckily, I had an old sheet in my trunk that I use when I take my dogs in the car. Let me restate that: I WOULD RATHER SLEEP ON DOG BEDDING THAN THE LINENS PROVIDED BY THE HOTEL. I put my jacket over the pillow to avoid contact.The shower leaked, so the floor was covered with water after my one shower. I didn't even shower the second day, I was so grossed out. And while I was gone, someone came in and took all of my towels, but didn't replace them or clean the room. There were brown stains on the wall by the toilet....at least I hope they were stains. In the morning, while I was brushing my teeth, I noticed a hair on the mirror. And it was a curly wurly, if you catch my drift. We are well into December, and the swimming pool was filled with gross water. The walls are paper thin, so I was privy to all the goings on in the room next to me all night (they like to party late). There is a wifi connection, but it's open, so I wouldn't really expect any sort of security there.Do not, do not, in the most emphatic way that I can say it, do NOT book this hotel.",0
"I would not recommend this location. When I picked up my dogs they were shaking and not acting like themselves. My small dog who weighs 15lbs, lost 4lbs over a 4 day stay with them. Both of them got very ill and I ended up taking them to the vet, turns out they had kennel cough (pneumonia), which I understand can happen sometimes. When I picked them up it was like they couldn't wait to get me and my dogs out of there. Nobody spoke to me or could tell me anything on how they did during their stay. When I called the first time to just make them aware that the pneumonia might be going around, the girl took down my name and said a manager will call you back, after a week, no call. So I called again and only spoke to a supervisor, she basically argued with me about what kennel cough was and how it's contracted, which I already knew from researching it and spending almost $300 at my vet. Instead of making this right, it was basically like I was shoved aside. Like many, my dogs are like my kids and I felt like they didn't care. I wish I had something better to write, but I'm sorry, my dogs were throwing up and coughing all night when I got them back and it seems that if they, or any other dogs had those symptoms while staying there, they would contact the owners, myself included. There was no accountability from this place when I called and no way they wanted to make it right, just arguing with me, the customer. I will most likely not be returning because I feel I can't trust leaving my dogs somewhere that doesn't want to take the time to even return a phone call.",0
"The mental health care system in the United States is broken! And Redemption Psychiatry is a prime example of this breakdown. From waiting months for an appointment to the complete lack of professionalism in office. Trying to navigate through the process of finding a competent child psychologist has been disheartening, when I was able to actually secure an appointment I was so relieved that this dark journey my family has been on may finally have answers and solutions. My 6 y/o and I met with Dr. Creps...instead of finding compassion and what I was hoping would be a lifeline to ""mental health"" felt more like an interrogation. He sat in front of a computer screen reading from a list of questions, only to look up with what seemed like a look of judgment, when having to answer open and honestly. He had no compassion, no comfort, and gave no input - other than to prescribe medication and hand me a list of counselors....none of which were associated with Redemption??? I voiced my concerns to the front desk and was told the info would be passed along to the office manager. Due to my insurance- I decided to keep my follow up appointment while I was continuing my search for a new doctor. I signed in and waited...and waited...while in the waiting room a got a phone call. It was Redemption! Calling to let me know I had missed my appointment!!! I told them I was sitting in their waiting room. An hour later I had to reschedule my appointment -  Getting to the point to seek a mental health provider is hard enough - this experience has left me feeling so frustrated.  If you have options for another provider I suggest saving yourself the hassle and wasted time and to look elsewhere for services.",0
Their service is terrible! Regardless of how good their food may be if there service isn't good I refuse to go back. I went there a few times to see if maybe it was just that particular day. But their service has always been the same. They take so long to bring your food and if you ask for something else it's like your bothering them. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. There are so many better restaurants with great service and great food! This isn't one of them!,0
"Nice concept, very poorly executed. Only come here if you get the $5 groupon deal, but be warned.  Don't come hungry. 20 minutes from order time to get drinks, they offer refills if you can actually get one. Food took another 35 minutes after drinks arrived. I kept seeing food passing me hoping it was mine so this distracted me from the actual movie. Food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Do yourself a favor and eat before you come.",0
Worst service ever! We were there for 4 hours..food took forever then came out cold. We had to ask 2 different servers to check on our food. The first waiter/server we had was very rude..they must have switched shifts while we were there as suddenly we had a different server. Then a third when it was all said and done. Very disappointed!,0
"Courtney is very rude. Ten minutes prior to closing, she announces ""The registers will shut down in 3 minutes. After this time, no other purchases will be made."" It is 9:58pm and the store is closed. This is no wonder why this location has negative reviews.",0
Get ready to pay for parking! Come on...they foolishly think they can now rip off clients with parking fees like the strip.  I don't slum it to be charged a fee to park.  Good Luck Golden Nugget.  You've lost me as a client.  Ciao!,0
"Stopped in on Monday afternoon. Order taker couldn't answer questions about what was in the kids chicken bowl.  Place was not very clean, the soda area was a wet sticky mess including the floor. The salsa bar looked like it had a fight with itself.  Employees were not that busy that they could not come out and wipe things down. Not a very welcoming experience. Food was good at this location, but the overall was just not there.",0
"The first room they gave us shook so much you could hear the lamps rattling.  It's absurd to think they ever book in that room (I suspect most of that floor feels the same).  After threatening to leave, they moved us up six floors to a room that shook 70% less and gave us a mediocre food comp.       Will never return unless it's the only building standing.",0
"To start off I would literally give this place a ZERO! Time after time I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but they constantly are messing peoples s**t up! One girl refused to operate the drive thru because of the bug infestation around the window. I then decided to come in to get my food which took an additional 15+ minutes. Once they handed me my food the items in the bag were not what I ordered, I told them and they claimed to change it.. Once I got home my order was still messed up.That specific night when I was there I overheard the manager say ""I hate my job"" .. I hate your job too because y'all do a lousy ass job at customer service. Y'all like to complain because y'all do a shitty job. F**k up after f**k up. Close this damn place down immediately!!",0
"The one positive about this place is it is relatively cheap for sushi. But then again, you get what you pay for. None of the plates that I tried we're anything but average.The service here was beyond terrible however. Sometimes people try to attribute that to persons not speaking English as their first language. As an immigrant myself I don't accept that as an excuse. Here they're just rude.The cheap prices don't make up for the meh food as well as terrible service.",0
"Estoy muy molesta ya que a la hora de rentar el carro me dieron un precio por 5 dias, yo lo regrese antes y me cobraron mucho mas de lo q costaba la renta,, creo q es una falta de respeto ya que soy clienta hace mucho tiempo de dollar creo q no es correcto y nadie te ayuda",0
"I'm very unhappy with this priority pass location. Unlike most priority pass clubs, this one closes at 3:30. Now, on the weekends or holidays that wouldn't be unreasonable but The Club turns into a British Airways only lounge after 3:30 so if you aren't flying BA you are out of luck. If priority pass members got a discount--I'd add another star. But it just isn't right that our expensive membership becomes worthless at the early hour of 3:30.",0
"My fiancé and I checked into the emergency room about 5pm, did the self check in and waited, and waited, and waited.  I looked online at the supposed wait time that said 6 minutes.  6 minutes, yeah right.  It was 1.5 hours until he just got triaged.  While he was getting triaged I asked about how long the wait was and the nurse told me there were 20 people ahead of us, some which had been waiting for 5 hours.  But don't worry he told me, it was rumored that in 30 min they were going to open up another section of the hospital for more beds.  I do expect longer wait times at the emergency room but seriously 5 hours before seeing or talking to a doctor.  I know if we ever have another emergency we will NOT be going to summerlin hospital.",0
"Do Not eat in the lounge area and expect service. We have been here once before and had the same experience. The server (young female in boxers) approaches us and asks, ""Hi, are you sitting here?"" ""Are you eating tonight?"" I'll just let those two opening comments speak for themselves. She did manage to create a fantastic comedic memory for all of us at the table. The bathrooms were out of soap, paper towels and the sink area was a wreck. (I let a staff member know)One last thing, my burger was not cooked correctly nor was I asked how I would like my burger cooked. It was a bad night at Holsteins and probably our last time there. Better luck to the rest of you ~",0
So I ho in there as every week and prices went up and I ask why and they said Trumps Tariffs . Then I get home with 15 pants and everyone had double creased. I have ask the previous times about this problem and it got worse. I will be going there one more time and give them one more chance. I'll keep you posted,0
We have tried this place twice now....one when it first opened and again today (7/14/19). The first time is was slow and the food wasn't great and thinking they just opened and they are still working through things we tried it again....okay the hostess was very slow and she didn't see to know what she was doing. There was no one in front of us and we still waited 15 minutes to get a table. The food was cold and one order was wrong. The server was not very nice about the wrong order. When the correct order came out it was cold too. I need to reiterate that everyone's order was cold and they weren't busy. We will definitely not be back!,0
"It is not chicken they are famous for, it's Cornish hen. Chicken is bigger than the Cornish hen. Stop advertising chicken in the menu, it is that of Cornish hen. Very dry chicken but crispy skin. The menu shows larger shrimps, but small shrimps on the Pansit. Will not go back to dine there again.",0
"Got here before 6pm, and didn't get our food until 7:20 pm for a party of 6 and a one year old baby. Thankfully, half the older kids (11, 10)  food came out so it settled them down for the long wait, the baby's food never came because the waiter forgot to add it (he apologized, gave us her meal and didn't charge us for it). During the time waiting for our food, a couple who had been asking for a box that never came, went to empty table to empty table grabbing silverware and used the napkins as a carry out, went to the front to pay yet no one was on the front desk.  About 15 mins after, the adults food and the rest of the kids food came out. We complained about the length of time, asked for the manager, but apparently he was training a new cook. We went ahead and ate our food, hashbrowns were oily, cold, gross, my pancakes were still goo in the center, but I just ate around them instead of waiting another possible hour for new ones. Our waiter had come back, apologized some more (not his fault about the food) and told us the manager had offered us free salad and soup as an apology. We declined, but said thank you anyways. The kids were satisfied with their food, no complaints from them. Our waiter, awesome... Food, meh... experience, fail. Not the first time I've been disappointed with this Dennys.",0
"At $55 admission, $14 beer plus tip and $20 table dance (not a lap dance), this club is already a ripoff. But the private room dance is a real robber. It costs $100 for 15 minutes dance in a dimply lit room. It's not even private as it claims: you sit on a 3-ft wide x 1 ft deep bench with the armrest barely taller than your head separated you from the next customer. Five minutes into the dance, a waitress shows up and tells you to buy minimum two mandatory drinks which cost $20/ea. Neither the dancer or the bouncer at the room entrance told you that before you got in. You already paid $100 before being allowed to enter the room and cannot back out. All the pretty girls already have their familiar sugar daddies whom they stick to the whole time leaving only the average one to dance on the stage. Nah, I've seen better dancers, better service, better price. Just not here.",0
"Hakka legend is my most favourite hakka Chinese restaurant in GTA. I am a regular but at a different location. It's a shame this location doesn't live up to the committed taste. I will try and sugarcoat my words here as much as I can. The most terrible experience I've ever had. Unprofessional and rude staff. Even the Manager doesn't give a shit. He will act like he cares but if he really did it would show in his gesture or in the service next time. Never ever work to make the customers happy. Just slammed the water on our table. Not even once I've asked if my food taste okay. Where do you think you guys are runnimg this restaurant? Hellloooo it's Canada. Doesn't hold even one quality of the Canadian Customerservice culture here. Experience here always makes me crawl out of skin. Whenever a concern is raised regarding the taste or quantity of the dish they just nodded and walked away saying they can't do anything about it. NEVER tried to fix it. We've been here now 5 times and came out unhappy every single time. One thing we always feel is they don't care if you're a unhappy customer as they're anyway getting the crowd by the name itself. I've overheard so many customers complain about the food. Try giving a feedback or ask them to make some change in their crappy food and you'll see what I mean. When one goes to a chain they expect to receive the same/similar experience. Go to Markham/Scarborough location from the exact same menu, order any item and it's comes out the same. However here it looks completely different. They made us pay for something that should have been already included in the dish. I'll be happy if I could save one Customer from having a terrible experience n would stop going here after reading this review. You'll understand why I'm so upset with this location only if you've been to other locations of Hakka Legend. For anyone who needs proofs, pictures and videos of the same dish ordered at Mississauga and Markham that doesn't even look same hit me up.Long story short- These guys need to listen and act to the customers feedback. Also pull your team together and arrive to one recipe for all locations. And stop hiring ""JERKS""",0
"I'm not one to leave bad reviews, but my experience was that horrible. Never ever will I support or visit this store again. Their customer support and upper management are horrible and treat their customers like crap. They would not release a product to me that I had purchased online for my daughters birthday and I have (and had) the confirmation to pick it up and also talked about me behind my back- I guess they didn't realize I was standing right behind theirs. I've always been a huge target fan and supporter-but I've lost a lot of respect for them tonight. Even after showing them the tracking confirmation and screen that said my order is ready to pick up at their location, their store managers exact words were ""I can not go by what your screen says (and the target website), I can only by what mine says."" Out of respect I won't  disclose any names.",0
"On September 13, 2014 we went to this IHOP again. We were seated and given menus but after that we were completely ignored. The server never did come back to take our order and after about 15 minutes of waiting we got up and left the restaurant, unable to even order our food.Extremely poor service.",0
"This place is a scam that preys on housewives and old people. I went in because I was fairly certain my power steering was broken. They called me a few hours later and asked ""Did you hit something really hard with your car?"" Of course I didn't but they were lubing me up to tell me that I needed a new suspension. They also tried to tell me my gasket heading were leaking or something. The total bill for fixing these problems was $2800. I said no and took it to Eurowise off old Pineville rd where I was told that my gasket headings were fine, as was my suspension but that my power steering was broken and it would cost me about $300 to fix. This AAA is a total scam.",0
"All customers getting pedicures. I asked for gel nails. I was being discouraged from nails, immediately, and told I needed to have brought my own polish. NO THANKS!!!!",0
The WORST service!!!! We ordered our food at 1:52pm! It's now 3:47pm and our food STILL is not here!!! We have called twice to check the status and was told both times that the driver was around the corner! So CLEARLY he's not around the corner!!! I'm SO freaking irritated.... I will NEVER order from them again!,0
"I should have known two years ago when I was told at my initial consult that ""I was a great candidate. My tattoo is black, small, and in an area that has no sun exposure- 10 sessions will be perfect"" that it was too good to be true. I finished my 10th session, and suprise- they told me I need 10 more. I get that they can't know 100% how your body will respond- I anticipated needing a few more sessions, but to be told I need double what I was told initially makes me think this place is a scam. They of course, tried to ""give me a good deal"" on another package, which was exactly what I bought the initial package for. I'll be going to a different place to wrap this thing up, and will continue to warn as many people that I can about their tactics. By the way, they conveniently delete any negative comments made on social media about the subject.  I'm so disappointed with this place. Buyer beware!",0
"Tremendous fun if you have a table. If not, you're gonna get squished and have a tough time getting around. It's a huge place, but being the hot spot, they pack it in. I think there are places just as fun out there that can offer you a bit more space. Good music and crowd though, so people keep going back...I would too.Went back May 08 with a reservation for a table. 3 bottle minimum and good balance of guys/girls. Couldn't even get in once we were there. Bouncers were actually asking for $ just to have the pleasure of paying them for 3 bottles. Supposedly a large group of guys got the opportunity by paying 2K, before paying for the bottles. Good for them I guess. Better places around.",0
"Food was decent and no different than any other ihop location,  the service on the other hand was absolutely horrible! Our waiter barely ever spoke, he mostly just awkwardly stood there and stared at us, and the rare occasions when he did speak it was extremely robotic and scripted. We waited forever to receive refills on our drinks. When our food came out he dropped the bill with it and NEVER stopped back by our table. When we stopped by the counter to pay we waited for a good 5 minutes before our server came over to check us out and he again didn't say a word. Just stood there and stared at us. It was a very uncomfortable and terrible visit and I will not be returning.",0
"This location is quite terrible. There is no line to form and place your order. Customers are lined up in one and there are three cashiers open, you'll experience much unnecessary confusion. The store manager should let the employees know how to manage a line up especially in a busy mall location, they should be trained better to serve higher volume. (All is takes is one staff to tell customers where the line ups are formed). Even though it depends, the orders tend to come in reasonable time but again, expect to experience some sort of mix up with other people's order till you finally get yours. Now that I know there are other coffee shops around (Starbucks, Aroma, etc), I'd avoid McDonald's.",0
I wish I could give this more stars because the service and staff were so good.  But the Friday fish fry was one of the worst I have ever had.  The walleye was paper thin and tasted like bland breaded cardboard.  It was way over cooked and dry and hard.   It was a good thing we were with someone else so we could at least enjoy the company.  The restaurant had at least an hour wait and I wish I would have left.  But I thought all these people could not be wrong.  I was the wrong one for sure    The free popcorn was good.,0
We had dad here for rehab again.  The leadership is not as solid as it was at our last stay.   We've been getting a lot of closed doors and told what providers to use when my dad goes home.  We've used the same companies for years.   Call lights are never answered.  My dad had to wait over two hours for his pain meds. No one answered the call light on several occasions until sometimes 30-60 mins later.  NOT WHAT WE EXPERIENCED BEFORE!,0
"Worst fast food experience ever! 1. The drive thru took 25 minutes! That isn't fast food!2.  We ordered no sour cream on anything... Everything had sour cream on it.3.  We ordered 10 total items including 2 big BOX meals. ALL 10 items were stuffed into 1 small bag with all the sauce packets and napkins.  Everything was squished, soggy and cracked.  Why is it advertised as box, yet they put it all into a tiny bag? We won't be going back to this location.  It was a waste of $18.",0
"Let me start by saying that I used to love this place. It is bright, airy and the staff is very nice. We were always taken care of, and food came out promptly and was decent enough. But the last time I was there (two Saturdays ago), I don't know what happened. The place was a complete disaster, an utter chaotic mess. I met my friend for brunch at 11 am. He was seated at the bar, where we were planning on having our meal. The bar is small and there were two to three people behind it at all times, yet it still took a bartender at least 10 minutes to greet me and ask me for my beverage order (including my friend and me, there were five guests at the bar). I ordered an iced tea, and we asked for a some menus so we could order. (As a former bartender, you want to offer your guests menus, try to build your clientele, get some regulars, so this was not impressive service.) After about 5 more minutes we had to wave down the bartender to give her our orders. We watched her write them down, punch the touch screen on the bar computer, and still 45 minutes later, we still had no food. She never talked to us, never ran back to the kitchen to check on anything, nor did she get a manager involved. The other three people at the bar came in at the same time as us, and were served in a timely manner. Normally, we would not wait that long for food, but we set a leave time for 12:15 PM and just sort of watched the chaos of the restaurant to see how things would pan out. What we noticed was an overstaffed, poorly managed restaurant. We watched a couple other tables complain to management about long wait times (one guy had waited an hour for his food). Finally 12:15 rolled around. Still no food. We gave some other girl behind the bar $5 for the tea, told her we were not waiting any longer and left. She looked like she had heard that from her guests before. I left feeling like I just walked out of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.",0
"I just bought the Madeleine, no taste at all. It's just an ordinary bake flour and sugar. I am soo disappointed. My muffin cake taste better than theirs.  Never buy here anymore.",0
"I recently took both my car and my wife's car to this location for service.  The check engine light came on in my wife's car because the vacuum tubes had been dislodged during the air filter replacement and improperly re-attached.  I am not the most car savoy person, but I was able to detect the issue and fix it putting the hoses in the correct orientation.  My car would only start about 50% of the time and my battery is less than 6 months old.  I opened up the hood of my car to find that the negative wire terminal on my battery was loose.  This could have been stupidity or fishing for more money to work on my car.  Needless to say for either reason I will not be going back.",0
"Food was very bland and mushy.  I sat by the service area where I saw one of the cooks (who was filthy, and covered in sweat), make 3 trips to the bathroom.  I hope he washed his hands!!Overall, not a good Mexican place.",0
"This was my first visit and my last. Received a gel manicure from an employee with no name tag so I don't know her name. Where to start, upon check in was not told how long the wait would be. We were just sat down and abandoned. They used several stall tactics to make sure we were stuck there. I knew I should have left right then and there, not sure why I do this. When we finally got helped there was a sense of confusion of my services and the employee began filing her own sharp thumb daggers and said, I need to sharpen these because clients say they are too sharp! Seriously sharping and filing during my service is unacceptable. Just an FYI the thumbs nails she has, need to be cut down!!! She cut into me the entire service!! Additionally, she cut into my cuticle and made them bleed on at least 4 of them. She continued to file down my nails beyond short. Yes I agreed to making my nails even; however not to file to the skin and bone!!! Seriously to the skin. She took over an hour and half just trying to file my nails and remove gel mishaps onto my skin. She picked my skin where the gel had set and dismissed my wincing. If you want to come home with hands that feel like someone rub sand paper on you go ahead. Oh and she micromanaged me on what I could and couldn't do regarding using a towel and putting my hand in the gel light. There Is so much more but you tAgain, first time experience. Wow horrified. Won't be back. ----------------------------------------This is a Reply to the owner's reply-Let me state the facts on my visit.1- I do not have a Son.2- I never used your bathroom.3- your employee filed her nails in front of me during my service. She has very long thumb nails that are pointed and should be cut as this was very painful as she used them for cleaning up nail polish on my skin. Thank you for your response and hope that you continue to work with your employees as these services should match the prices and quality of work.",0
"Steve quoted me $2,800 for my engine rebuild and that included break in & a dyno run to show me how much horsepower my motor would make.  He said he could install my new fuel injection system and it would be ready in three weeks.  Once he got the motor, he raised the price to $3,200, didn't know how to install the efi system, and couldn't do a pull on the dyno because something was wrong with his equipment.  Three months (not weeks) later, I had my engine.  He threw away my header gaskets, lost my brand new lift plate, and kept the fuel pump block-off which caused oil to leak out of the motor and all over my truck bed and garage floor.  The shop is a filthy, disorganized, cigarette smoky mess with engine blocks and crank shafts EVERYWHERE.  He won't call you when your engine is ready; you have to chase him every week and remind him which engine is yours.  The receipt is printed on a dot matrix printer, if that gives you an idea of how antiquated this place is.",0
"In all my years of renting in various places, never have I ever had the security deposit basically taken away from me, but expect to get billed another additional $150-200 after move out. Bunch of crooks running this company. Even the maintenence man said that they will charge you for a cleaning+carpet fee regardless if you clean it yourself....",0
"Very disappointed with the ""New and Improved"" GameWorks. I do understand it is a smaller location from there last, but its so cramped in there. Usually lines for arcades that dont even work right. Over-priced. Just not a place where I would spend my day with friends.",0
"This company is a SCAM!!! Beware EVERYONE!!! I had such bad experiences from them and I should do my homework first. Craig was the guy who said $1200 total for a repair on my washer machine?? Was he that stupid? Yes again, LG referred them to me. So he tried to correct this situation by calling LG to cover the motor which is still under warranty. He told me now I'd still have to pay $600 +? I called LG and they said no one had contacted them yet? Yes, it was a SCAM alright!!! Please don't fall into this trap like I did. Yes I finally bought a new LG washer model for less than $900 rather than letting them have any more of my hard working money. Buy-Rite Appliance should be Buy-Wrong Appliance!!!!!!!!",0
"If you're on a diet and want over priced food this is the place for you. I've been to other locations and they have always managed to pack our to-go containers FULL (they could barely stay closed). But this location (from my experience) doesn't pack nearly as much entrees as the other locations. They do pack a lot of rice and noodles, but as far as entrees are concerned, they fail. I come to this location at least once a month (it's more like 3-4 times a month) and have only received good service once. If you like their food, go to another location because I'm sure they give more entrees than this place does. I only come here because it's convenient for me. It's less than a mile from my house but the next location is several miles away.",0
"I've ordered from this location several times because it's close to my work. There's been a sharp decline in service. A few months ago I ordered and accidentally gave them the wrong address. Totally my bad. The driver called, I apologized profusely, his entire delay was maybe 10 minutes and I grabbed an extra ten from my purse to compensate him for his time and trouble. When he arrived, he began screaming and yelling at me, calling me ""stupid"" in front of an office full of coworkers. I totally get being frustrated, I screwed up. I don't understand screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs because someone reversed a couple of numbers while typing in an address. It was unprofessional and upsetting. Today I ordered pizza to arrive at a certain time and it was nearly an hour late. I also found out that they no longer give complimentary parmesan and red chilis, but that they will sell them to you. Huh? Kinda over Domino's, especially this location. Wish I could order online from another store. I just don't think these guys care about getting it right.",0
"***EDIT 2/10***The owner reached out to me to ask who our server was to ""address the issue."" Quite frankly they should address the issue that is themselves. I did not appreciate that they would want to throw their own staff under the bus when I called them out on inflating their yelp reviews. AVOID. The owner has found a way to cleverly inflate their yelp reviews. They spend their advertising budget on their staff; by offering a Disneyland trip to the server with the most 5 star reviews. This is clearly a great way for the staff to solicit 5 star reviews based on service and not food. Sorry, but I'd rather have great food and shitty service than shitty food and awesome service. When the metric is based of names in 5 star yelp reviews, how do you expect your servers to not solicit reviews? Or even mention it? ***This place has falsely inflated yelp reviews. I got duped into checking this place out and the food was no different from any other typical American diner breakfast places. Why such a low review? Food was mediocre. Ordered the avocado and chicken egg white omelet and it wasn't very memorable. The potatoes are generously covered in what was very similar to Lawry's seasoning salt. Also had the country fried steak skillet. The sausage gravy was good; aside from that I was not impressed with the food. The over easy egg was sitting in a puddle of grease and the egg white portions were rubbery. Our server was patient and great and we got free banana muffins upon yelp check in. At the end of our visit, our server asked us for a 5 star review and asked for us to write her name in the review. Apparently the owner of this place will gift a trip to Disneyland to the server who convinces the most guests to write 5 star reviews. Hmmmmmmmmmmm.....This totally works against what Yelp is for. A consolidation of reviews and ratings; this place does NOT have a 4.5 star rating for its food. I would consider it a 3 star place AT BEST. If it was correctly rated, I wouldn't have wasted stomach space and a meal at this restaurant. If you don't believe me, take the time and read through the various reviews; you'll notice that majority of them will reference a server name, some of them talk about Disney or Disneyland trips. Frankly a restaurant smack out in Las Vegas should not have any references to Disney or Disneyland trips unless they were serving up Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes. AVOID. (Unless you're a local and have plenty of opportunities to eat around Vegas and don't care for a wasted meal)",0
"The fries were so salty we couldn't even eat them.  We sent them back and the next batch were just as bad and didn't eat them.    The coffee was good but not hot enough. My GF wanted another cup of coffee so I ordered a second one but when I went to pay with my credit card they said they had a $5 minimum on card purchases.  I had just spent $18 on coffee, fries and beignets and after sending the fries back I would have thought they'd either run the card for the $3.26 or give us a complimentary cup of coffee.   We love to patronize mom and pop places but they need to differentiate themselves with customer service and empower their employees to serve their customers.    I will not be coming back here.  They need to think outside the box.",0
"Keep moving because this is the worst range I've ever been to in the Charlotte area. If you can deal with high prices, poor shooting facilities topped off with a sadistic staff and owner then you're a far more tolerant person than me.",0
"Huge portions for mediocre food, that's really all I have to say. I've been there a couple times and it's just a little puke worthy if you eat one of their burgers and fries.",0
"I wound up with a Groupon for this place and was excited to go for a burger. I gotta say, it just was not doing it for me, even for half price. The burgers are not that good and the fries were simply bad. I would pass on this place.",0
"Seriously, the specialty drinks at this place is very plain, nothing special at all. Even though the drink is on promotion, I still don't think it is worth the price. The variety of drinks in this place is relatively less than other bbt store. The food I order tasted worst than a neighbourhood snack store and waited for almost half hour which is unacceptable.",0
"Red Velvet Pancakes here are my favorite thing on earth.....what sucks is that I work at a nightclub & will never be able to make it here before 2pm when they close.I got up at 1 today- soooo excited to eat here, walked in at 1:40 & they told me they were closing in 10 minutes, so I had to order to go. Extremely disappointed. Had to eat at cappriottis instea",0
"I've been here three times and each time I tell myself I'm not going to bother coming back...I've had the Caesar Salad before, BAD.Today I had the wildflower salad.  It was so blah and small.  Especially for the high prices.There's always a long wait to order and an even longer wait for the food to come out.  I don't know why I bother coming back.",0
The only thing consistent about this place is how often they get my take out order wrong. I've given it lots of tries because I used to live within walking distance and it has mostly ended in regret.   The ambience when dining in feels like an arcade more than a restaurant and trying to have a conversation inside is a nightmare.,0
"Do not go to this location. I am a Cafe Rio addict and have been going for almost 15 years. I live down the street from this place and drive to a different location. My mind is blown that EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I go to this location in person, or call in an order ahead, it's always messed up or not there. Always. A one entree order? Botched. A large to go order? Not even sure if it's ours. A large catering order to go? Missing. I guess I'm the real idiot for coming back. My husband recently picked up a huge order for my  sons birthday. He stood there looking at it, while they just weren't sure of the spelling on the name so they kept telling him they didn't have the order. What?! I'm only writing this to save you the frustration, and hopefully this location sees this. I'm not sure where the problem lies Bc at this point it's just an issue of competence, but it would sure be convenient for me to come here instead of driving to a diff place.",0
"Hit the horrible service trifecta. Place is crazy busy. Our server, Melissa J, is super rude and snotty. Bailey asked for a plain bacon cheeseburger- she told him to look at the menu because they don't come plain and for him to tell her item by item what he DIDN'T WANT on his burger. What part of plain is so hard. I looked at her and said ""plain"" meat cheese and bacon. Got another snotty comment. Now I know why I hate this place. Thought I would give it another chance, figured a couple of years gave them enough time to get their crap together. guess not!Server should thank her lucky stars she doesn't work for me - cuz she would be on the street quicker that you can say fired!Server heard the kids talking about me writing the monster of a bad review, so she stood around when his burger was delivered and asked if it was plain enough! Seriously!",0
Ive been here before and Robert did an amazing job but I just got home from being there for 3 hours to have my nails already chipped and super thin. I don't remember her name but she is new and was african American. Very disappointed and I will be back tomorrow to have somebody fix them.  She also did not paint my whole nail either and filed them horrible never going back!,0
"Poor service and the waiter is rude. We order only 3 foods, but the lady who is working over there, bring us 4 bowls of Wonton Soup. The soup wasn't have any flavor at all.",0
Food is amazing fast service great customer service. I have it one star because they seem to only hire non white people. In today's world these racist hiring practices shouldn't be tolerated. You should have one person of every race to be fair. Shame on you canes for being anti white.,0
"If you like Fox News, news used loosely, you'll like this place if you don't care about, over priced bad food or service. Ordered a skillet breakfast came on two plates. That's not a skillet. Would not recommend this place and don't plan on going back.Enjoy!",0
"I've been here before for oil changes and always left happy! However, they gave me a quote for my brakes to be replaced and changed the price when I returned. The first quote included replacement of a serpentine belt and front brakes for $220. I returned and they ended up telling me a different price of $487. I returned home to my usually mechanic from college and only paid $50 for brakes and a belt. Let alone, my rear brakes were great after they had told me they were bad. I'm not an expert at vehicles but there is no way a 45 minute job of front brakes and a serpentine belt would cost almost $500. Excluding rotors. I was happy to drive back home for 2 hours and have everything done for less than $100. In total my uncle was able to do the brakes and replace the belt in under an hour. They also failed to let me know that I had a couple wires rubbing up against the belt which is absolutely dangerous. Sorry but I will not be returning.",0
"We were patients of both Dr Vesna and her husband, Dr Petar, Jamborcic for several years and were satisfied.  Then Dr Petar misdiagnosed a hernia problem on my husband, which later resulted in a rupture and major infection.  Then, without going into details, Dr Vesna violated patient confidentiality.  She also would leave the room while seeing us and we later found out she was calling other doctors for info and would come back in and present the info as her own knowledge.  So we left and are now seeing another doctor we trust.",0
"Had reservations for a Birthday of 15 people last night for 10:30pm! Upon our arrival we requested our table and was turned down. Management indicated that the call made could have been a prank therefore they never reserved our table. Due to the number we had and the distance from where the guests were traveling, we called ahead the day of (7pm) to ensure our reservations were in place, in which the gentleman on the phone reassured us all was good. Upon our arrival, the ""manager/owner"" refused to make room for us no hospitality what so ever. Was told well that's to bad, if you don't like it leave and practicly kicked us all out due to there mistake. Restassured, we were able to get a table at another shisha place down the street and they were very accommodating on such short notice. WORSE PLACE EVER WOULD NEVER CONSIDER GOING BACK AND NEITHER WILL THE GROUP OF 15.",0
Went here for a bad back and was sorely disappointed. The owner refused to shake my hand and was a complete ass. I would never recommend this place to anyone.,0
Arrived at 820.  Drove here specifically.  Entire place is shut down. Asked the guy locking up if hlmy hours were wrong. Said if was slow so he closed up.Dont post hours if you cant adhere to them.  Wasted a ton on my time.  New business? Even subway stays open during posted hours,0
"Terrible experience, the service was extremely rude and their open bar is very misleading. At the entrance they gave me instructions to get to the open bar and when I got there they poured me a drink and then forced me to pay full price for it, saying that the ""other bar"" was the open one. Classic bait and switch.",0
Took the money and didn't come out. Pool was not swept. Have no idea if this joker even visited during the summer we were gone. Recommended that you go with someone else. These people are less than truthful.,0
"I love Panda Express, except for this location in 51st Ave & Baseline - poor service plus the portions gets smaller and smaller. I love the Panda Express on 24th Street & Baseline.",0
Terrible customer service. Only one person who works there is helpful not sure of her name.,0
"I'm sorry but this place is not good.  We thought the idea of revolving sushi would be fun.  It was the exact opposite.  First, when we walked in we were the only people in there.  Second, the sushi belt was full of sushi that probably had not been touched in awhile.  That made us nervous.  Finally when we did decide to order something off the menu, the manager lady said, ""Oh that's ok but you need to try the tempura roll.""  My sister and I looked at each other because we thought it was a little strange that she was trying to talk us out of what we had just ordered off the menu, but we took her advise.  We saw her walk up where the sushi bar was and pull off the roll that she insisted we try off of the conveyor belt.  That's when the light bulb went off.  She was trying to get rid of the sushi on the factory line rather than making something fresh.  We will never go back.  There are too many other great sushi places in the Valley that deserve our business.  This is not one of them.",0
"I really liked this place a lot. Yet when care gets complicated here, meaning a more challenging case, I have not been thrilled with management.My 1 1/2 years old Persian cat started having discharge from her right eye, was pawing at it, and something just wasn't right. The veterinarian looked and said she saw nothing. I took my cat back again about a month and a half later, as she was developing a black spot on her right eye. The veterinarian did a slit lamp exam and gave her an antibiotic and recommended an ophthalmologist, which I also asked for. The problem was that she said that it was not an emergency. When I called the ophthalmologist to make an appointment, they were about 4 to 5 weeks out. I said OK and made the appointment. I watched my cat's eyes slowly worsen over that time despite an antibiotic. It turned out that she had herpes Simplex keratitis, which can become very serious and very damaging to the eye if not treated early. The antibiotic given does not treat herpes, which cats are easily prone to. She never told me about what this condition can do to the eye and never gave me proper informed consent. What she should have said is get to the ophthalmologist right away. My cat needed surgery and it was major surgery of both eyes. By the time she got to the ophthalmologist, it was advanced in the R eye and it had now also affected the left eye. The procedure cost $6000 yet that was not the concern. The concern was the suffering that my cat had to go through. I initially was very upset and requested to see all of the medical records as I was seriously considering writing a complaint to the veterinary board. I chose not to do that because I too am in the healthcare field and understand that mistakes can be made. Still, informed consent should always be given and it failed in this case. I would have probably given this review two or three stars, but it gets one star for the following reason: you should seriously ask to read the charts because you never know what they were put in there. In November 2017, my cats had appointments and I brought all three in. I was there on time and the front desk receptionist was extremely rude. She did not look up at me or acknowledge me or apologize for anything, while giving me dirty looks and rolling her eyes. I finally simply asked to speak to the manager and asked if we could be put in a room and that was the extent of the conversation. No yelling. Sadly for this young woman, I had witnesses with me that day. So, imagine my shock when I'm reading the medical record and this woman, who I am now told by the owner was fired and no longer works there, put in a note claiming that I was rude to her and yelled at her but she apologized to me and that I was also rude to other clients in the clinic... What??? 1) I never made any contact with other customers/clients there nor spoke with them. 2) she claimed that I yelled at her and that she apologized to me? I wish that would've happened because I would have felt bad and apologized, but instead I actually kept a low voice and was taken aback by how inappropriate she was towards me. 3) she lied and put in a demeaning and derogatory paragraph about me and it was under the veterinary doctors note in the medical chart! Being in the healthcare field, that is an absolute no no. You can email a bad interaction to your boss or manager, but unless that bad interaction is between the actual nurse/veterinarian and the patient, in the examination room during the visit, it should never be documented in the medical chart. Not only was it false documentation in a medical chart, but it was false documentation made up that never happened and my friends, who were witnesses, wanted me to consider getting a lawyer because of this. I am not going to sue and I'm not going to anything... I am so disgusted at this point that I just don't plan on going back.I have spoken to many friends and none of them take their pets to this clinic, and now neither will I. Very disappointed. I really believed and thought this was a top notch place. They are good for dental cleaning and they're great for preventive. I find that when cases get complicated past that, I have not been happy with outcomes and decisions. I will be taking the care of my cats elsewhere to a clinic that all my friends are highly recommending.",0
"I was a regular here.  Service depends on who you get, it could be decent or it could be horrible.  One time I came here they were out of hot water and I was never offered a discount.  Yesterday I made an appointment for 10am today, only to show up and was told to come back in an hour.  Never coming back.",0
Charlie's bar in PHX used to be the goto bar for country western dancing and cruising the Cowboys. Different days and clientele. All Charlie's have been known for Cowboys. Not so much anymore. (Like every techno bar). Bartenders are nice enough. Never in a hurry though. Probably a good place to drink if your just bored. Many bars in this area of PHX. That actually like to serve. I guess John King (the owner). Has not been here for awhile. I don't think he'd let his iconic bars allow this.,0
"This is the worst place to go and try to rent from. Such an unpleasant and unprofessional woman named Marie in the office! She was unapproachable and rude to me on the phone when I was on my way there, also she dismissed me a couple of times on different occasions. As we did the tour she let me know what a shithole this complex is, and how she's lived here and has had nothing but problems. It got to the point where it was way to personal for me, when all I wanted was information on renting an apartment. Thanks but no thanks",0
"Not impressed. Hole in the wall establishments are my all time fave, this place however.... Nope. Beans were reheated and you could taste it. Chilaquiles were salty. Soda was flat. Yelp disappointed me with this one.",0
"My RO unit is up for maintenance. I called to see about how much to change my filters. It is $150 for the service call and $256 in parts. For filters only, if they find anything else that needs done, that is extra. So over $400 just to change out filters.  A new unit at the hardware store is between  $250- $350. And I can switch out my own filters for a fraction of the cost. Wish I never wasted my money on this company.",0
"Ugh. That was truly awful. I'll upload a picture of my manicure. It was not a clean location, and the technician kept looking over his shoulder to watch the TV. He was really nice, but I left with uneven nails, horrible cuticles, and a very sloppy manicure. Not so super!",0
"I needed some work on two pairs of pants purchased recently and my wife needed an alteration on one of her dresses. I called and talked to the gentleman, who is the owner i believe, and he told me prices and options and asked about when do we need these pieces of clothing, etc.Everything was great, I had my pants done, no problem. The wife had a different experience with the lady owner. Not only was she rude in her approach, but the price range discussed on the phone was nowhere near what she stated in the store. Money is not a problem because it wasn't a fortune, but her negative attitude and lack of class is. To be clear, the one star is for the lady and not for the gentleman, who was more than polite and kind. It's not necessary for this kind of behavior and more than anything, it's not going to make people come back.",0
"Was just in Vegas with the boys and looking to have fun. Heard XS was the best in Vegas other then TAO. Guys, if you want to have fun do not go to this place. It's a beautiful spot to be for a first timer to just experience. On a Sat night, this place was packed. I mean, you cant move, cant talk to a girl, cant even dance. The girls are Hott, mostly Asian which I luv, but they are just there to show off and nothing more. I feel like the LA girls were all at XS. I would say 85% of people who go to Vegas are CALI people. Or else Vegas strip would be a ghost town. The bouncers let everyone in, just go early if your a guy. So guys, if you are trying to talk to girls, dance with them, and get to know them, you can kiss that goodbye. Its PACKED dance floor. You cant even move. But if your trying to go check out the scene, its beautiful. Next time I go to Vegas, I am trying off the strip clubs to see real vegas girls.",0
Stayed there over the 2015 Memorial Day weekend. Everything was going good until they hit me with a smoking fee? Yes there were cigarette packs there but none were smoked in the hotel during the weekend. Supposedly they did a smoke test when we left and found something? I have no idea what kind of test they did because nothing was smoked in the room. I called trying to get it waved but they can't? I would love to see the test results because this is just a bogus claim.,0
If you don't mind being served pizza by a girl chewing on a toothpick and picking her teeth go here! That was the most disgusting thing I've seen in awhile! I wouldn't ask for a napkin on the way by let alone spend any $$.,0
"This place is completely disgusting! Just took our first walk through of our ""new"" apartment and already found 15 roaches! This is by far worst than any apartment or even motel I have ever seen. It hasnt been worked on, definitely has not been clear of their cockroach  infestation! If I could rate this place zero stars I would. Also, all you hear in the leasing office is complaints about people's air being out for 3 or more days, not hours, DAYS. This is by far the worst apartment I have ever been too. They show you the model at first, but they don't actual let you see the actual apartment you're getting until you've signed the lease.",0
"Please beware of this hotel! Do not waste your money or your time! They have the WORST customer service that I have ever experienced! Starting  with check-in, room service and housekeeping! And don't waste your time voicing your concerns to management because they simply don't care! I visit Las Vegas twice a year and have never experienced such poor service! I will never stay here again! I don't usually write reviews, however,  I felt compelled to warn others who might consider staying here! 1)asked for an upgrade. Said there was none but online plenty of rooms. 2)regular room so tiny. Feels claustrophobic. 3)does not treat military well, even though Total Rewards is a supporter of military. 4)room was dirty when checked in! Other people's trash still in room! 5)did not want room service, housekeeping would not leave towels! Said we had to call for some. We asked how she was going to clean room without leaning towels. Housekeeper said, ""you want me to clean your room or not?!"" ....Really?! Never been treated like this.",0
"Let me begin with...When I had first called to place my pick up order the lady that answered changed her tone of voice with me after I said I would like to place an order to go. She says Ooookay, can you hold? I said yes and BAM she hangs up! Lol. I knew I should have ran then. I decide to call back and she doesn't even apologize for hanging up on me she simply says what can I get you. As if she was hoping I would shoo away. My order was simple, large coke, chicken fettuccini and a salad. I show up to pick up my order and leave my fault for not double checking. My fettuccini was plain to chicken.. They dont have LARGE sodas to go so dont ask lol. And I was given no utensils. I am not headed home and planned on eating on the way. What a lame sauce experience. Will not return. If i could give this place zero stars I would. C ya",0
"Horrible horrible. Stay away.It took 50 minutes for my friend's salad wrap.  What salad takes 50 minutes.  They brought me a dry burnt burger after 30 minutes.  It will only be a few minutes... Our waitress lied or the kitchen quit.Never again.  Stay away.Ps.  Thanks for never refilling my waterTook another 20 minutes to get our bill.  I talked to the manager and she said, I am not your server.  I just want to leave... ring me up get me out of this horrible place.  Another table walked out because the trouble.",0
This airline is lame. Got to my gate just a few min late on Mother's Day because their last flight got delayed and wouldn't let me in. And the plane was out there for at least 20 min as I was watching them. They didn't seem to care or nothing. Just said sorry issued me another ticket for the next flight which wasn't for another 8 hours.  I'm glad there are other airlines out there now traveling to Hawaii instead of them monopolizing and taking advantage of people.,0
Horrible Chicken tasted like it was microwaved after being reheated.   Crumbled in your mouthI love chicken teriyaki.   Couldn't eat more than one bite.  Don't recommmend,0
Bought a Groupon for this site but when I called to make an appt they tell me all the stylists have an up charge for the service. So the one she wanted to book me with had a$35 up charge on top of the Groupon. Talk about false advertising. Your think you are getting a deal but in the end you are not. Buyer beware!!!!!!,0
We ordered food online and they said they never got the order when we arrived to pick it up because their phone was dead and their office needed to call it into them after it was placed online. We then had to wait another 35 minutes for the order for a total 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time of the order. They made no offer to compensate for their mistake and our time. Didn't even offer a water for the wait. Very disappointing management and customer service. Will not return.,0
"Yuck. Tastes like it is from the kitchen of an immigrate who can only afford Walmart cans of processed ingredients that have been refrozen a dozen times. Better food at Taco Bell, and cheaper.",0
"Regrettably, the service at this restaurant is so repeatedly terrible that I've finally come to write a poor review. The most recent occurrence happened today when I wanted simply to order takeout. I called and was put on hold for 20 minutes. When someone picked up, I tried to order pasta, al dente. The staff advised that she doesn't know what al dente means; I tried to explain what I was looking for, and she responded that she still doesn't know and, before I could respond, said she was going to ask someone and put me on hold yet again. After 15 minutes, I hung up and had to call in again. For a restaurant with subpar food, the service should at least be decent. Over time, I've only resorted to ordering from this restaurant as a last resort. I regret to say that I'll no longer order from here.",0
"Dr.Allen is great! And everyone else on the team is warm friendly and wonderful.However one lady in particular at the front desk is HORRIBLE!!!!!!! Her name is Joanna Davis. She always has wrong information, bitchy attitude, threatens to over charge you and not give you a doctors note when needed. When your sick this is the last thing you want to experience. Twice I have left and driven somewhere else to receive care because she was there. If she hates her job so much she should NOT be working in Health Care of all places....Simply Horrible experience The only reason I continue to go there is because the rest of the docs and nursing staff and secretaries are wonderful.Joanna Davis should be Fired.",0
"Went there for dinner and waited 20 minutes to be seated. After about 15 minutes the server took our order then waited one hour, we gave up waiting and said goodbye",0
"On my search of super spicy foods, I just had to enter this place.  Pepper Chili, how can a name sound spicier?At first glance, the place looked old and crummy and I knew I should have left.  However I decided to take a look at the menu.  I started getting hungry and said, whatever.   I ordered the Spicy Crispy Beef.  10 long minutes later my dish came out.  It was a very small portion laid out on a bed of greens. The greens were soft and flaccid.  The beef was soggy and drenched in a greasy, oily sauce.  I was turned off by the place and decided to get out of there and chow down real quick.  When the time came to pay, my total was 8.99$ plus tax, however on the menu it was $7.99.  When I asked about this, I was told it was an old menu that needed to be updated.   She corrected the price, however it seemed to have annoyed her.If you are looking for somewhere to eat, just walk a few more minutes east along Gerrard and I'm betting wherever you stop will be better than this.",0
SCAMMERS! They came out( home warranty ) said there was 700 dollars of things to be fixed NOT covered. I didn't buy it... Got a second opinion and it only cost 40 dollars to fix!!!!! Do NOT use them... Rude girl in the phone also .,0
"My car was stolen, as was my next store neighbors. From what I have read on the internet this is a recurring problem. Yet no extra steps have been taken to mitigate this risk. Funny thing is that my car was stolen during the rare time of the year in which both gates were fully functioning. In addition I had to pay 70 dollars for gate and laundry keys that were in my car when it was stolen. Also was charged for carpet stains that were not visible when I moved in due to recently being cleaned. A clever way to pass of carpet cleaning costs to renters when it is illegal in NC see link for reference ( http://www.ncrec.gov/pdf/brochures/TenantSecurity.pdf ). Also the walls are paper thin, so you should hope you and your neighbor have similar music tastes. The AC units in the ceiling are sound like a diesel powered tractor. So when considering moving here based on price never forget you get what you pay for.",0
"7/28/19, 3:56pm. Cant get anyones attention to place an order. I see laughing and screwing around on company time. This is ridiculous",0
"This place is one of my favorite places and I love their food but this one worker with curly hair who was working the register at 6:15 on 5/28 was Extremely Rude! The moment me and my girlfriend stepped in we were criticized on what were wearing and asked how old my girlfriend and I were. He then proceeded to ask if music was ok and then started playing NWA and Bone thugs and Cuss word this and cuss word that, that I was embarrassed for him. Then other customers entered he pestered them to hurry up and about what they were gonna order. Then he would step outside to talk to his friends for a good 4 min while no one was watching over anything. There is so much more embarrassing and rude things that he did. We will not be returning to this location until he is gone.",0
"We went for lunch during the week. The restaurant had only 3 other tables our food took over 45 minutes to arrive only to come out cold and dried out. The server took the steak sandwich back to the kitchen to recook, with no visit from a supervisor or manager. Upon receiving the bill I inquired if the manager had been notified about the situation, the server replied ""yes, but she wasn't interested in rectifying the situation"". Server said that the management was indifferent to the operations of the restaurant. All around a very poor experience.",0
"GROSS. WASTE OF MONEY. It's worth it to pay a little more and go to arrowhead grill or Flemmings. I ordered the parmesan chicken. My chicken was undercooked and smothered in thick pasty sauce. I didn't want to be dying on the toilet the next day, so after one look at my plate and 2 bites, I gave up and bailed. My husband ordered the steak, and he said it was one of the worst he has ever had. All the side dishes were nasty. $50.00 bill for disgusting food that we couldn't even muster enough courage to eat. We left with our plates full of food.",0
"We sat at the bar, service was slow even though it wasn't busy. Drinks took forever, we have to ask someone to refill our drinks. Food was great as always but the service was horrible.",0
"Rude manager (or is it the owner?) who ""served"" me in monosyllables. Never again. I went solo that day, but I also noticed that they had a nasty letter on the door before Hallowe'en that forbids teens from entering the store without an adult, along with a litany of other draconian ""store policies"". I sadly do not recommend this place, based on the complete lack of manners and service within.",0
"Wow.I can't believe how incredibly bad this place was. I wish I could rate this place zero stars.  I was there as part of a group of 11 and have never experienced service this bad at a restaurant so highly rated. I clearly got the sense that the waiter (Corey J) knew that his 20% tip for large parties was in the bag and just didn't give a damn.Details that a restaurant like this shouldn't miss often were: not clearing bread crumbs before setting down appetizers, leaving water glasses empty, etc. The waiter would disappear for large periods at a time. He often didn't know who ordered what.The food was also lackluster. Although my mushroom soup was fine, the steak I ordered was prepared with a shallot sauce that wasn't listed on the menu. When I complained to the waiter he said that he was ""fairly certain"" he described the preparation to me because he usually does. He later brought out a replacement that was bloody red, not the medium I had ordered. I ended up paying $35 for a steak I barely touched.I also tried some of my friend's gnocchi and it was extremely sweet. Around the table, the best anyone rated for food quality was ""OK"". The place had a lot of promise - nice atmosphere, I liked how the menus were presented.",0
"I lived in the midwest and frequented many a county fair.  Well, when I took my food home and opened it, it smelled like when you would walk into the livestock barns.  No kidding, that exact smell.  Absolutely revolting.  Needless to say it went straight into the garbage.",0
"I went to this place in July of 2018. I have pretty good time there. Food and service is good. So after finished everything, my bill come up $42 dollars I used my remaining balance from a gift card and $19 clearly left of my credit card to pay them and gave appreciation to our service %16=$6.72+$19=$25.72 of our total amount signed and left. Couple days later, I checked my bank transaction I see that they charged $29.02. I know it's only couple bucks but I hate it when place pull it shit like this and it could ruin your repetition. Food Overcharge or service overcharge. Quick tip: Checked your bank total amount.",0
"Not worth the hype. The place is still swarming with people for some reason even though the food is mediocre and overpriced.Came at around 10 (opening) on Saturday and the place is filled with hosts/waiters. It's ridiculous how much staff is just waiting around looking for things to do. The overall process of checking in was difficult because the two people who are actually trying to get people seated are swarmed by people with buzzers. Why they had buzzers in the first place I don't know because the place literally just opened. There's no organization whatsoever. Anyway I got seated eventually and got my order taken. We ordered an app and 2 entrees and 30 minutes later we receive our 2 entrees and our app afterwards... like ok? It would've been nice to actually eat my appetizer before my main, but instead I had to eat everything simultaneously so it wouldn't get cold.The food is soooo overpriced for what you get. If you're paying $25+ for an entree you might as well go to Joeys instead for a much better experience.",0
"Food was great but service was terrible. My family and I arrived a sat down in the waiting area and waited for about 10 minutes with different waitresses passing by us many times and not saying anything and It was not packed whatsoever. Once we were seated and were served our food we noticed we didn't have any cutlery so we asked a waitress if she could please get us some and she came back with two forks and gave them to us, in my opinion completely unsanitary since most of the time you receive the fork, knife and spoon wrapped in a napkin. Our waitress never came back to see if we needed anything else or see how we were doing. We were sat by the kitchen and saw a waitress on her phone multiple times. The staff doesn't seem to like their job no smiles nor greetings during our stay.",0
WILL NOT BE BACK!!! We had a very sweet waitress but the steaks we ordered came out bleeding. We ordered them with no pink and they were served almost rare. The cook put mine back on the grill but only on the part that I had cut into so the rest of my steak was still raw and my husbands was literally bleeding. The manager pretty much said there was nothing else they could do. Just ridiculous.,0
"From a large city with better access to Southeast Asian foods, I'd say this place is terribly overpriced, under-portioned, and sub-quality. The ex-large bowl of pho I ordered had very little noodles. You cold grab the noodles in one grasp. The rest was all broth.The broth was obviously powdered + peppered beef broth. They gave you less bean sprouts and basil than other places.",0
"When I was there a few days ago, my server I believe her name is Amy.. (long black hair, pretty young) started out pretty good, dj was great, awesome music! I wanted to buy him a cocktail for the awesome performance so I asked Amy to please put in a drink from us for him... She said she would, brought a drink to the dj and also took a shot with him. Didn't think it was a big deal, until both shots were on my tab. And on top of that we never saw her again. About 45 minutes later we walked up and another girl helped us pay for our tab. Hospitality is key in Vegas and this is why we come.. we expected more and received less. Being that this is our first time to rhumbar it will now be our last. Seeing that you allow your servers to put drinks on tabs that aren't supposed to be there and also drink on the job is pretty disturbing. Please re train your cocktail servers or maybe don't allow them to not only drink on the job (forgetting their customers) but not to charge customers for cocktails they do not order.",0
"When our group arrived we were told that the 3rd and 4th floors were being remodeled.  The rooms they placed us in looked like they had never been remodeled.  They smelled of chlorine and had carpeting and furniture from the 80s.  We had stayed in this hotel many times before and the remodeled rooms were in much better shape.  The final straw was when my colleague checked into her room, she walked in on a naked man laying on his bed working on his computer.  The young male clerk at the front desk just shrugged at our absolute horror that this could happen and said he could not ensure our safety or that someone would walk in on us as they rely on the computer to let them know if a room is occupied or not.  We checked out and went to Hawthorn Suites down the road which coincidentally was owned by the same management group.  The Wyndham clerk never once offered us the opportunity to stay there.  The young lady at the Hawthorn hotel was very accommodating and gracious.",0
"Terrible experience!  I will never go back. Staff was rude, wait was 30 min longer than they said.  We settled for a table outside. Heaters were broken. Our drink and food order took forever as well as our food. Food was cold. Really it couldn't have been worse. We ended up there nearly 3 hours not by choice.  Worst experience ever.",0
"I am so disappointed. I was excited to buy my brand new fridge, dishwasher and my first front load washer and dryer. I came prepared with my measurements in hand, I carried them all around the store as the sales man informed me about the the different appliances. He reassured me everything would fit just like my old appliances without looking at the measurements. He said the sizes were pretty standard and it would be fine. The appliances were delivered the next day and NOTHING FIT. The washer and dryer also do not fit and because I have an older house the water is on the opposite side so the washer and dryer doors open into each other. I also have to have them staggered because the water line hoses stick out to far. The NEW dishwasher has RUST STAINS, which the delivery guy told me, "" was just on the protective coating."" I am so disappoint that I trusted this employee owned company. They sales man said he has been doing this for 15 years and the company states that they are the ""experts"" in appliances and are better than those big boxes stores. But maybe I should have bought from a big box store... At least they know how to use a measuring tape.",0
"My 3 sisters and myself took our mom to see this for her birthday last night. We spent well over $550 for our tickets. We were expecting amazing! This show was far from that. We were so disappointed. Criss spent too much time arguing with drunk people in the crowd. We sat and watched his do a tribute of himself of family photos. He brought a 14 boy up on the stage and sexually harassed his, this part was very unacceptable. I expected to see one magic act into the next with amazing entertaining. We drove far for this and it took a lot of planning to get all of us sisters together. So disappointed in this show.",0
not satisfied at all. I can't even buckle my seat belt up me being a heavier person. They bought down my interest rate and up the price of the vehicle. I need a suv which they couldn't get me approved for however the lancer they could. This car sucks. my son is tooooo tall for this car.,0
Out of beer? Going out of business or poor management? Hopefully a new place comes in that cares.,0
Horrible service and food is ehhhh. Wait in line somewhere else. It will be worth it. You have to tip before your seated too. Weird....,0
"I would literally rather live in a scorpion-infested teepee on the side of the freeway than deal with this NIGHTMARE of a company.  My story is complicated, but I take responsibility for my hand in it.  Long story short, I signed a 12-month lease on a house one month before I was able to move into it.  I didn't want to lose the house, so I signed the lease.  AH4R was able to hold the house for two weeks before the lease was going to start, so the house was going to sit vacant for only two weeks.  Before the lease even started, my situation changed, and I was no longer able to live in the house.  I knew I was going to be penalized for needing the break the lease.  Breaking the lease is my fault.  I expected a reasonable amount of flexibility, like surrendering my security deposit, in exchange for being let out of the lease.  The lease hadn't started.  I hadn't moved into the house.  AH4R held me to my lease, but would allow me to transfer the lease.  I posted ads for the house myself, drove 850mi roundtrip to show the house, and found qualified tenants myself, just three days into my lease.  I expected to have my security deposit and prepaid rent returned.  I asked AH4R for the money owed to me, and they turned around saying I owed them money for a $650 transfer fee and damages.  I filed a claim in small claims court, which got interesting because I had to find out who the property owner (not AH4R) is, locate their statutory agent, and serve them.  The owner corporation ended up sending me a check for the money that was rightfully mine before a court date was set, so I dropped the suit.Additionally, when I realized I had to break my lease I asked the leasing agent for assistance with relisting the house on their website.  According to AZ state law, landlords must make a ""reasonable effort"" to rerent a property when a tenant needs to break a lease.  The leasing agent Amy Ferolie told me that wasn't her job and to call ""customer service.""  I called back and spoke to her supervisor, who was no help.  Amy called me back and literally yelled at me.  Screamed at me on the phone, telling me never again to call customer service about her!  I tried to get access to the house by calling the field inspector assigned to my property.  I called for several days with no response.  After calling around to the leasing agent and property manager, I found out he was no longer with the company.  No one bothered to let me know, as I was trying to get keys to show the house.  I tried working with the property manager Susana Perez to discuss refunding the money owed to me.  She was impossible to reach, so I resorted to sending her certified letters in the mail to ensure she had gotten my request to get my money back.Luckily, my situation worked out well.  After legal action, I got my money back.  You may not be so lucky.",0
"Food 1/10Service 1/10Band 8/10First, all the meat was way over cooked and had a weird smell to it. I think they only used grade A meat at best. Way too chewy and no flavour. The beef had too many big chunks of fat.The salad bar was mostly empty and for some reason we didn't get any meat for the first 15-20 minutes. The wait staff were extremely slow although the place was fairly empty. I ordered some fried bananas  at the end of my meal which took almost 20 minutes to bring out. P.S they came out cold due to the long wait. Wait staff never bothered to check in or clear the table at any point during the mealAlthough the band was great, I would never come back to this place.",0
"I took my dog here due to a cough Dr. Taylor gave her a ""cortisone shot"" and 24 hrs later my dog was dead ! I called them and  talked to the reception which said she would let the dr know. Well it's the next day and still nobody returned my phone call!  So I called again,The reception just said ""well I don't know what you want me to say"" Really!? Well I suggest if you love your animals DO NOT TAKE THEM THERE!!",0
"Super slow, my burrito was not even wrapped up tight like it should have been. I opened up the foil and it went everywhere. They didn't have any silverware or napkins. Good thing there were other food trucks nearby that i could grab a fork from them. The guy cooking the food was friendly but everything else was sloppy. For 9.50 it was not worth it. Will not be returning to this food truck. Wish I would have taken a picture but I was so hangry I didn't get to it.",0
"Being refused service on a Sunday night for no reason day service Mel,Deb ,Sam, Sherry,Amanda and Erika give the best service then any night crew in the bar  ever go see them Mike does not care till it's on here seriously the server(KR) refused to serve our table and walked right by us waited 8 min before I asked if we were going to get served it was not busy btw when she just served the exact same  table 10 min prior I love the  great day servers you get real people who care and take care of their customers!!

"Imagine you've prepaid for a private ride, provided airline information and all. Then you arrive at late night after a 6 hour flight but have to sit at the airport because you can't even reach the dispatcher after landing. I tried and tried for 20 minutes, then took a cab so I wouldn't have to sleep at the airport. This company isn't worth your money.Oh and by the way I've asked the SuperShuttle guy, same company, standing right there what's going on here, and he laughed in my face and said it's all the time like that. Interesting business model.",0
"I can't even give 1'star of a review for this company. I was picked up on a Wednesday at 2:00am driven to MGM Grand . My wallet was left in cab#1459. As the cab left the driveway of the the hotel, we called the company to report my wallet being left in the back of the taxi.  Called company to have them turn around before next pickup. Dispatcher was VERY rude, and after a few discussions (and being hung up on twice) she said taxi was refusing to come back to the hotel for us to check back of vehicle. Got taxi number from hotel security and tried filing complaint, also called Las Vegas non-emergency line to fine report. This taxi service has the worst customer service ever. Please stir clear if possible.",0
Spent 3 nights here and paid the $84 for resort fees and thought I would be able to use the WiFi but my phone couldn't use the wifi while in the hotel but every other hotel I went to I could had great reception. Also noticed that they took the $200 out of my account for the deposit incidentals. We didn't break anything in the room or trash it so we should have got the whole thing back when I called to ask why it cleared my account they said it should post back in my account in 10 days this makes no sense at all. Now I have to call back when I don't see it come through. Don't really care for this hotel and won't be back,0
"The most disgusting experience I've ever had at any restaurant in my life. While waiting 20 minutes for French fries, the entire dining room g9t to listen to 2 employees argue over who was going to be forced to stay past their shift. The reason one employee was going to have to stay, is because the cook was in the kitchen in full view of everyone, vomiting into a garbage can while everyone he just handled and cooked food for, had the pleasure of hearing and seeing him do this. Thank God the service was so horrible and my fries took so long, because had I gotten my food sooner I would've been one of the unlucky patrons that would have ingested this disease/germ plagued food. I immediately demanded a refund, no one apologized, and I left. I couldn't help but to feel sorry for everyone in the drive thru who was now eating food made by someone who had no business handling food. I will never eat here again, the place is always dirty, tables are always a mess. The employees are awful, they act like they are doing you a favor by giving you $10 chicken nuggets. Don't eat here unless your looking for food poisoning. Totally unsafe and disgusting. Shame on you popeyes for endangering the welfare of the public because your manager is too lazy to run a fryer. Yuck, NEVER again!!!",0
"Unacceptable. If your hungry, and by that I mean, you want more than a 200 calorie lunch, go elsewhere. Portion sizes are pathetic. I had been there 3 years ago and I was dragged back by a few friends today. For 10 bucks plus tax I received3 oz of romaine lettuce 1 oz of hummus1.5 oz of ""lamb""To top it all off, we asked multiple times for hot sauce which, not surprisingly, was not included in the bag. Overall, I think these people are unaware of how to garner repeat customers, evidenced clearly by the paucity of humans in the poorly decorated establishment at peak lunch hours.In general, stop cheating customers, bro.",0
"Dr Brown and Karen came out this evening to help put our baby girl Selia to rest and feel no more pain.

"Slow service, cold food. Missing food from carry out. This place needs help. The quality of the egg sandwich was affected because the food was cold in the center. Bagel was average",0
"Absolutely horrible. I literally took time out of my march madness betting and game watching to review this place. First of all, the name says it all it's NOT YO DADDY (and not yo daddy's nacho). I'm almost 100% positive that anyone that likes this place is 1 of 3 things. 1. Drunk and sunburnt on the brain. 2. A person who literally has never been to a movie theater (and had waaayyy better nachos for half the price). 3. Someone who doesn't even know hat nachos are supposed to be. Heck, try Cheesecake Factory appetizer nachos (those are actually really good and Cheaper), try Taco Bell nachos, or the nachos from del taco, you'll have a better result. Instead of putting your soggy Costco chips covered with dry flavorless chicken and NO toppings (e.g. Sour cream, salsa, etc.), why don't you just close your business and sell it to Starbucks so it can benefit us (and yes I know there is a Starbucks already right around the corner in the Elara lobby). Worst nachos ever. And why put nachos in a cardboard pizza box for ""to go"" purposes? They must not have tested that. Try walking to your room in PH, Elara, or Grand Chateau with these things and see how warm they are. Oh nice touch to have the cardboard stuck to the melted cheese... FYI if it's not in-n-out, I don't want cheese paper or any other type of container stuck to my food.I will say this. After 10+ hours of reflection, I have some additions. Their management (Taylor) is very profesional and seems to genuinely care about the business doing a proper job. So credit (and the 1 forced star that Yelp demands) goes to her and her staff. If the food prep staff was as professional, perhaps my review would have been a bit different. Nevertheless the Decor in the establishment is nice and appropriate for what they must be paying for a rental space in a center strip view Vegas hotel. Although I wouldn't recommend it, it seems that most people seem happy with it, so gl NYD!",0
"Understaffed, went to this location and there was only one person working. My son and I waited for 30 minutes to be served, we eventually left because no one was at the register....avoid this location if possible.",0
This is the worst medical care!!! They do not follow up! The do answer or return calls!! The front desk staff is rude and uncaring about patients. They make you feel second class. The Dr.s need customer service skills.,0
"Went there about a month ago for lunch, the patio was packed and of course had no choice but to sit inside.Ordered an Iced Tea & an Axis Club. The food was great BUT unfortunately the table service sucked!!! Would I go back to Axis,,,,,,NO Great service is essential & without great service what's the point of going there!",0
Went here to get my girlfriend coffee because of the awesome reviews. I ordered a vanilla iced coffee with soy and I have to say it was disgusting. Luckily there was a starbucks down the street from my lady's job and I was able to redeem myself for bringing her that insult to coffee. Not sure if they just sucked this morning or if people just like the taste of cat piss but it is a no for me. I also got her an apple Danish which I was told was also a disappointment. Come on guys! Tighten up. Coffee saves lives so make it right.,0
This place is horrible asf. I come in trying to enjoy some breakfast. They served me some old ass sausage McMuffin not even with the right cheese on it!!! The little things matter!!!!! Omg. They don't even deserve a star. But sadly i had to give them one order to post this. Everyone save your money!,0
"Just to add to what the other person said about a less-than-welcoming environment, I called trying to reach the main ICA office, but I guess the preschool's number is listed as the ICA number that I found online through Yelp I think? Anyway, the person answered that it was the preschool, so I said, ""Oh I'm sorry I'm trying to reach the main ICA office."" There was a giant pause. Finally the lady said, ""Ok."" More pause. ""Are you asking me for a number or something?""I was expecting a MUCH BETTER customer service experience, especially from a Christian organization. No offer to transfer, no offer to provide the main number. I wasn't asking them for the number to order pizza, I was trying to reach the main school which is connected with the preschool. I was so shocked at how rude this lady was who answered the phone that I ended up just hanging up figuring I'd do better to get the info myself.",0
"There are numerous problems with this company as a high speed internet provider:1) Customer Service: expect wait times of 20+ minutes nearly every time you have to call regardless of day/time.2) Speed: run a speed test after getting hooked up.  I was on a 7 mbps plan but could only get 2-3 mbps.  When I called to complain, I was told they didn't promise me any particular speed (I referenced my bill where is specifically says 7 mbps).  They had nothing to say to that other than I would never get that speed at my address (85048 zip code).3) Billing: I have to call nearly every month to get a paper bill sent to me.4) Online: I have never had as much difficulty setting up an online account with any company.  After I moved, it seemed impossible at times to get my new service address added to my online account so that I could pay it online (due to rarely getting bills sent to me in the mail).  It easily took 10 phone calls to make it happen.5) Sales: when I moved, I was told that my contract date would not change and that I would only have 1 month left in my contract. Six months later, when I couldn't keep the service due to dozens of intermittent outages per day, I was told that I had 6 months left in my contract. Escalating the call to a supervisor did not help and I was told I would have to pay $200 to get out of the contract. My appeals did not get any sympathy from them.Overall, when you (eventually) get these people on the phone, they aren't concerned about customer service. I will never use their service ever again.",0
"The owner of Dance Deluxe Alexis promised a lot and fell super short, like really short, like never got off the ground after she fell short. There were no official try outs for company so the junior company was made out of half experienced dancers and the other half, dancers that couldn't finish a routine with out taking out the dancer next to them which resulted in my dancer as well as the others sitting for half the class while the newer dancers tried to learn/catch up.  After I expressed my concern about the junior team or lack there of and how my daughter was frustrated because some kids were always goofing around she replied with i am sorry come in and watch her and give it some more time.  It only took me a week to realize that this place was a joke and so I asked for a pro rated refund.  They still have not answered my email.  This place literally lured people in with promises rainbows and lots of lollipops.  The place looks totally legit and it should considering she copied everything from Just Dance AZ down to the schedule.  This is a recreational goof around dance studio for the price of a company team.  You don't need to spend over 200 a month for your kid to learn how to pop lock and drop it.  Oh!! Best part... They charge you over 100 for a used costume!!!lI would like to add that the owner twisted my concerns and told the remaining dancers (under the age of 10) that my daughter and others that found a better suited studio that we were too good for them and that they held our dancers back..... the owner is in college for child development yet I cringe reading the other reviews about how she has mistreated young children and then to tell them about an adult conversation. SHAME on Alexis!!! You should be disgusted and I hope no one buys your GROUPON!!!!",0
"Went to look at a 2017 Rogue SV or SL and test drive to consider buying. Instead, was consistently told I should look at the 2016s.

Uh...why, if selling cars, would you not show me the one I want to see, the year I want to see, the mid level trim or higher trims, or generally know ANYTHING about the car? ""Oh, hey! This one has a third row! Didn't know we had those!"" Way to inspire confidence in a $30,000 purchase.

"Made my last shopping trip to B&C today, customer service is terrible, I was made to feel I did something wrong by spending $400 the other day on a Spider & Blet and then having to exchange the $31 belt for a $29 belt today because the $31 belt didn't fit. When I ask to just get the $2 refund (I paid cash) they acted as if I had asked for their first born, made excuse after excuse, told me that it would ""Look funny if they returned the $31 item and gave me the difference of $2, would look suspicious in their computer""....really? Exactly how is it suspicious to refund me my $2?  I understand the All Sale Final and it makes complete sense on lens, cameras, and other things that people might try to buy and return instead of renting, but the belt had all of the original tags intact and had been purchased 2 days prior.   Their attempt to make it square with me, and not refund my $2, was to give me a cleaning cloth priced $9.95, the beauty of this..... was that she totaled the register and says to me that will be $8.06 ...SERIOUSLY... I just stared at her for a minute, and then told her I am not spending another dime in here, I never wanted the cleaning cloth in the first place, as I have a hundred at home.The other employee in the store (male) says just discount the cloth so that is free.... Ok, so let me get this straight, It looks better in their system to write off a balance of a sellable item then it does to simply give a customer their change??? WOW.  Best part was she could not for the life of her figure out how to make it zero out with tax.  At this point I just told them just forget the $2 and give me the new belt and they can just keep the dang money. It was $2 for gods sakes.At this point the male employee comes over and with a snarky tone says ""Just give her the $2 I will take it out of my pocket""....AGAIN SERIOUSLY!!!!  I was treated like I was doing something wrong.  I explained that this would be my last time shopping there, and that I would make my purchases on Amazon or at the trade shows where I am treated with some respect. Just a suggestion B&C, you might want to start training your 20-something employees some customer service skills. $2 just cost you a customer...keep in mind it isn't because of the dollar amount but rather principle and the way I was treated.",0
"Went through today because it was the taco happy hour time and 1.49 is a great deal for a couple of tacos. Apparently, they decided to increase by .05 but did not change their signs or give any forewarning of this increase, which is false advertisement. Sure, raise it a couple cents here or there, people won't get mad, but don't charge someone a different price than what is listed. And don't end up like the McDonald's case where a sausage biscuit used to be 1.29 last year but they raised it a few cents here and there and now it's over 2.50. At least the update their signage before charging customers a different price.",0
j alexanders is delicous if you ever get seated. we were told we had a 25 minute wait. 50 minutes later there were no tables in sight and we bailed. much better experience in chicago than cleveland. won't go back!!!,0
"this plays blows.. the food is decent but the portions are tiny..the main course was smaller than an appetizer at a normal place yet they charge the same if not more. if you choose to eat here, prepare to hit up some mcdonalds or jack in the box after.. or you can just go to deluxe next door and get their chicken panini!",0
"I wish I could say that the more things change, the more they stay the same but...no.  After changing locations, it's nothing but lipstick on a rotten pig's head.  I ordered my wife and I's standard pickup order, get there and it's incorrect.  There is a sauce called a la Lino's on one dish that she likes on chicken parm and extra on the side.  I pay extra because it's off menu and worth it.  After repeatedly being told that I can't do this and they will not provide my order as I want, I ask for a refund.  One very courteous person at the counter tells me I have to wait till the next day as a manager isn't there for a refund.  Another employee, gives me a look only a complete jerk would employ and grunts at me and said something under her breath.  That's it.  I'm pissed.  I walk out, shoving the door.  The food is gross.  Literally soaking in incorrect sauce and just....substandard to the fantastic food I'm used to here.  It's also SO salty it's truly inedible.   My wife calls the next day to ask about the refund because I don't want to lose my cool as I'm still miffed about the previous night.  She's told an hour after opening the manager still isn't there and that he'd call back.  Shady.  To my shock, Nick DID call back.  He called back and cursed my wife out, telling her to go somewhere else, that he doesn't care about bad reviews and that he didn't even cook it.  No kidding, jerk...you don't seem to be there a ton.  I would LOVE to use the language that he did to shed a light on the utter classless stance this business owner took with long time repeat customers...but I won't.  Lots of F you's, I'll leave it at that.  I was SO upset he was treating her that way, I told her to tell him I was heading up there and to have police ready to save his midget ass when I was done with him.  The audacity to call it 'customer service'...  The loser finally told my wife that he would re-make everything after her complained that he couldn't just NOT serve wrong food because it costs him too much.  Can't trust that.  Had a few bites of Nick's food and it was the same sloppy, salty mess that was thrown away.  Do NOT give this excuse of a cook your money.  He treats employees like dirt...you should have heard what he said about THEM.  He treats customers like relatives that just won't leave.  I'm sure he even kicks his dog.  I just hope he doesn't feed them food from Lino's.",0
"Only giving 1 star because you can't do anything less.  The service is bad. Took an hour to get our food and it was cold, as if it had sat the whole hour that we waited for it.  No flavor, not even the salsa.  It was short of disgusting.  What a disappointment.  Not even the fact that we were starving made it taste good.  Thumbs all the way!",0
I had a few cavities filled there October and November of  last year. I decided to see a new dentist and was told that the cavities need to be redone because they missed some spots. I paid Aspen close to 500.00 to fill my cavities and now I have to pay that again due to incompetence. I do not recommend Aspen. The dentists are incompetent and the wait times are ridiculous.,0
"I used to love going here. Not anymore. New staff don't understand when I say don't cut my cuticle (which BTW is against recommendations and guidelines). So the last time I went, I was dealing with hangnails for two weeks.",0
"I don't care how cheap you find a room, don't stay here!!!  First off, the check in line is about 2 hours long.  When we checked in the hallway to our original room smelled really weird (very similar to a pet store) and was slightly squishy.  We later found out it was because a sewage line had broken and the floors were covered in poo.  When we arrived in our very very small rooms, there were gross dirty clothes under one of the beds and the small bathrooms were filthy.  We tried to go outside to swim and escape the sewer smell but the pool was closed because of killer bees.  That night a really creepy looking guy broke into our room while we were sleeping and then ran off.  The hotel security said that they couldn't do anything about it but comp us two free breakfasts the next morning (there were 8 of us).  After having our room broken into the next day we were fairly insistent that we at minimum needed a room change.  After being huge jerks about it for almost an hour, they finally moved us to the main tower.  While the room was nicer, it hardly made up for the previous day.  Plus, the pool was closed for almost two hours that day because people kept puking in the pool.  Really fucking classy people.",0
"I was so disappointed in this hotel. It was my first trip to Vegas and I have always wanted to stay at the Luxor. It really didn't take long for me to figure out it was a mistake. we stayed in a pyramid room instead of the towers. After checking in we went to the elevator and that is where I noticed the buttons. For floor number 6 instead of having a metal number like all the other floors it actually had been drawn on with a SHARPIE pen! I was appalled but kind of laughed it off. Once we reached our floor and got out I noticed the carpet in the hallway was starting to pull up and looked like it needed to be tightened. Once we opened the door to the room a wave of heat hit me like a ton of bricks. I get that they don't leave the AC on all day but it had to be 90* in there! I walked over to the wall unit and cracked it up but it looked so old and out dated. It never seemed to work properly. The TV/dresser cabinet was so banged up and a drawer pull was missing. There was also no room service menu to be found. I was so upset, this is not how I wanted my first experience in the wonderful Las Vegas to be. We stayed for 4 nights and for 3 of those nights there was a used room service cart sitting in the hallway. Also some beer bottles sitting on top on the garbage can by the elevator. If you are are wanting to plan a trip and want to stay in Luxor, I suggest you wait until they do some MAJOR remodeling. Better yet stay more in the center of the strip. Everything was so outdated here and it was all and all just an unpleasant experience. I know one thing for sure... I will NEVER stay in this hotel AGAIN!",0
"I spent 2 nights 3 days in this hotel in my visit.  Here's my breakdown:- wifi internet is indeed free of charge, but ut is at 1 mb/s.  Meaning you have to spend about a minute to open facebook.  I ended up using my data plan instead.- room and bathroom walls look like it is an 18th century place, no it is not historic, it is old and cracked.- bathroom is tiny.- they will barely give you shampoo.  I am a man with almost no hair and one bottle barely get me through a good shower.  I wonder what would be the case for women with longer hair.- breakfast is limited like all other hotels I have been to, but I was honored to have egg shells in my scarmbeled egg on two consecutive days.   Am I lucky or is it a standard in the scrambled eggs! !!- price wise, you can go to the fanciest hotel and casino on the strip for the same money.Simply put.  I am extremely disappointed with Mariott that this will be the last time I ever use them.",0
The girl that had all these piercing in her ears was AWEFUL!!!  Down right rude to me and my son!!!! I will NEVER return to that location!!!!!!!!,0
"We spent over 100 on pizza, spaghetti and salad delivered to a hotel.   No plates, napkins, or silverware were delivered.  I called and talked to the Manager.   He said well did you ask for that?   Seriously, you are delivering to a hotel?  He was very condescending and then hung up on me.   Never, ever, ever order from these jerks!  EVER!!!",0
Terrible service! Do not take your phone here. The owner is more concerned about losing money than satisfying her customer.My phone screen cracked. Nothing major but needed a replacement. I had to take my phone back three times because she failed to fix it. I ended up just asking for my money back before she finally replaced the screen again. I wasted time and money and she never even apologized. Rude!,0
"We have had a bad experience since day one at this hotel. On our first day the air conditioner stopped working with temperatures ar 102 F. I suffer from chronic migraine and that triggered my migraine immediately. On the second day we realized that the walls are not sound proof. We could hear our loud neighbors. The same day there was a loud grinding noise coming from the ceiling. It sounded like someone was trying to unclog a drain from up stairs with the electric snake. In the third day all air conditioners were not working, the dining room light switch was broken which caused us to eat in the dark. The room sensors for the ac also had a hard time detecting movement to turn on. We found myself having to walk up to the sensor every five minutes so that it turned on. I paid full price for full services. Instead I got a service that even the worst motel would never give. Look for another hotel on the strip that has better services. Buyers beware you have been warned.",0
"This place is terrible. It smells like sweat mixed with tobacco on the ground floor, they charge $100+ for you to receive a package (free at every other hotel I've been to), no free WiFi, and terrible service. I can't imagine why anyone would stay here given the plentiful other options.",0
"Horrible.. came here after an excellent previous visit where I got a gorgeous set of coffin nails done. I decided to bring my friend with me for pedicures and we both purchased the deluxe $35 pedicure. It included a sugar scrub, ""massage"", and hot towel. This was just horrible I had barely put my feet in the water before the lady doing my nails started rushing and pulling them out to start filing not letting me even have my feet in for 3 mins. Like that's how fast she grabbed my foot out and got started with a very weak, useless service. She barely did anything just smearing products on and off quickly meanwhile my friend had the nail tech I had previously and he spent time letting her soak her nails and then giving her an actual massage and pedicure worth $35. I've attached pictures so you can see how fast she did a half ass job on my nails all ready to go meanwhile my friend is still letting her hot towel sit. Avoid this salon, it's not worth the money, all they do is bark in their language all day to each other probably talking shit about customers and doing half ass jobs that aren't worth the money they are charging. Do not go here!! Especially if all your trying to do is have a nice relaxing spa time for a pedicure. $35 is a lot for the deluxe package and I received some basic shit I could have done at home.",0
"This company is an absolute scam.  The old adage of ""you get what you pay for"" holds true here.  DO NOT give them any money!  Once they have your money they're done with you.  DO NOT expect to receive any support!I purchased an all-in-one kit containing a DVR, 4 cameras and all the necessary wiring etc in March of 2014.  After 2 weeks of use the pictures on my video feeds were filled with static bars so I contacted their support.  They have 3 contact options: phone, live chat or email.  I tried phone first.  After waiting on hold for over an hour I got disconnected.  Maybe it was a mistake so I tried again.  Nope, after waiting forever I simply got disconnected again.  OK so I tried the live chat.  The message on their support page stated Live Chat was available so I got in the queue and waited for my turn.  After an hour when it's finally my turn I get disconnected with the message stating Live Chat is not available at this time try again later.  That's odd because I went right back to the support home page and Live Chat still showed as available and it let me join the queue all over again.  Why would it let me join the queue again if it wasn't available?  I went and did something else only to find that when my turn arrived I simply got disconnected all over again.  So this left email as the only support option.  I emailed them my problem and waited for a response.  And I waited.  And I waited some more.  Finally after a week they replied.We went back and forth via email for a month, because they only reply like twice a week so it takes forever, before they agreed to let me send the DVR back for repair which I had to pay the shipping for as well.  Another month goes by and I get the DVR back.  The same one I sent them.  It was supposed to be a replacement but I got the same one back that I sent them.  The RMA status on their own website said it was a replacement.  It was not.  It even still had recorded footage from my home on it.  They still tried to tell me it was a replacement.  It was not.  As soon as I plug it in it has the same static problem it had when I mailed it to them.  As far as I could tell they did nothing at all except receive it, hold it for a month, and mail it back.  So I immediately contacted them again.This time they don't reply to my emails and I'm forced to contact the BBB for help.  The BBB gives them 3 weeks to reply and they never did so I contacted the BBB to complain and what did they do?  They gave them another 2 weeks to reply. What a joke!  Finally at the very end of the second time period Zmodo responds and I send the DVR back for repair a second time.  Another month goes by and I receive the DVR back.  This time they tell me it's a refurbished unit.  A refurbished unit they send me for a brand new unit I bought that only worked for 2 weeks!  What great support!This refurbished unit worked for two weeks before the bars of static came back again.  So now I've emailed them again and I've been waiting for days so far with no response so I'm probably going to have to go through the BBB again.  So since buying this ""security"" package back in March it's been broken or out for repair more than it's actually been in use.Other reviews on the BBB site state that this company purposefully takes their time in dealing with issues in order to chew through your warranty period and I wholeheartedly agree.  No phone or chat option.  Months to get anything done via email.  Even took 5 weeks to reply to a BBB complaint.  A few more months it was ""out for repair"".  All to take as much time as possible so that the one year warranty will expire and you'll be left with nothing.And now here I am again with a system that doesn't work and waiting on them to reply to my mail because their phone and chat options do not work.I cannot stress this enough to everyone who has read to this point:DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY ANY OF YOUR MONEY!!!",0
This Andrew guy was very rude when I asked them I needed air check. He actually sent me the Discount Tire because he was too busy to check my car. I haven't been around a tire shop that sends you to a different tire shop especially a competitive wine due to their laziness to provide customer service and more work. I love how he opened my door after I told him what my PSI should be at to be rude and have the courage to open someone's door is just not okay. I honestly hope he's not mentally ill because if so I definitely feel bad about leaving this post.,0
"We have bought a couple of cars from this dealership.  (We came here after a really bad experience right around the corner at the Jeep dealer where the sales people had bragged about how bad they had $rewed a previous customer).  The sale on our original vehicle went without a hitch.  The 2nd, not so well!  The deal was for a pickup truck, with a full sized spare.  Got the truck with a ""donut"" spare.  We called and complained, but management basically said it was too bad and so sad.  Called Chevrolet corporate and got some action.  Advice:  Make sure everything is in writing...go through the contracts in detail and if necessary unload the vehicles to be sure you have everything you were supposed to and then cross your fingers.This is strictly my opinion based on experience.",0
this has got to be by far the most shittiest taco bell I've ever been to. I went over there for a bit to eat a little after 9 o clock yesterday morning and as soon as I walked in there was puddles of water all over the floor WTF. Not to mention I could of easily slipped and fell  on my ass if I didn't notice all those damn huge puddles all over the floor. Also I waited in front of the registers for over 15 minutes and no one bothered to take my order.  How are these douchebags able to keep there Jobs?,0
"If you want the worst possible car wash experience come here. They don't offer towels to dry your car, the wash looks like shit and leaves stains, there's a fucking 10 minute cleaning limit, they really need to get their shit together. Only reason I went was for the grand opening free wash. Definitely would not waste money on this place",0
"Called Rush based on reviews as I was looking for some exterior waterproofing to protect our new kitchen. Central Phx has quite a bit of flooding due insufficient drainage, low curbs, old speed bumps and homes sitting at ground level.Had a conversation with Rush and he agreed to come out. I told him we weren't in a hurry and if he needed to book another day, that was ok. He said no, he'd come out on a Saturday and called back with a time later in the week to confirm.Saturday morning, Rush called to cancel. Understandable. His current appt was running long and it was up near Cave Creek. Didn't offer to reschedule but instead asked me to send pictures. Well, I knew that he had no interest in the work and even though I had suspicions, I sent the pics anyway. Not another word from Rush.He could have not wasted my time, but I guess it was easier to brush me off.Funny, he complained about Millenials not wanting to work hard and impacting his business. I won't speak to the quality of the work, but it seems to me he would do well focus on running a professional business before casting blame elsewhere.",0
"It pains me to do this, but it must be said.This place has gone down the drain. When it first opened I came here often and loved the videos of the plants growing on the screens, the food and the friendly service. I used to take many of my clients out here just so they could soak in the vibe. I've been here a few times within the past few months and each time my experience gets worse. Today really took the cake.I came in to order for take out. The place wasn't busy and I even got a parking spot out front! I put 20 minutes on the meter not imaging how my regular order of the Roosevelt which is basically avocado on toast could take any longer. I placed my order and waited, and waited and waited and waited. 37 minutes after the transaction time on my receipt my to go order comes out. The girl who handed it to me was incredibly rude and the box of food was wide open! To really sprinkle the sugar on top I walked outside to discover that not only did I get terrible service and wait forever, I had also received a parking ticket! I will not be returning here. There are too many other new places in downtown that make quality food, offer good service and can put a takeout order out in less than 40 minutes.",0
Your lunch buffet is normally good UNTIL you get to your crawfish STOP RE-HEATING THE DAMN CRAWFISH as if someone wouldnt notice you DO IT all the time.

"If they Offered MINUS 5 Stars... This office would get it. I HIGHLY Recommend NOT making an appt with this office. My review is merely factual in nature to express my experience and SUB STANDARD QUALITY of Care.I came in as a cash patient to get an exam to look at a mole. I previously expressed my worry and that ALL Cancers run in my family. I was brought back for the exam. The assistant put me in a room and left to get DR TRENT. I was not asked why I'm there. What my concerns were or even go get in a gown so the doctor could perform a PROPER and THOROUGH Examination. Dr Trent arrived, it was clear he had no idea why I was there or my Chief Concern... Nor had even reviewed my chart or the fact that cancer runs in my family and I felt very anxious and scared about my skin. That I wanted a full and thorough exam! He proceeded to try to look at the mole ünder my armpit. He could not see it because I had my scrub top on. I said this is ridiculous. I need to remove my scrub top. He said okay. And stood there waiting! THERE WAS NO Chaperone present! I felt Extremely uncomfortable!!!! Then he proceeded to look and say it was nothing. I asked, are you going to use magnification to be sure? He said no we don't do that. I said I came in for a full exam. He said where are the others? (As I am trying to pull up my pant leg for him to look).I was APPALLED at the Lack of Professionalism! And poor quality of care! He should be ashamed of himself! I felt like just a number.That isn't even the worst part! I leave.. Call them back and express all this to the front desk girl. She said I can come back in to see him again. I said I don't want to see DR Trent again! Can I go somewhere else? I was told he was the only doctor.... I called back 2 months later and talked to Kasey. She was very kind on the phone and listened to my concerns. I expressed all this again and told her I expect that they will make this right. She said she would send this to the proper channels. ... I HEARD NOTHiNg BACK!!!! Then I called June 12 ( another 2 months later!) and talked to Kasey Again. She said she hadn't yet heard from the ""upper management"" . I expressed that AS A PROVIDER MYSELF I understand the Quality of care! And what is expected! I told her your office and dermatologist Dr.Trent should be ashamed! I told her that the Las Vegas Valley and they being Specialists should be Rendering Proper Care!!!!! I demanded the number to Marissa who is the ""upper management"" that has been DISREGARDING MY CONCERNS Along with Dr.Trent! I would NEVER render Sub-Standard care to my patients! The Patient deserves way better.Take your money and go elsewhere. Dr.Trent could have called me. The front could have called me... The manager could have called me. But no one did. They don't care about their service or the Patient! Shame ON THIS DERM OFFICE!!!!!!!",0
"I would give this place 0 stars if possible, they always get orders wrong!!! The people are rude!!! To make sure I got my order right for once I asked for a Mc Griddle with bacon, eggs and sausage NO CHEESE and the girls response was Hold on let me check...OMG! Then she came back and said we can't do that. I have ordered that all the time because I don't like cheese in it and have always Paid Extra for it with no problem!!!!!! That's the only reason I would go to Mc D. I have gotten a screw in my fries and been gypped on my order. This place has so Many Homeless people in side and out side and the smell is horrible. That's why I did drive through but Forget It Now they have lost a customer for good!!!! Jacks I am your faithful customer now which is right across the street and always clean and personal is friendly! Don't eat at this place you will get food poisoning or a screw in your fries! Even harassed by Homeless!",0
"The worst airport experience ever. After clearing Canadian customs, transiting to the US passengers must pick up suitcases to clear the US customs and immigration before being allowed to drop off your suitcases. After spending quite a long time, I am finding that I cannot have the Air Canada lounge access. How am I going to spend a few more hours here?",0
"Although I've heard amazing things about their food, I never got a chance to experience it. Saturday morning breakfast rush I expected. We get there and there is a whole section of empty tables. Thinking we hit the breakfast rush break so time spot of the year. WRONG! We had 3 different people ask me how many were in our party. Not once were we told ""hold on one second or we will be right with you."". Even had a waitress walk by and make a comment about how we were still waiting. 15 minutes of standing there with no conversation as groups of people had started to grow behind us. At the 20 minute mark we decided the wait at bob Evans up the street would be a more beneficial wait considering they had seating.",0
"What a shit hole. I lakes in and went in to wash my hands. The urinal was overflowing on the floor. Someone had puked in the sink and left it, and there were no paper towels. I don't know about anyone else but I'm not eating there!",0
"This was the worst service we have ever had at a restaurant.We called at 6:40pm with a take-out order. We were told the order would be ready in 20 minutes and arrived at the restaurant accordingly. Once at Smoq Pit, we had to wait in line behind 8-9 other customers who did not think to order their food ahead of time. The employee at the counter kept telling them that things were sold out, but we were confident in our order being prepared because we had placed a take-out order. We reached the register at 7:20pm, a full 40 minutes after we called our order in. It was then that we realized how poorly managed the restaurant was. Our order slip was hanging on the rack, an ominous sign for sure. We reviewed our order with the employee and found out that they were sold out of every item we ordered. Every single item. No one thought to call me to let me know about this unfortunate series of events, even though I provided my phone number when I placed my order. Most infuriating about this situation is that the customers in line in front of me were leaving with food. The brisket that was sold out by the time I got to the register walked out the door with two young gentleman. A family eating in the restaurant had the cornbread that I had ordered. I am completely disappointed by this experience and I did not even have a chance to eat the food. I do not think I will be attempting to order from Smoq Pit again.",0
"I wish I could write a zero.  They clearly don't give a damn about good service, they'll survive on Friday and Saturday alone so they can suck all week.  I brought in 10 guys on a Monday night.  They messed up 10 orders.  As slow as possible with everything wrong.  Stay away? Go somewhere that they care about customers, this isn't your place.",0
This place is dirrrty. Food mediocre. Not to mention if you're not Korean they don't give you the best service. I guess if you're too busy taking people's money then who cares about opinions. Will not return.,0
Less than * is now what I previously thought was a good practice.  Wait 2 hours and get nasty attitude when asked when my turn would be after being ignored.  Room full of sick people and no one is moving.  Terrible service - no call back by Doctor or nurse-only rude-incompetent staff that probably never give the doctors the message anyway.  Only interested in billing for office visit when you might not need to be exposed to a room full of sick people if doctors talked to patients.Never experience of such terrible uncaring practice.  Wasn't always this way but something very wrong there now.  Do yourself a favor find another practice that have Doctors don't allow staff upfront to treat people like cattle.  Find a practice where Doctors actually communicate with their patients.  Everyone has electronic email communications now.  It's not too much to expect to be able to talk to your about a issue without having to sit like a puppet waiting for someone to yank the string.Patient's have rights too - we are free to go elsewhere - so that what I will do for my health and welfare.,0
"I know everybody hates the Marquee, so it would seem a bit redundant to write a review on this hell hole.  But with its approaching the very highest echelon of suckiness, I think it warrants further comment.Before last May, I hadn't been to the Marquee since 2010.  Back then, I just noted that it was drab and soulless, but a venue being nothing more than a large concrete cellar is not enough to warrant consideration for such a title as worst concert venue in America.Let's count the ways in which The Marquee Theater sucks.First, and this probably seems like a small gripe compared to some of the major problems with this place, you might have to pay $7 for parking.  I know a lot of venues charge $4-$5 for parking, but $7 is pretty steep.Second, they obviously don't know how to run a will call line.  Someone else has already mentioned an hour-and-a-half wait for will call for Trampled By Turtles.  I was in the same line - OK, I know they're unexpectedly mainstream considering the fact that they're a progressive bluegrass band from Duluth, but still, they're a progressive bluegrass band from Duluth.  That's not exactly a recipe for a long line.  The Marquee created that by having will call and sales IN THE SAME LINE.  Way to treat your customers who have already paid, you douchebags.  I attended about 35 concerts in 2012, some of which are more popular bands, and similarly sized venues.  I didn't wait longer than 10 or 15 minutes to get into any of them.If you manage to make it through the combined sales and will call line without going postal on the venue staff, then you get to be patted down by security!  I understand going through this procedure to get into a hip hop show.  But when is the last time a gang fight broke out at a Trampled By Turtles show?  Again, this is something unique to The Marquee - last year I attended shows at The Crescent Ballroom, Rhythm Room, El Rey, House of Blues LA, Royce Hall at UCLA, The Great American Music Hall, The Independent, Mesa Arts Center, The Neptune, Benaroya Hall, The Bowery Ballroom, and more - and at exactly zero of those venues was I patted down.  Music festivals?  Not patted down.  Bluegrass show at Marquee Theater?  Prepare to be violated.  This is not about safety, it's about stupidity.Finally, the most egregious deficiency this place has is the crappy sound.  I noticed this when I saw Of Monsters And Men last May.  Over by the side wall it sounded like a mess.  I kinda wanted to hear the band, so I went and stood directly in front of the sound board.  It sounded OK.  So, this is how it works: directly in front of the sound board, you can at least hear what they're playing.  Anywhere else, it sounds like you're listening to someone's audience recording over the loudspeakers.  At Trampled By Turtles, I stood near the sound board, and it took me a good 30 seconds to identify the first song (it turns out that it was one I had heard a good three dozen times before).  How hard is it to mix five acoustic instruments?  Either the acoustics here suck, they don't want to pay for a decent sound guy, or maybe both.  If you run a live music venue, your most important job is to make it sound good.  The Marquee is like going to a movie theater where they sit everybody down in front of a 1985 Sanyo CRT television.I have attended concerts in Phoenix, Tucson, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boulder, Telluride, Seattle, and New York, and I think now it is safe to say that this might be the very worst mid-sized concert venue in America.  Even the corporate Comerica Theater is better.  Theodore H., who is probably invested with this venue, says these complaints are all ""standard stuff.""  Again, I have been to venues across the United States, and this is all unique to The Marquee.  At this point, I think I can recommend staying away from here, even if one of your favorite bands is playing here.  Because it will just make you sad that you didn't really enjoy seeing one of your favorite bands.",0
"Just another typical rental agency. I usually dont need anything from them. I pay rent on time and dont ever deal with them. 4 years I have contacted them once a year to have the trees trimmed. There are 3 large trees and 7 palm trees all trees are over the height of 25ft (lease says 10ft and over rental agency will service). This year they have dodged my phone calls and emails regarding the issue. If you know palm trees you know they shed and make a mess everywhere. My neighbors have continuously complained to me and one has started to contact code enforcement. My emails for service began with invitation homes 7/15.They eventually got the service request processed and the vendor came 8/16. The vendor showed up and had to use my ladder, they left my side gate wide open and unlocked, they left tree trimmings and branches in my neighbors yard and left their tools in my backyard. The vendor only trimmed 2 trees, none of the palm trees. Invitation homes said the palm trees do not need to be trimmed as they are not hitting the house. I asked for a manager to contact me and nothing for a week. I eventually got through to the maintenance manager Nick and he said the vendor messed up and should've trimmed everything. Nick said he'd have the problem taken care of right away. It is now 9/16 and I was just told a manager would ""call"" me back.Just another typical rental agency not willing to take care of its properties.Update 10/11Nothing has been trimmed. Received a call from someone claiming to be from corporate on 10/1. Claiming they'd have the local office reach out to me. 10 days and still nothing.Update 11/15Still nothing done. Representatives of invitation have come out and taken photos of the trees and have said the trees should be trimmed. A vendor contacted me and set up a time to come trim the trees and within an hour they called back and said invitation canceled the work order. I contacted invitation and they said the vendor was not able to reach the height of the trees. I contacted the vendor and they said that was absolutely not true. They then provided me with their communications with invitation. So basically invitation lies. Not surprised. Is it possible to give a negative star review?",0

"Unfortunate that Yelp doesn't allow any rating lower than one star...this business doesn't deserve a single star based on my first (and final) visit.  All of the employees were standing outside when I pulled in.  Not a single one acknowledged me.  After a few moments, I decided to go inside since it was clear no one outside would help me.  The cashier's booth inside is empty - Again no one inside to assist me either.Finally I'm able to get an employee's attention who barely (& inaudibly) mumbles something & points to some guy with a clip board....the same clip board wielding guy who looked at me as I walked past but never acknowledged me.THIS PLACE IS EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL.  Surprised this place got such great reviews - their customer service (or lack there of) is embarrassing.",0
So disappointed on service tonight. It was a very busy night but that did not stop us. There were 5 people working the place and they were all talking and giggling so we were not able to sample anything unfortunately. We went up to pay for the yogurt and they would not allow us to use our coupons that they had taken before which was not cool. We sat down to eat and the girls kept giggling and talking about sawdust chapstick which was werid. We sat down as a family and dug in and a couple girls went over to taste the flavor mango that we had and normally get when we come in. They started to complain that it tasted like rust and they went and put a sign on it saying out of service. We were very confused since we just got that flavor and asked what was going on. They girls proceeded to say it was fine but then why did they just say it tasted like rust. My boyfriend asked for a refund but they would not give it. So we asked for different flavors and they allowed us to fill up again on something different. We got different flavors but on the way out I asked for the managers information and they said they could not give that information out. I then asked for when they were working and they couldnt give me that either. So apparently we can't talk to anyone about their service either. I just recently bough $90 worth of gift cards for this location so that I am covered for the summer and very concerned about this type of service. I wish they would teach their works to be more professional!,0
"Worst Mexican food I have had in a long time, maybe ever. I ordered a shrimp street taco and had to pull the tails off the shrimp if I wanted to eat it. Pulled the tails off but passed on the taco, veggies and shrimp were greasy. I also ordered a crispy machaca taco. It had more jalapeno in it than meat. It came still folded with the lettuce and pico in the side for me to put together. It broke into pieces when I opened it and when I saw the insides, I passed on that, as well. I kindly paid and split, totally disappointed. I knew I should have ran when I walked in and there was a dirty Kleenex on the counter.",0
Ugh. I cringe every time I go in here. The black girls are so rude. They follow you around the store. Like come on...I don't live in Toronto so when I come here I like to stock up on things. When I ask a question they don't know what I'm talking about. This black girl recommended me a face mask which I told her I'm acne prone skin and I used it and it burned my face. Gave it another shot and it still burns. Please hire people who know what they're talking about. Plus they just stare at you. And look and play with their hair. So cringeworthy.,0
Went to basil in Stonecrest for first time last night. They said wait would be 15 minutes but was more like 30-35. We finally got seated and waited 15 minutes for waiter to come to table. He apologized but was very short with us and was clearly overwhelmed. Food was average. As I was eating I overheard other patrons complaining how bad their service was. At one point I counted 7 dirty tables with no one cleaning up. Don't think I will be back anytime soon. So many better places in charlotte now.,0
Avoooooooid this! Crazy long wait! Waited for an hour and still waiting! I came Tuesday night at 11pm and now it's Wednesday! I used to have good experience with dollar in Connecticut but not this store. should have checked the reviews before choosing this place. There are over five other rental companies you can chose from and non of them have 30+ ppl waiting in line like this place!,0
Bland food...everything comes as an extra...including salt & napkins...shrimp ceviche the worst in town...couldn't even find a way to get flavor in salsa or guacamole..3 thumbs down..,0
"I've had to retype this review about 6 times before I could do it and leave out my inappropriatly worded frustrations. Im a huge vinyl toy collector. I have thousands and thousands of dollars of collectables. I used to commute to New York from central Jersey to buy Kidrobot, I then used to commute from Denver to Boulder to buy Kidrobot before the store closed. Now when I stay in Summerlin, you better believe Im going to commute down to the Cosmo to check out the new store. I walked in with a smile from ear to ear with my husband and brother in law after checking out the giant figure outside the store. The store is minature. There is absolutely no excuse for why we were not greEted. The employee didnt even look up from his computer once to acknowldge us. After picking out some items we went to get rung up. I think the employee said 2 words and that was it, no thank you, thanks for coming, no smile, FUCKING NOTHING! whoops there I go again, well im not rewritting it this time. This experience was bullshit. If blind box items were returnable I would have returned every last item I purchased. 100% DISGUSTED WITH MY EXPERIENCE.",0
"DO NOT STAY HERE! It is a nightmare!!!! It's filthy, in a very sketchy part of town and definitely not worth the money. My sister and I stayed for edc weekend and paid about $200 a night!!! Everything needs a deep cleaning. Some rooms still have disgusting old appliances stinking of cigarettes , floor is uneven, beds are a pile of springs, two chunky pillows were including with each bed. Cab from the airport was $70, uber/lyft to the strip is $20-$30 so you are not saving money. I thought it would be easier being close to the speedway and away from paid parking- walking through the casino lobby in barely a bikini... if it was a nice hotel it would have been perfect but this place needs a serious remodel, upgrade linens, clean the mildew under the toilet rim, clean the calcification on the shower head, stabilize the faucet so that it doesn't freely swing 4 inches from side to side when turning it off or on, clean the dust bunnies in the corners, and take down paper signs taped to the mirrors about how much a towel costs. Also! Maybe I could get a towel larger than a standard bathmat. Oh! And good news! You can hear all three of your neighbors at one time. So if you want to get any sleep you should bring a white noise machine. If you are wondering how long spilled food will stay on the walkway outside, the answer is: at least three days. If you are wondering where the ice machine is? So am I.",0
"There were 4 total people in the restaurant at 5pm on a weekday, and I guess now I know why. The happy hour deals weren't very broad (it only applied to 1 specific beer), the bartender seemed snotty and the food was bad. The ice cream sundae station they advertise was very small and the ice cream was mostly melting, even though it had just opened an hour earlier I think. It will be interesting to see what restaurant opens in this location next.",0
"Visited on June 29th.  Could not find a clean table, soft drink area was dirty and strew with depris, floor hadn't been swept for a long time, littered with food, napkins.  Will never go back!",0
"ABSOLUTELY terrible what has happened to me.  Send me a text and I will send you the photos of my damaged hair.  630 550-7297 *I went to Rebecca for hair coloring.  I was satisfied.  I needed a place I could trust after being spoiled for 30 years with the same gal in Chicago.  Well, I went to get a perm from her and she ruined my hair.  I had to ask for my money back and still gave a tip and all I was told was that there must be something wrong with me that this happened to me.  I went to three different professional and each of them told me to shave my head that no product can save it.  This kills me to write this for I understand that people make mistakes, but it is how we rectify them that separates us from the professionals to the amateurs.  I have had to have 4 pixis at 95.00 each and 8 scalp treatments to finally have a sense of hope that my hair is coming back healthy once again.  I have begged her practically to give me some kind of compensation.  I even went back to her for a color to be sure she understood she can pay me pack with services and she still tried to charge me.  I gave her a twenty tip and said NO MORE!!!",0
"That young Mexican girl working there has a lot to learn in life and at her job. I gave her a piece of paper with my Tmobile acct # so I could switch my phone to metro pcs. 15 minutes goes by after buying the phone and she now needed that #. I told her I gave it to her earlier, she said no. I said yes I did. She said no again and ""I'm 100% positive you didn't give it to me, you're wrong"" I'm thinking what??? Is she kidding me? So I thought because she was young and obviously doesn't know not to contradict customers, I just didn't want to take the time to ""school"" her. She didn't even try to look for it, but my husband went and look for it and it was on the desk where she left it! And then she just felt stupid I could see her demeanor but the worst part is that she didn't apologize! So I told my husband in Spanish that this Dumbass can't even apologize for her mistake. I know she heard me and I hope she learns from it. Go get some customer service training classes, stupid kid",0
"This Arby's is absolutely trash! I showed up at 9:10pm when their hours are posted til 10pm when they close. I get there and all the lights are off and one car at the window, there is a female employee there. I sit st the drive through for 5 minutes shouting ""hello!?"" With no response. I pull forward and the vehicle is still at the window with the employee standing right there. I will NEVER return to this pathetic excuse of a restaurant",0
"Worst service ever from a server named, Lisa. You'd think at a $30 buffet, some form of liquid would be brought to the table in under a half hour.

She shouldn't be working here. It's not even crowded...",0
"Update: Dave Jones came out again after this and they did not fix the problem and I hair another bill for the visit. I decided to have NAMI come out and look at all the shoddy work Dave Jones did.

"Came here on Valentine's day. had a horrible experience with the cashier, who didn't follow our basic instructions (pepperoni on top), then started arguing with my pregnant wife about the pizza. The cashier then decided to make a scene and start throwing things around the kitchen. Another member of the staff came by to apologize, but was very disappointed with the service. Another walk-in customer had to wait over an hour for their pizza, only to find out it was sitting on the counter the whole time. The cashier forgot to give it to them.I emailed Pizzaiolo about this incident and never got a reply back. Very disappointed, usually very good service and food from Pizzaiolo, I would avoid this location at all cost.",0
"Maybe they have better cooks past midnight, but me and my friends (all college guys) tried Gus' for lunch and regretted it. The pork was slimy, we managed half the pizza before considering leaving it in the parking lot. Afterwards we all had a great time in the restroom.Hopefully the midnight shift has less food poisoning, more deliciousness?",0
"Cold food,  items missing, bad attitude.  Very disappointed. Don't call them onion rings if they only have flakes",0
"Walked in the lobby and was grossed out by the smell. Trash all over the parking lot. Read the yelp reviews and opted to cancel reservation, which they did without asking questions. Don't be fooled - not suitable for business travelers.",0
"Used to be my favorite place but not anymore , The people work there is so rude when you eat they  stand around and glance  at you check on you see if you waste the rice , when we left me and my wife have to find the restroom, you can find better food somewhere else , don't come there if you have a baby and you try to bring a baby food or doesn't matter any kind of food for the baby they won't let you in , doesn't matter if you tell them your baby have to eat if the baby not eating you guy can't eat. They say sorry you have to go cant stay there with outside food baby",0
"Overall, all of Lazy Jane's establishments don't seem to have customer service as a priority.  Crappy and condescending service is the norm at Lazy Jane's, The Tip Top, and Mickey's.  As I read reviews, I don't seem to be the only person who thinks so.  Why does this seem to be a common thread, Lazy Jane?",0
"I called to schedule an estimate for a glass door replacement. The person who answered initially was courteous enough, and set up an appointment for the next day. The company never showed up to my house, and when I called about it they told me the tech had already been there. After that, no one answered, and I only got voicemail. Not awesome when you've got a broken door at your house!!",0
Service was horrid!  When a party calls with a reservation and you confirm said reservation they should not be told to either sit outside or wait for an additional thirty minutes before being seated.  (This is after a 20 minute wait past the reservation already.)  All food was either overcooked or undercooked.  Some meals were not even brought out until after other party members had already fisnished.  Trying to flag down a waiter for a refill on a water was nearly impossiable.  I realize that it is not the wait staff's fault but rather poor management.  In the future I will stick to a less pricey better tasting cajun option.,0
"Unfortunately, Amelia was very rude, walked up behind me as I was standing in line and said ""are you ready, come on"". I said ""come on where"" lol there are 3 registers open. She asked me ""can u read?"" (!?!?). I was the only one in line standing at the ""line starts here"" and I guess she assumed I should just walk up to the register. However, the last time I just walked up to the register an older lady w glasses who was also rude told me to wait back where it says the line starts here. Amelia told me more personal info than I needed to know and I told her to please just process my purchase. Sad because I spend a decent amount of time in this area and I like ur stores but will not be back to this one.",0
"*DISCLAIMER: I'm writing this review strictly from a third person point of view.  I did not eat nor attempted to eat anything off the Heart Attack Grill menu.  I did this solely should my friend cannot Yelp this place if he did not survive his meal.*With that said, I've heard crazy things about the Heart Attack Grill...and nothing on the positive side.  Though it's really up to the individual to come dine here, this place was pretty gimmicky and markets itself on unhealthy eating and radical indulgence.  I considered myself a very healthy eater so when my friend wanted to try out this place, I went along as moral support (and potentially an ambulance caller).So here we go: my friend weighed himself on the outside scale and coaxed me in.  We were ""greeted"" by this poor and very unhappy hostess that gave us a quick lowdown on how this place operates.  I went along with the campy hospital gown get-up and laughable wrist band.The place was very empty that night with only two or three other tables that were occupied.  We were seated to the far right of the restaurant and were given menus.  Prior to coming here I decided that I won't be eating anything here but to keep my friend company on his artery-clogging journey.  After a short while this super skinny rather ditzy blonde waitress with the classic Minnie Mouse squeak came over to take the order of a single bypass burger with flatliner fries.  If I were to point out anything positive here, it would be the rather entertaining music videos that were playing on the big screen.  The videos were from the 80's and kindly reminded me of my youth and stupidity.  On other screens, it showed news stories regarding the Heart Attack Grill and even how two people apparently ate themselves sick.  The place seemed proud of this ""achievement"".While waiting for the food to arrive, I noticed that other patrons were still waiting for theirs.  It was apparent that since it was a slow night, the cook might have decided to gather enough orders to make all the burgers all at once.  People at the other tables did seem restless.Finally the food arrive and what I saw was a hamburger with oversized buns and a side of very dark dirty looking fries.  I cringed when my friend took his first bite and asked for his opinion.  He replied he had better...which spoke volumes.  The fries themselves looked like they were fried in old reheated lard; very dark and flimsy.  While he ate, I just sat there in my hospital gown hoping nobody I know sees me.From the 3rd person point of view, the service here was pretty sucky.  Servers were seen gathering at one spot just conversing and joking around with each other.  Our waitress didn't really come over to check on us but just to leave off the bill.  Obviously the customers were not much of their concern.Just think: I gave up seeing a nudie show for this.  At least my friend survived...and never got spanked.",0
I had a terrible experience with the manager Lindsay. She was exceptionally rude and short towards me. On top of that she was not supportive of her own staff. I was attempting to make a exchange/ return for an online order. I had the receipt and order confirmation and she assumed I had no proof of the purchase and refused to put the credit back on my visa. The store clerk had asked for her help and Lindsay provided her with in correct info about reordering my item on line. Bottom line Lindsay was rude to me and her staff. Here is a pic of her so you can steer clear if she is present in the store. As for me never will I shop here again!!,0
"I had a very contrary experience with Carrie and it saddens me. Things started off well with gorgeous engagement photos and lots of communication. But as the wedding drew near I became quickly disappointed with her professionalism. There were problems with my wedding boudoir photos and what was sheer panic from me as the photos were supposed to be my future husbands wedding gift, Carrie was unsupportive and rude. She went as far as to send me nasty emails and blame me for things. I don't know if it's because Carrie is not married yet herself, but those of us who have lived through it know it to be one of the most stressful times in a woman's life and Carrie only made my experience more stressful. Several times I broke down in tears due to her lack of professionalism and attacking me. Of all my vendors I used for my wedding I was severely disappointed in Carrie. I even said to my future husband ""well, now I bet we never have good wedding photos"". We paid Carrie for everything- engagement, boudoir, rehearsal dinner, and wedding. I had to take the boudoir photos to walmart to print that was such a disaster! And the wedding photos themselves were lackluster, I thank god every day my husbands cousin is an aspiring photographer and we got some beautiful shots from him. Needless to say, some of her photos on her website look beautiful, but most my wedding photos look like I could have taken them myself. To this day I am uncertain if she even edited them, but by the time she got them back to me I was just happy to be done communicating with her. I will not be recommending her to anyone. Sadly disappointed.",0
So sad!! Food was cold and not well seasoned unlike the original location. The cook got upset that I nicely asked to get fresh tortilla because it wasn't warm. The other staff were nice. The only thing this place has going for them is there bottled coke! Sucks such a great rep the original place has and this location just ruined it for them!,0

I placed my drive through order at 10:57am. I was asked to wait at the pick stall which I thought was weird for only 3 breakfast sandwiches. At 11:15am my order still wasn't ready and now I was dealing with a frustrated toddler in his car seat. By 11:30 we had our food with no apology or acknowledgement of how long we waited. We were just another annoying customer. By the time we got home to eat at 11:40am our hash browns were still cold in the middle and our sandwiches were over cooked.  I know it's just McDonalds but you're still serving people food. If you don't want to work there then don't. Someone else would be more than happy to provide good service and good food.  I would steer clear of this McDonalds if you see all the parking stalls for pickup are full. That means you'll wait an eternity for subpar food.,0

"I read the reviews on google and yelp.  There were a handful of good reviews but most were either bad or mediocre - trust the bad reviews.  I was prepared to pay in advance (and tip in advance) based on the previous reviews.  This is definitely not the way I like to do things, but I sucked it up.  Upon entering, the facilities were very clean and organized so that made me feel like maybe some of the other reviews were too harsh.  I arrived for my 3:00 appointment, was escorted to my room, where I waited about 8 minutes for the massage therapist.  She started rubbing, not massaging but rubbing, my back.  She didn't use oils or massage lotions, only a sheet to rub my back with (yes, she rubbed me WITH A SHEET).  She was in the room 2-3 minutes, then left to talk to someone.  She returned and proceeded to rub my feet with a sheet.  She was in the room for another 2-3 minutes and left again.  I waited for 10 minutes and she never returned.  I changed clothes and asked for my money back.  They did return my money, but let me say... NEVER again.  Please, please don't go to this place.

"Go somewhere else.  This is a Verizon Retailer, not an actual Verizon store.  Very few phones on display.  It is a small storefront but feels more like a self-service kiosk.  Service is poor.  Staff is uninterested.Details:l Went there on Sunday, November 6th to upgrade 4 phones.  They had very few phones on display.  Asked about the new Google phone and they had to pull one from the back and charge it.  There we only two other customers in the store.  The best way  to describe the staff was 'uninterested'.  There were three sales reps working at the time.  We had a group of 6 adults with two infants and entered the store without any acknowledgement from the staff.  It's not like we came in without being noticed.We wanted to see the iPhone 7 Plus.  They didn't have one so we had to walk over to the Apple Store. Pretty pathetic considering the iPhone 7's are their most popular phones.When we returned, our sales rep was helping the only other customer in the store.  However the other two sales reps couldn't be bothered, even when WE tried to get their help.  I understand they work on commission but there is no excuse for 2 of 3 sales reps standing around doing nothing while customers are waiting.  We milled around for another 10 minutes before deciding to go to a 'real' Verizon store.Don't waste your time at this location. Go to an actual Verizon store.",0

"DONT EVER BUY A CAR FROM AUTO NATION!! They are dishonest. Now anyone who knows me knows that I am not one to say mean things about people and I am pretty easy going. I let most things just go, but I am so angry with this company and their lack of customer service and integrity. I just think people should know the truth and that these companies should not be able to get away with treating their customers so badly. I would like to share my story in hopes that it might help others not to be in a vulnerable situation like mine. I took my 370Z into AutoNation Nissan in Chandler to have my convertible top looked at because it was going down slow and when i came to pick it up they said it was in perfect shape and back to factory standards. As I was leaving, I tried to put it down and it was still having the same issues. So I told them to keep the car and fix it and i would come back tomorrow.  I then got a call from them the next day informing me that one of my brackets was broken and neither my Nissan Warranty nor my extended warranty would cover the repairs. Then they asked me if I was sitting down.  They then informed me that the cost for the part to repair my top was $17,000, yes you read it right Seventeen Thousand Dollars!!! That was just for the part.  It's pretty funny that the day before the top was perfect, but now the bracket was broken. My 7 year old granddaughter could see where the bracket had been broken when I brought it home after they broke it.  If she could see it right away why couldn't a trained auto technician do the same.  Hum, I think we all know what happened. ..they broke it!!! After spending months trying to talk to Auto Nation & Nissan and my lawyer sending them letters they still refuse to fix it.  I am angry with Nissan and I despise Auto Nation. I am not asking for the world , I am just asking them to fix what they broke.  Shame on both of them. At least Nissan had the class to respond to my letter, but Auto Nation, nope not a peep from them. If this is the way they do business, I nor any of you, should be subjected to their corruption. All I can hope for is that Karma will find them.  So the moral of this story is......DO NOT EVER BUY A CAR FROM AUTO NATION!!!",0
The worst experience. First of all Bald tall Manger is super nice and friendly but staff he hires seems like they hate there job specially girls short blonde and tall blonde omg No smile on there face always rude and cranky. Always tight on giving meat like they are trained to charge extra for one spoon of meat with an attitude wow seriously very disappointing. The meat you charging extra already dried up by sitting over hours. I am sorry girls if you loose your job over this but if you cut your attitude and put a smile on your face and greet customers and be generous on giving customers extra meat with no extra charge you can stay. Don't forget you are in food business and learn some manners from your boss. Dear Boss you better train your staff soon and make this place friendly otherwise you will be closing down soon too like your next door midwood smokehouse lol Not just the girls all the boys too they are stingy and always try to short on meat just to charge extra. Only this location Sisky YMCA in front of publix is the worst one. other locations I went omg they were super nice greet as soon as you walk in doors with a big smile like you are welcomed and give you extra meat at no extra charge and always talk friendly with a smile and always say come back and see us again and makes you feel like go again but not this location. Well I will not be coming back to you guys Goodluck,0

"Bad experience today. Had a nail in my tire. There was plenty of tread, but she gave me a series of false statements in hopes of selling me a new tire. Then, she quoted me $29.75 to plug the tire because ""We must replace the tire pressure monitoring system at the same time"". False again. I went to a nearby tire shop and had it fixed for $10 in 15 minutes. I won't go back. The store on Thomas Rd has always been good. I would avoid this Osborn location.",0
"In the past, having dinner at the restaurant (one of my favorites in the world) would grant you access to the club through a backdoor with no cover. I called and placed reservations, confirmed this was still their practice and they confirmed the $50 per person minimum spend. After finishing dinner the restaurant maintained the same policy until we came to the cashier girl for the club who said they would not honor it because it was the 'anniversary weekend'. No other options were given except paying full price even though we spend $$$ at the restaurant. Super rude and no budge or customer service at all. The service of this place has fallen heavily as well --the disrespectful and ultra unhelpful bouncers and front people almost make you wonder why you are paying money to go in and be treated like cattle.

We stood at the register waiting to order for a solid 5 minutes watching everyone cleaning straightening up we waited patiently figured maybe they're waiting on some high up to show up or something..... till we kept getting glares from a staff member that was behind the counter ignoring us I go closer to ask why noone is acknowledging we even exist but he comes out to floor sweeping so since everyone ignoring us I check the time it's about 1055 .... we start walking out(noone says a single word to us whole time even till completely left) as leaving I see on window hours says 11 a.m. so why the heck was the door opened before??? And why in the heck did everyone ignore us even existing they should have said something to us instead of leaving us standing there like morons!!!  You shouldn't have to  look at hours once you are standing at the register waiting to order!!!!! You don't walk into a grocery store oh but you can't buy anything till 10 minutes later just look till then!!!!! Absolutely horrible and not one person took the seconds to tell us not open for business when though door wide open!!!! Everyone in your staff ignored us and this is the one that completely blew me off when I tried asking what's going on why being ignored and walked out from behind the counter!!!!",0
"Pizza Isn't worth it. Super small and completely tasteless. Go to angelos. You get more bang for your buck and an actual pizza. Such a disappointment especially since they are right down the street. I am all for a mom and pop shop, but for almost no veggies on a veggie pizza and no sauce, literally no sauce, it wasn't worth it.",0
Very dissatisfied!  I feel like this gym is a rip off if you have kids and you actually want them to have any interaction or attention in the child care.  I feel like my 5 year old is too young to be on video games for any extended period of time.  I asked that he not be allowed on the computers.  there were about 10 in the childcare... Really?!... Is that necessary or a way to cut childcare costs by sticking kids in front of screens.  So when I came to pick them up on several occasions they were sad because there weren't any kids to play with because they were all on the computers or looking over another child's shoulder on a computer.  Sad!!!  They are certainly creating security for the gym by showing the kids how to sit on their butts while their parents workout.  I was told they make all the kids get up every 2 hours for a fifteen minute break!  Ridiculous.  The two childcare workers who were in the back barely smiled an didn't seem to care about engaging the kids at all.,0
"Based on the high reviews decided to come here.. First of all, I'm pregnant I was craving for a mojarra Frita (fried tilapia) with an agua fresca de piña.(pineapple drink) When it was time to order Guess what..?? She came by to ask what we wanted for drinks I asked for an agua fresca and she said we are all out... So I ordered a jarrito (which she said we only have mandarin). Waiting for the rest of my family to decide what they wanted to eat then the lady came back to ask us what we wanted to eat I ordered my mojarra, my husband a fried shrimp plate and my daughter a kids meal., you won't believe it.. 5 minutes later she comes back and tells me they are out of mojarras, I said ""WHAT"" both of my craving just got crushed!!! Never again coming here!!! Because I was super hungry I just order another thing.. I almost wanted to cry!!! I ordered what was closest to a mojarra. A fried red snapper..wow it was too salty that I could not eat it.. There goes my night.., way to go!! Still hungry and between what I told you guys what we ordered it was $47..",0

"Terrible! They do not do what the customer wants ....after all we are the ones paying the money for a service, I feel that if the owner does like you you get a nice nail set, otherwise you get whatever chip service at a very expensive price, you get a better service at a local casino spa for the same price, I will Never come back here again.Overprice.",0
"Oh man...where do I start? This had to be the worst dining experience of my life. We show up and it's a 25-minute wait for two. Okay, that's normal. But wait, you have to stand outside, and it was 109 degrees today. They had a canopy set up, gee thanks! But how about a glass of water while I wait? Not here! I'm so glad I had a little bit of iced tea left in my cup from AJ's this morning.So we get seated; get this, outside under an enclosed wooden canopy! Who does that to their patrons in Phoenix in the summer? They had misters, but they were nowhere near us. They had a fan mounted on the patio roof, but it blew right over the top of us and did no good. I think they sell portable evaporative coolers at Home Depot. That would have been nice!So I'm looking at the menu and trying to decide what I want to eat when I see the waitress bring out an order to a table near us. I'm a bacon freak and I love it extra crispy. The order she brought out had bacon and it was cooked to perfection! Things were starting to look up. When she set the small plate down in front of the little girl, I didn't think anything of it. It was an adequate portion...for a nine year old.  We'll return to this in a moment. So the waitress takes our order and I excuse myself to use the washroom and wash my hands. So I ask where the washroom is, thinking it's inside. I was politely told it was located in the back...As in, go outside, around the back, and there you'll see them. As I walk around the corner, I suddenly feel as if I'm entering a washroom at a grungy service station. The washrooms weren't clean, weren't air conditioned, and the urinal didn't flush. Can you see where this is going?So back to my seat, our order arrives, and guess what, it's the same size as what I had earlier thought was a kid's portion.  I'm so glad it was hot and I wasn't super hungry.So how was the food? Well, the eggs were runny, the hash browns were completely overdone on the outside, but still raw on the inside, and the bacon...well, let's just say that a couple of Band-Aids and that pig would be out wallerin' around in the mud again.I'll admit. I should have done a little research on my part before eating here, but I seriously doubt I'll go back. At least Denny's is consistent and has clean bathrooms.  I'll give the place one star because at least they had two cool photos of Marilyn Monroe in the Men's Room.",0
"We've gone to THIS location weekly for more than 6 years and it has been getting worse and worse over the past year. Now it seems that 'when convenient' neither of the ladies can speak English. We arrived to an EMPTY store and both ladies were PREMAKING well over a dozen sandwiches (it was 11 a.m.) When I asked to order a sandwich one lady simply looked at me, took off her gloves and walked out to her car in the parking lot!!! The other lady just shrugged... I again asked to order a single sandwich and the remaining lady just pointed to all of the half prepped sandwiches covering the entire counter and pointed to the other employee out at her car!!! After well more than 5 minutes the parking-lot-lady returned, did NOT wash her hands but did put on new gloves and asked what I wanted. When she was cutting the sandwich bread (I wanted a 6"") she was facing the other lady and I was being given a half that was no where near 6"" so I asked for the other half she had just cut off!!! She ignored me and started to make my sandwich so I asked again waving my hands and saying that I wanted the other/larger half and she shrugged and kept working. After my THIRD request I told her to keep the sandwich and I went to Port O Subs. I came back in and asked when the store owner/manager would be in and got another shrug. Try some place else!!!",0
"Service is terrible, they took over 30 minutes to get us 5 tacos which were not worth the wait. Also, the people at the counter were extremely rude which made matters worse.",0
Bartending staff is unfriendly and inattentive. More interested in standing around talking than serving customers. Food is overpriced and generic too.,0
WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! Like other yelpers nothing but excuses!!!! Took half hour for drinks messed up on our order then proceeded to argue with us about it! I am a server and they should know better!!!!!!! I highly reccomend avoiding this place do not waste your time!,0

"showed up solo on Wednesday night around 6:30, the place was slow. Wanted to do the AYCE, but they said I would have to pay for two people. Decided to order BBQ a la carte, with a single order they would have cook in back, instead of grilling the meat (BBQ) it was steamed. The meat had no flavor, chewy, and over cooked. ... and the Banchan, they only brought out 3 types, of the 7 types they had (noticed them upon cashing out)",0
"So here we thought we found our new home for AYCE sushi yumminess, until this past Sunday. We came for dinner, we waited about10 minutes for a table for four though, in plain view there were tables/seats available to accommodate us, no biggie we waited patiently. There were only two servers, we rolled with the tide and practiced patience for i.e. water refills and order taking.The defining moment for us was...my husband paid the bill with plastic, our daughter left paper for the tip, she placed the tip at the inside of the table and not in the check holder. As we walked out, I heard the male server open the door and say something, I didn't hear what he said, however my son did. My son asked, ""did you hear what he said? I said, ""no"". My son heard the male server open the door and said ""are you f@*king kidding me?"" I presume he opened the check holder and saw 0 on the tip line of the signed check.My son went back into the restaurant and confronted the male server, who of course denied saying anything.Though it's a further distance away, we will go back to making Sumo Sushi our home  for AYCE.",0
"The vegetable noodle soup had NO flavor was really bland and the beef broth had a very funky smell. The pork egg rolls were average and the paper wrap rolls had brown lettuce and were very bland with no flavor as well. They also had lunch meat turkey in the wrap which I have never seen before. Was not very impressed , will not be re-ordering from this place.",0
The Dj is straight up terrible. The worst music possible for a night out. Did I mention they have allegations of drugging peoples drinks. Way too much country music.,0

"I have been a customer  of lowes for  years.  I spent a lot of money of appliances and materials at your location on Washington.    Today I had to make a return and their were several people in line on one person with pink hair.   The lady helped another guy and I was in line mind you.   I went to the manager and had him return my items and purchased what I needed.The store needs two people at the return desk, and bring back the people who are friendly.   I know one think when the lady with pink hair is behind your return counter or any where in your store I will not have her wait on me.",0
"8:30 am and The restaurant was disgusting crumbs everywhere and all the tables, receipts on the floor and there is still trays and wrappers on all the tables. you would think that it was late at night after a rush but it was just the start of the day. It took 14 minutes for me to get my two coffees, two drinks, one croissant and one cookie. All foods that were already prepared and I don't understand why it took too long. The manager was not in uniform. No one greeted me or anything. They didn't seem apologetic to their service when I mentioned that my order was taking too long.",0
"I am extremely upset by the level of care my kitten received at MVS. If my kitten were a human, MVS' treatment would constitute malpractice. Potentially because of their actions, my kitten may not survive. At a minimum, I have to put my kitten in very expensive intensive care ($1000+) for the next 24-48 hours as the condition went too long without proper treatment.Here's the full story. My boyfriend first took my then 15 week old kitten in on Saturday, July 16th. A male doctor (I do not know his name) prescribed an antibiotic for an upper respiratory infection. Fine. I have no problem with the treatment during this visit.Over the following week, my kitten's respiratory symptoms worsened. Instead of just coughing, he also starts wheezing. He almost completely stops playing. On Friday, July 22nd, I therefore take him back in to MVS and off antibiotics per the instructions on the package. On that visit, my kitten saw Dr. Bates who seemed to think he had improved and could wait to see a regular vet with whom I had an appointment the following Wednesday. Dr. Bates mentioned he likely needed to be dewormed again but that was it. No concern about the lack of improvement in his respiratory symptoms at all. No additional medication or treatment prescribed. No concern that he had not gained any weight (this is apparently a red flag with kittens).I was still very concerned as he was wheezing a lot by Saturday, July 23rd and not playing at all. I thus did my best to get an appointment with a regular vet ASAP. The best I could do was to get him into a vet on Tuesday afternoon. The regular vet is ALARMED almost immediately once she sees him. Not only has he got a severe pneumonia, he's about half the weight he is supposed to be for his age. She explains that his best chance for SURVIVAL is to go into an oxygen chamber. That's where he is now.It is possible that my kitten's pneumonia is being caused by an underlying condition that is not treatable. We are still figuring out whether that's the case but, obviously, that is not the vet's fault. However, I feel MVS had an obligation to do a more thorough exam of my kitten and explain the potential situation to me. I am angry that they instead chose to just ignore the symptoms and tell me he was fine. I did not know that he was underweight and that a failure to gain weight in a kitten is quite so big a deal as it apparently is. They should have noted that and been concerned. Just shooing him out the door is completely unacceptable.Taking my kitten in the second time was worse than not having taken him in at all. Had they said they were unwilling to see him a second time, I would have taken him to a different emergency vet who would have acknowledged that he was not doing OK.",0
"The Jcpenny Salon there service is horrible!! Millie, Justin nail tech/hair dresser, Melissa are all very rude people. When I called to make an appointment earlier today I had the intention of getting a gel mani n pedi. But when I got there the equipment was broke I was forced to get a regular one with the normal polish. Pissed!!! Like have your equipment working properly. Then I get there and she's mad at me for not asking if they did gel or for not telling them on the phone that's what I wanted!! I said I wanted a mani n pedi but who cares if it's gel or not!! Like money is money! Then and this is Melissa by the way!!! She gives me to this guy named Justin who is just showering me with compliments. Who does my mani!! HE MAKES MY THUMB BLEED!! The pictures are gross!!! He keeps sanitizing his hands like I'm dirty or something!! Every five minutes he's pressing the top to get more hand sanitizer. My cuticles are sore and he polishes them so now they are burning profusely!!! He makes me sign a waiver cause he sucked so bad!! They all are like a group of small minded people. Who get off on hurting others!!! I came home in tears!!! Never going back I want to speak to the manger n I want a refund!!! Or something!!! Wish I could upload a picture. Worst service ever! And my nails are horrid!!! And my face he plucked it for hours!!! So unfair treatment. They all need to be replaced!!!",0
Spend all day being pestered and pressured to set up and appointment. We only wanted to buy a very specific van so we made it clear this is the stock number we wanted. We arrived to find that that very same van sold that night after being listed and on their lot for 20ish days. We had already spent our precious time doing all our own financing threw our bank so that it was not a waist of time. Total bait and switch!! The person we had spent all day being pressured to meet up with was not even their!! Total joke and waist of my family's time.,0

"Over-promise and under-deliver.My wife and I have excellent credit history, I am employed, no criminal record, never declared bankruptcy, etc.  I chose RoundPoint for their rates after the loan officer, Nathan Cook assured me that the company was now closing loans on time, within a month.  I explained that I did not have my 1040 form for my 2011 tax return but had the IRS transcript, which the IRS makes available for things such as mortgage applications.  I submitted all of the information in October, including the transcript for the 2011 tax return with explanation that the IRS could provide a copy of the actual form but that it would take up to 75 days.  On November 27, RoundPoint wrote that underwriting had reviewed my application (The process began on October 2, with assurances from Nathan Cook that we could close within a month), and still required the form 1040.  I asked what information was required that was not included in the IRS-provided transcript, and STILL noone has answered that question.  After 2 more weeks of deliberation, RoundPoint denied my loans because it would take too long to provide the photo copies of the actual 1040 form on which I filed my 2011 taxes.The company has been a huge waste of time, during which interest rates have increased, and they still have not been able to explain what information I was not able to provide.My email to RoundPoint in response to their declining our loan:Dear Nathan:  My wife and I are surprised and disappointed, both at the time it has taken to process our loan, and RoundPoint's decision to withdraw the loan as evidenced by Erin Schweitzer's forwarded email dated December 16, 2013.  My surprise is rooted in the fact that from the outset -- indeed, from our initial conversation in early October -- I explained we only had a transcript for our 2011 tax return.  I reiterated that point when uploading documentation to the RoundPoint website on October 7.  In emails to Stephanie Wacaster on October 24 and again on October 29, I explained the situation yet again in the course of submitting additional material.  To date we have submitted 55 separate documents detailing our personal and financial information.  This is in addition to the 100+ pages of authorizations and disclosures we signed and uploaded for each of the two loan applications.  The quantity of information provided is extensive.  And yet, despite having ALL of the information from our 2011 tax return (from the IRS-provided transcript, so its accuracy is assured), our loan applications are being cancelled 12 weeks into the process because I no longer have a copy of the return filed for 2011.  This cancellation occurs after you assured us by email that the loans would be closed within a month.  To date, you have been unable to tell me what if any specific information from our 2011 return you are lacking or that I have been unable to provide. If the requirement to have the actual form 1040 form from one's tax return is an external requirement (State or Federal law, for example), it is understandable that you must deny the loan.  However, RoundPoint should have been able to communicate this requirement to us at the beginning of the process; again, I discussed this with you and with others handling our applications. If, on the other hand, the requirement for the form 1040 is an internal one imposed by RoundPoint or the underwriter, the denial of our loans represents a timorous approach by individuals unable or unwilling to evaluate objective information and make a logical decision. In either case, you have wasted more than a month of our time.",0
"By far the worst experience of my life. I had gone into the office and worked with Francine with my apartment search. She was nice and addressed my concerns. Although she complained about her coworkers and a fellow apartment renters child being sick and all the girls in the office joked about who could be the bigger B**ch to this lady. All that should have been red flags but, I gave Francine the benefit of the doubt. The floor plan of the apartment I wanted was not available at the time. I was showed the smaller 2 bed/2 bath and was told ""I would love the large floor plan"". So I went in the office and told Francine I want to rent the next Large Floor plan you have toward the end of March (as my current rent was paid through March). I was told the apartment I wanted would open the end of Feb and would go fast. So I decided I will hold that one and put $100 down and have Francine run my credit (I have GREAT credit so of course no issue there). My move in date was 3/7/14 over two weeks away. I we planned on doing a walk through the day before we move in just to make sure everything was perfect. Fast forward to the day before we move in.. my fiance and I head over to the apartments for our scheduled walk through. We arrive and another lady advises us the apartment is no where near ready but will be ready for us to move in the next day. I tell her I have a 5 month old and would really like to see the unit prior to move in and it is pushing it close if there are any issues. She said the unit would be fine and would show us the unit the next morning. I ask her for her head supervisor and she provides Dana's phone number. I contact Dana and explain my situation and am asked ""what I would like""?!.. no I'm sorry...NOTHING. Long story short I am advised my unit will be move in ready to go first thing in the morning if not there is a back up unit that is move in ready. So the next morning we show up for our walk though and are advised Francine is walking the apartments. 25 minutes later I ask if Francine is the only person who is able to show an apartment and am advised anyone can show an apartment. Just then Francine walks in and is a total different person. She is very rude, condescending and a complete B**tch! I ask if we are able to see our unit and she says.. ""I know you spoke with Dana and to be Frank your unit is not ready and I can not show it to you could you come back at noon?"". I then ask about the alternate unit and she says ""that unit is not ready either"". I ask if we could see that unit and she says ""I guess I will meet you there"" luckily Dana told me the number of that apartment. As I walk into that unit I just start crying, it is a mess... patchwork carpet, the screen needs replacing, the drawers and cupboards are a wreck there are stains and dead cockroaches, the bathroom needs new tile work, new paint was needed.. how am I supposed to let my son crawl around this apartment. I already switched my address over, turned on utilities, rented and packed a uhaul truck and had family come into town to help us move. Francine CLEARLY knew the issues of this apartment and said she would send someone right over to fix everything. I ask Francine if we were to switch apartments could they hold my mail from the other apartment.. she said ""of course"". She then says she will meet us back at the office so we can decide what we want to do. When we arrive at the office we ask if we could get our money back as this whole process was a mess and we would like to think about our options at this time. Francine says ""Dana said she would refund you if that is what you decide"". We tell her we would like a refund. I call Dana and leave multiple voice mails (which were never returned) I then call Crystal creek and ask for a supervisor who is extremely rude and has no remorse for what we have gone through trying to rent an apartment from them. She said it would be illegal to hold any mail for me and that it was inappropriate of me being frustrated. This issue is still ongoing.",0
"If pushy, upselling service is what you desire, this is the place. Not only will you enjoy continuously having to deny the barrage of questions for more food or wine before you're finished,  you'll have the pleasure of a cursing, snorting, server parading back and forth from the kitchen to your table every 5 minutes. This is a nice environment and $$$ menu, with service and food of a Round Table Pizza chain.I left never wanting to return to this place,  again, and a little upset from the overall experience.After reviewing other posts, we experienced the same wine service overcharge when ordering the house wine as Coleen C. mention in her review, posted 4 days ago. The waitress refunded our money, only after I expressed my discontent.",0
"Exactly why personal injury attorneys have a bad reputation. Went online and was connected to a called center woman who wasn't a lawyer and gave her all my information regarding the accident. Put me on hold to ""talk to someone"" only to come back and tell me they wouldn't represent me because I had waited two weeks to call them after the accident. I explained the two week delay was due to recovery and trying to find a good firm and she said too bad. Very concerning at the lack of concern towards clients.",0
"This place is SO lame! I have been to Benihana in San Francisco and our chef put on a helluva show..so I was excited to find one in Scottsdale. Sadly, this experience was NOTHING like my previous visit. Our waiter never said please or thank you and obviously had something other than work on his mind as he slammed down bowls of soup and salad. Our chef ""Kevin"" came out and was suffering from a lack of enthusiasm and a VERY dirty chefs coat. He didn't put on a show, had no sense of humor and when he did it was forced and not funny. The ""big"" shrimp were overcooked and the steak was flavorless. The one positive was that the chicken fried rice was delicious! But, overall I was totally underwhelmed and disappointed. Wasn't worth it. You come for the show, the food is second and both sucked.",0
Was looking for a place to eat with my mother as we are staying at Caesars. Walked up to the hostess stand and asked for a menu. The hostess looked at me and ignored my request. Okay fine. I went and got my mother since I guess being 19 they chose to not take me seriously. My mom walked up and got the same treatment. That's not how you treat (would be) paying customers. Needless to say we continued our search for food.,0
"During a recent visit I entered the dinning room and was seated with two of my children. There was only one other occupied table. We waited for quite a long time for service and nobody came to the table. Another couple came into the dinning room and sat near us. They were immediately waited on. When I asked the hostess for any type of service, she was disinterested in helping me. Unfortunately we left. It is really a shame that an area restaurant I've supported for years suddenly doesn't seem to care about its patrons.",0
"Absolutely LIVID. Do NOT go here. In January I brought in a jacket of my husband's. He'd broken up a scuffle between our two dogs and it had gotten dirty and a small tear. They said since the jacket had leather accents and pockets they had to send it to a leather specialist. No problem. I get the jacket back, and it shrunk. Now that's bad enough for an irreplaceable jacket he got on the trip of a lifetime, but what happened after takes the cake. I brought it back and the girl was very apologetic and said she'd let the owner know so he could contact me. I wait weeks. Nothing. I stop back in. She's very apologetic and says she'll really get on him. I wait weeks. Nothing. I stop back in and talk to the nice lady who, at this point doesn't know what to do as he's avoiding me. She suggests I call before they open at 6 because that's the only time he's sure to be there, otherwise he's in and out.  I do so. The phone goes unanswered. I try several times over the following months. Nothing. TODAY I finally came in and demanded the jacket back. That's 10 MONTHS. I've never seen such a pathetic unprofessional establishment.",0
"What a joke! Food looks great but the waitress was RUDE. They did not acknowledge us so when we finally approached she hits us with ""I won't be able to help you for another 40 minutes"". Her reasoning because they had a big party (which actually all had their food already) She wasn't at all remorseful about not being able to give us good customer service she just smiled and said sorry can't help.

"I used to honestly LOVE coming to this AMC, but not as of late. First of all, during Avengers: Endgame, during the final scene, our theater's sound cut out. We were then told to evacuate and given a free movie ticket, even being promised our food would be refunded. We got two free tickets, but when asked about the food, we were asked to leave and the manager even threatened to have the POLICE remove us, even though we weren't doing anything wrong. (Manager by the way, didn't get her name, but was a short, dyed blonde haired girl with glasses.) Another complaint I have is about the Hispanic woman, (also did not get her name because AMC refused to give her name to me. Bigger woman with reddish hair, accent I'm assuming a Hispanic background) who ran the ticket counter. She was very nasty to my boyfriend and I both times we have been there together, and we are millennials, so we are polite and understanding when it comes to mistakes and what not. But there was no reason to treat us the way she did. She was extremely nasty and talking over us, treating us with absolute disrespect.Lastly, the bathrooms in this theater are DISGUSTING. Lack of toilet paper and supplies. Nobody seems to bother to clean it, as you can see in the pictures below. Do not come to this theater. You're absolutely better off going to Cinemark, Regal or quite frankly ANYWHERE else. Disgraceful.",0
So disappointed!! Weve loved this clubhouse.....until today. Beautiful saturday morning and we decided to take our 3 kids to play basketball.

Our last visit the I had the soup and salad bar and I'm really not sure what meat was in the beef vegetable soup-- it was square and grayish and mostly cabbage for the vegetables, even my dad said that was awful and he never complains. I know I'll be back because of my dad but I try my best to go anywhere else.",0

"Run to a different company.  Century Link has no concept of customer service.   Unfortunately you need to give at least one star for a posting or this would be 0 stars.  Anytime you need them you will be on hold and passed form department to department with no accountability.  Once they are on site you will find that if it is anything more than connecting the 2 wires for phone service it will take a subcontractor to resolve.  This is when you will start hearing ""this is not my job"" and someone else will need to be called in.  This delay could be as long as 120 days if something such as a new phone line needs to be buried.   Keep in mind that there service is centralized so no matter where you live you will get the same inept attitude and poor response.  If you have them now you should download an app and check your internet speed.  If your line is what they call ""unstable"" century link will cut your speed without telling you OR fixing it.  My 20 Mbyte was running less than 5 and after I called to complain a person said it had been ""unstable"" for 2 months and that they would turn the speed back up now that I called. Numerous other issues with every facet of service from installation to maintenance.   Gave them numerous opportunities but ""it wasn't their job"" to provide any type of reasonable service. I am now with COX.  All has been done above and beyond what was promised so far.  50Mbyte download internet speed is often running at 60Mbyte.",0
"My husband and I have been pleased with our past experiences with Auction Nation.  Most recently, we bid on an item and a new location for us, Tempe, AZ, and are very disappointed.  We understand the risks involved when purchasing items from this site.  We know that it is possible for a part to be missing or broken but were willing accept that risk for the possibility of a good ""deal"".  What we do expect is for the items that we purchase to be usable. We purchased a patio set (couch, 2 chairs, stools and table) about a week ago.  We picked it up on a Monday but were unable to put it together until the following weekend.  It was then that we realized that we were not given our complete order.  We have a table, a couch with no cushions, pieces of chairs and no stools. We called the company because of the oversight and were told that since we did not contact them within their 24-hour window, that we didn't have any options.  They can't find our missing boxes and will not allow us to return the unusable item for a refund.  I spoke with the ""owner"" of Auction Nation on the phone and, after a long conversation, he conceded to giving me $100 back for fees.  When I continued to plead my case he basically said that I could take that or nothing and kept repeating his 24 hour policy.  I feel cheated!",0
"I ordered for pickup on DoorDash around 8am. When I arrived to pickup my order they did not have a receipt on my order and the man working (in his 50s, short, and grumpy) yelled ""what is it?"" To me in the rudest tone. I was so shocked he would talk to a customer like that. I didn't think he was talking to me because of how rude he was. He then turned around and repeated himself and practically threw the food at me. I am discussed and will never be returning unless he is fired.",0
"I ordered a set for fathers day, with a very nice looking folding cutting board and cheeses with some delicious looking crackers. When my dad received and sent me the picture. I was so dissapointed every single item was replaced for a cheaper looking one except the wine. Cheap looking not folding cutting board. Random crackers and the cheeses were replaced with cheese spreads. What cheese lover likes cheese spreads. I felt so bad and dissapointed. I called and messaged many times until i was able to talk to a lady she agreed to send the correct items after i sent her a pic of the crap i got. Needless to say the items never arrived and all my messages have been ignored. This fraudulent company belongs to infamous guy called loren dortos famous for operating miltiple dodgy businesses. This is what my reseach got me. Do not order from here. Its a scam!!!!!!!",0
"This place is a joke, would give it a negative rating if I could. I'll keep this review short. The food was disgusting,  salsa was brought to the table in plastic 'to go' cups and looked like it just came out of a jar. We had been here before but decided to give it a second chance. The first time we were here the food was bland and drowned in sauce and sugar. Nothing authentic about the place. We were seated and our waitress came to our table. She was in her 40's and looked miserable. She didn't greet us, just asked us what we wanted to drink. My boyfriend asked if their were any drinks made without tequila on the menu, and the waitress reply was, ""I don't know, look, it's my second day. They have a full bar so I guess they have something back there.' Then she just walked away. I looked at my boyfriend in shock and asked him if that really happened. The waitress came back a second later and asked us if we were ready to order. She was very blunt, very rude, and very pissed off sounding. No smile,  no introduction of her name. We asked again if she could help us with information about the menu and she just said she didn't know, then again walked away. It was so weird. We decided to just leave before ordering anything. Totally turned off by the food and the service. Save your time and money, go somewhere else. Anywhere else.",0
"All i can say is this place has the WORST service ever!! Couple days ago, my boyfriend and I decided to eat here because it was close to Leelee and we were lazy to drive anywhere far. So when we were finished eating, I got up to pay for our meal. A Vietnamese lady at the cash register whispered to me saying that she needs to greet the customers that sat down at the table behind me, and since she cant do two jobs at once so she was wondering if i could do it for her, but luckily one of the waitresses came and said that she got it. I was surprised and couldn't believe she asked me that.. I came here to eat, not to do your job. Then later while I was signing the receipt, she told me that I look pretty and that if her son was here, she would hook me up with her son. She said that while my BOYFRIEND was sitting RIGHT THERE! After my boyfriend heard what she said, he was so pissed off. How could you say that when someone's boyfriend is right there?! How stupid can you be?!?! I felt so uncomfortable and not happy, so i decided not to give them any tip. When my boyfriend and I started leaving and walking out the door. She went to the door and asked us loudly ""Were you guys not happy with our service?"" and I told her that your service was ok since they didn't do much. She replied, ""because you guys didnt give us any tip!"" We were shocked and wanted to curse her out, but at the fact that she's an adult I didn't want to cause any drama. That was EXTREMELY RUDE of her! Where's your manners, lady?! Did your mother teach you about manners when you were young?! Here's the funny part.. she knows that im Vietnamese. We speak the same language, but she decided to speak English just so that everyone in the restaurant could understand her. Anyways, we will never come back to this place.. since we live close to this area, I'll make sure to warn anyone that goes here about how terrible this place is. Whoever is reading this, I'd recommend that you guys should try out Pho Saigon (at alma school rd) or Pho Vietnam (at Warner rd..it's close to Walmart).  They have way better service than this crap. LOL",0
"I was so disappointed in this place! Went to Vegas with Bear and we went to this location because we wanted Tapas and it was fairly close to the strip. The place is dark and cozy and the service is pretty nice. But the food was terrible. Absolutely godawful. We ordered the stroganoff on fries. The fries were great but the stroganoff was with ground beef and had a really thin broth like sauce which they had been very stingy with. Stroganoff usually comes with a creamy sauce and I thought they fries were gonna be covered with them but nah. Still this was the least terrible, can I say that? I don't want to say the best. We ordered some sort of dumpling that came looking like a Pirozhki. The crust was nearly burnt, super crunchy and inside was just a very firm and rubbery meetball, no sauce, no seasoning, nothing. We ordered the Lamb chop lollipop and we got two really big lamb chops, barely seasoned, the texture was all wrong. We ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce. We got 5 pieces of hard rubbery shrimp, swimming in a sour lemon sauce. Even though the dishes were very very small, we didn't finish a single one. We didn't finish the shrimp, the second dumpling was left untouched, the lamb chops we're left, the only thing we ate we're the fries. Never again!!",0
"In regards to my original review, I am very displeased. I originally had nothing but nice things to say about Martins as it seemed they genuinely did well the first couple times I went there. I too thought they were honest and did good work despite their sky rocket prices. I had come in last summer due to problems with my A/C blowing hot air. For as long as I have owned my car  I have always had problems with it blowing hot air every June. I use to take it to Gabs as they would usually recharge and send me on my way. Since I had recently started using Martins I decided to take it there instead for my A/C problem. Martins told me that there was absolutely nothing they could do for me and that it wasn't even capable of holding a charge for 5 mins because it was leaking out at such an enormous rate. They told me they would not even try to charge it.They did however, tell me they could replace my compressor, filter dryer, and expansion valve for $1600 and that this was the only way it would ever work again. They didn't even attempt to help me in any way and sent me back on my way 1 hour away from home in June with a small child and no A/C. In the end, I got hustled and lost $800 and am now stuck with a brand new $500 compressor in my closet that I am unable to return. The fanciest part of the whole thing is that low and behold I'm STILL using the same old compressor in my car, the one from last summer (1 year ago) that Martins said would never hold a charge again! I haven't been back since and I will not be ""trusting"" Martins anymore.",0
Worst customer service waited in line for half an hour! And when I finally had made it to the register the lady there ask cash or credit I said cash then she says oh the line is over there and the line was long! Everyone of your employees there is slow!,0
Avoid CenturyLink at all costs! This service is garbage.In 4 calls over the last 3 days they haven't been able to even verify my account in less than 20 minutes in order to let me tell them why I called. This is both using their live chat and by calling them.I paid extra to purchase their modem and I'm on my 2nd hardware failure with it this week.This company is horrible - their service is horrible - I highly recommend you find any suitable alternative by any means necessary.,0

"We went to this restaurant last night and this was the worst exspirence ive had in a while. We went to dinner and had a corner table. We were there for 15 min before. Someone asked us if we've been helped. Then we getbtomorder about 10 min after we get out drinks. Then we order and its took over 30 min to actually get our food. We ordered the 2 for 25$ our food came out cold and my child's grilled cheese came out burnt. The waiter didnt refill out drinks while we were eating dinner and since the 2 for 25 comes with desert the waitress was disappointed that we were eating dessert at the restaurant. This was a horrible exspirence, I wont go back for quite a while.",0
"I brought my family of five to golfland. We played golf and there was a thousand leaves all over the course. Before we were going to leave we decided to get some shakes and some cheese sticks and we were waiting for at least 20 minutes. Finally we got our shakes, but they forgot our cheese sticks so we just asked for a refund. Once we tasted the shakes we wanted to return them they were so bad. They hardly mix the ice cream and its run by a bunch of kids. But the laser tag was very fun.",0

"So so so horrible I will tell you why. I play at the casino all the time and get food comps. So I receive 150 dollars I food comp. I had to order my food at the bar. The young blonde hair lady with the glasses was horrible. First she ignored me and serving her host there was like 4 people at the bar ordering drinks. She didn't even come up and say I'll be with you just a moment, but in stead rolled her eyes at me. Waited 30 mins to finally get to order food. So I place a huge order. Came back serval time to see if my food was ready and she was like the cooks are mad at me and it'll come out. I kept seeing people go by and and getting there food first. Thought that she forgot to put in my order. I went back again to see if it's ready it's been 3hrs. I'm not kidding by the way. They are about to close. I asked for the manager, and waited again. So I played bj and see how it goes. Took the manager 40 mins to see me to resolve issue. So they came up with a plan for the next time I come I have two entree, appetizer, and free dessert on them. I felt that the waitress/ bartender was discriminating and rude. Wow such horrible service. Never been treated like that. So if you see her don't take any orders from her. The food was overall pretty ok.",0
"I booked Trendy Maids for a move-in deep clean service for my home in the beginning of February.  The booking process was easy enough through the Trendy Maids website.  The maids were scheduled to come to my home at 7:30am and they showed up on time.  Since this was a move-in cleaning, I wasn't actually present in the home when they arrived.  I had a painter in the home when they arrived who had already been in my home for the past 10 days whom I trusted to let the maids in. The week prior to booking, I had new carpeting installed on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the home (including the stairs to both the 2nd and 3rd floors) which cost me over $10,000.  When I arrived at the home at 7:40, I immediately noticed orange staining on my carpet stairs.  I asked the painter what may have caused it, and he shrugged his shoulders.  I went upstairs to introduce myself to the maids who had begun the cleaning service in the third floor bathroom.  I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary right away as I was speaking directly with one of the two maids to show her what I was hoping they could focus on with the cleaning service.After my introduction, I went back down to the first staircase and again noticed orange staining on my brand new carpet.  It dawned on me that if it hadn't come from my painter, it could have only come from one other place - the maids.  I went back up to the third floor and noticed that one of the maids had tracked a reddish-orange mud in on her shoes which was now all over my bathroom floor.  This meant that she walked all the  up my first set of carpeted stairs, through a long carpeted hallway, up a second set of carpeted stairs, and through a carpeted room to get to the bathroom she was currently cleaning.  Despite basically using my entire home as her welcome mat, her shoes STILL had left multiple orange tracks all over my bathroom floor.  I encourage you to note the pictures I've attached which show this bathroom floor staining. I was furious.  I just had new carpet installed and she tracked orange staining mud through my entire home.  I asked the two maids to leave as if they couldn't be trusted to respect my home, I didn't want them there.  She said ""It's ok, I clean"" in broken English and began following me around the home.  I asked her again to leave and she just followed me around.  It became obvious that she didn't understand English, so I pointed to the door and asked her to leave.  She went upstairs (which I assumed was to grab her supplies) and instead returned with the other maid so that they could both proceed to follow me around.I finally called the Trendy Maids office and asked them to get their maids out of my home.  I explained what had happened, and the office receptionist simply said ""I'll try"" (to my request to get them out of my home).  I waited ten minutes (with the two maids following me around the whole time) and called the front office back.  I advised that if they weren't out in the next ten minutes, I'd call the cops to have them removed.  The receptionist then conveniently called the head maid and got them out.  I asked the receptionist to have a manager call me back because one wasn't available when I called.  She said she'd have him call me as soon as he was available.  Keep in mind this was around 8am.  I heard nothing from them, so at 10am I called again and was told the manager wasn't available.  The receptionist said she'd have him call me.  I tried calling twice more around 1pm and 4pm and nobody answered.  To date (more than a week and a half after this awful experience), a manager has not called me back.Since I couldn't speak with anyone to request a refund of the prepaid cleaning service that I didn't obviously use, I ended up having to request a chargeback through my credit card to get the funds back.  Luckily they sided with me in my case and immediately credited the funds.  I still plan on filing a small claims court case against Trendy Maids for the carpet cleaning that I plan on having done once I'm moved in and settled in.  For now, I've personally spot treated the areas where the mud was most visible in an effort to ward off permanent staining.  Obviously I don't recommend this company.  I recommend quite the opposite - stay as far away from them as you can.  Between the $10,000 carpet staining, broken English, weird shadowing of me, no manager contact, and ultimate charge-back, Trendy Maids was simply terrible.",0
"This location was convenient for me because its near my job. But I will never come back to this location again. I came in to purchase 2 rear tires. I made my appointment online because I hate being haggled with the purchase of additional services. Also online you can opt of out things they don't mention in the store, it's just automatically included unless you say something. So with my new tires, I removed the option to replace the tpms sensors. Because i'd already spoken with my dealership who said it is not necessary to replace these with every set of new tires and this was a new car. So I arrive and tell the guy that I had an appointment. He asked me my name and proceeds to ask me details about my car so he can see if they have my tires. As he does this I mention to him that my appointment was confirmed so shouldn't all of this be in their system. He agrees then prints out a price higher than I was quoted online because he'd added all of the ""hidden services"" on and charged me for more expensive tires. I tell him thats not the price that I was given online and that I did not want those services. He proceeds to tell me THEN that he couldn't find an appointment for me. So I pulled up my confirmation email on my phone. So he then asked another associate for help in finding my appointment. He finally finds it and here comes the haggling about my tpms sensors. I tell him I do not want them replaced at this time and that they need to be mindful when replacing the tires not to break them. He continues on and on about how it can throw my tire light off and now i'm annoyed and cut him off to remind him of what I just said. So he finally stops.As i'm waiting for my tires I see him walking my way with something in his hand. What do ya know, its a broken tpms sensor! He proceeds to tell me how this was broke when they found it and again that I need to get them all replaced. You can imagine how mad I am now. I'd just got my 2 front tires replaced at the Salisbury NC location with NO issues. By this point I tell him to just leave me alone and finish with my tires so I can go.The next morning I get in my car on my way to work and I hear a VERY loud noise coming from my tires. Luckily I live right around the corner from a location so I go immediately there. The associate hops in my car and drives around and comes back. He then pulls my car into the garage, fix it, and bring my car back to me. Something about the way the tires were installed. Now I also have a constant tire pressure light on thanks to Charlotte.  Trust me, stay away from the South Blvd Charlotte location.",0
"I heard Franklin Graham's response on Fox to the Supreme Court annoncement, and it frankly disgusted me. Completely. Our country was founded on the principal of separation of church and state, and Franklin's (and for that matter MANY Christian's) personal religious views have NO right whatever to trump the constitutional rights granted by the US constitution for equal treatment under the law, without regard to race, age, religion, or creed. Separation of church and state has been operative in this country now for over 200 years, in case you haven't been following it, thank you very much.I used to be Presbyterian, went to Montreat many many times, and graduated from Davidson College. I am NOT gay.But this is exactly the kind of narrow and truly misguided thinking and leadership exhibited by pontificating religious bureaucrats of all stripes that has gradually me driven away from organized religion, and which is driving most younger people away from it as well.Get over it. Let all-inclusive love reign the day as Jesus himself preached, instead of clinging stubbornly to ancient texts which were written in a much different time.The world has always changed through the millenia, and you can either grow with it, or become a dinosaur. From Mr Graham's remarks, I assume he's very much solidly in the dinosaur camp. And we know what happened to the dinosaurs........Fie on you and all the closed minded goodie goodie holier than thou church folks who in many ways do not practice, in effect, the TRUE teachings of Jesus.Maybe you should go to Montreat and have a serious rethink about some of the teaching your promulgate......",0
"I didn't have the opportunity to try the food, but I did have a taste of the rude bald guy's ways as we were trying to get a copy of one of the small menus. Being rude and snarky to customers and telling them that there is an 8' menu is not the way to keep or attract customers .",0

"I was migrated over to PAP from Barnett Real Estate. The level of service at BRE was great and I was assures that Id remain satisfied once absorbed into PAP. The quality of service has been inconsistent at best.  Perhaps I'm lucky to havr had good tenants.  Most recently, my property was not advertised for rent until 15 days prior to it being vacant. The move out inspection was completed long after the tenants moved out. As of the move out inspection datr, there were no utilities on at the property. Electrical could not be inspected. The HVAC system is in need of replacement. Money has been sent to cover that. It can't be properly replaced/tested without electrical services. So I'm losing money, patience and cool.  Emails and phone calls to the owner relationship manager have gone ignored several times.  The most recent tenants also expressed dissatisfaction particularly when needing to report maintenance issues over the weekends.  If you haven't signed to allow them to manage your property, don't.  If you have, join me me in exploring options.",0
"I went to this Starbucks before work because it's the closest one, i had a drink remake coupon from the day before as another starbucks had messed up my drink and i didn't have time for them to remake it as i was in a hurry.

She told me "" she wasn't going to look into it because it wasn't right i was given that"".... i saw no problem in why i was given that since it was a free drink since they messed mine up.

They got my order wrong twice. I went there on Monday 7/13 and ordered 2 small and 1 medium Chicago mix. He bagged it up and left it on the counter and let me wait a few minutes as I paid. When his coworker tried to give me the bag he said the order was wrong and there was 3 smalls in there. He said he was packing a medium and the exchanged what I thought was a medium bag. But when I got home from driving back to California I looked at all three bags and they looked and felt the same. So I didn't get my medium sized popcorn even though the worker said he re packed one for me. This place had one of the worst customer service I had in Vegas. It's not a lot of money but to watch this guy pack the wrong sized bag twice makes me want to tell everyone to avoid coming to this location.,0

"Think twice about this place. I made an appointment with this office a year ago. My first visit was simple and the doctor and I chatted. They told me that they are very helpful to their patients and would charge me very little to help out. They quoted $100 per session won't or without insurance. So my second visit comes around. They scheduled me incorrectly for the day previous. So I reschedule for the following week. That day comes and they double booked my time slot and I ended up seeing the doctor for only half my session an hour late. After having that bad experience I told them I wouldn't be coming back. They said they'd bill me and I never received anything. I find out recently, they put a claim in for $760 stating that my insurance didn't cover anything.  I feel taken advantage of and for my first counseling visit, something that is already uncomfortable and foreign it didn't help with my problems. I haven't seen someone since because I'm worried this will happen again. Beware.",0
If I could give less I would. I basically didn't get any service because no one for 10 mins even can over to my table. It wasn't busy and 5 waiters looked me directly in my eye but nothing.

"I have been going to this place for the past three to four years. I can't take it anymore. I have been going here because they take my insurance and it's conveniently located. They do not care about the patients. I feel that all they really care about is the money. I have met one or two nurses that were very nice but other than that, all of them were careless. What stirred me up is that I have gotten a filling last year and they had told me the pain would go away in a few weeks. So I waited. Months went by and I could not eat or drink on my right side. I went back earlier 2013 and explained to them that the pain has not gone away. Two girls were talking among themselves saying that it must have been this one nurse that messed it up. They did something to my tooth which I'm not sure of but it eased the pain just a little bit. They told me to give it a few more weeks. Again, it's been months. I woke up in screaming pain. Went back to see a dentist again and told me that it's the same tooth and that there had been a crack in the filling. There's an infection and it's affect all the nerves on the right side of my mouth. I'm in dire pain. I need a root canal now and it will be done in a couple days. My mother was so upset that she decided to call them and ask them if they are going to completely take care of everything since it was there fault. They had said that I haven't been there since 2011.... WHAT? I'm done. I never want to go back there again. Finding a new dentist immediately.",0

Absolute thieves. They made up charges that I am not responsible for on my move out. They stole my deposit. THEIVES!!,0
Don't go to this Discount Tire the assistant manager is a joke.  I will never go to this location again and I just live right around the corner from this store.  I will go to the Rainbow and Charleston store very nice people there.,0
"Disrespectful and poor customer service. Price is ridiculously high. Terrible experience overall. Avoid !We had a reservation for a large group. Our time was awkwardly cut short 20 minutes by staff to accommodate another incoming group. Our group leader who paid was not given back their reservation deposit. Also staff did not give adequate receipt of purchase (item receipt) when requested, instead scribbled some numbers on a scrap piece of paper.",0
Ugh BMW Service Department is by far the worse when it comes to customer service!!!   They say one thing and do another. They don't have anyone answering their phones early enough to pick up your car like ALL other dealerships do. You walk in and the ladies are talking with each other having a good time but I get a voicemail over and over on my drive over.  If you're open ANSWER THE PHONES!  Another time I wasn't called when my car was ready because my service advisor was off.  I didn't have a loaner. I ended up just showing up the next morning to pick up my car because once again no one was answering the phones. I was told I didn't have an appointment and I had to WAIT when I confirmed I did!   This is the 2nd time I set up an appointment and when I get here I'm told I don't have one.  Just about every time I come here there's a issue.  They have no consideration for people's time.,0
Worst service. None of the waitresses or waiters care. Ended up leaving because no one cared to serve us anything. Worst restaurant staff attitude and everything.,0
"Went here to get sale price on Xmas gifts for clients. Not a regular shopper here but after today, am very glad. In the midst of Holiday season and there are 2 lanes open for 40+ shoppers. The store could not locate my online order and refused to match the online price, even with an order #. Bunch of dimwits and sorely understaffed. I'm surprised KMart/Sears has not closed up shop yet.",0
I give this location 0 stars!  I ordered the Tropical Chicken Sandwich and all I got was the jerk mayo with lettuce.  It was my first time in and I won't be returning.  I feel the Franchise owner should check his employees work ethic a little closer.  I was also rung up as a drive thru customer when in fact I went into the store.  $8.65 for a spicey mayo sandwich  :(,0
"THE worst costumer service you will very experience. I have been offended by their employees serval times but today was the last time. I proceeded to check out and the cashier told me in a very rude voice ""take the hangers off your clothes"" ok, I'm sorry that I forgot and apparently it's too hard for you to do your job and take the hangers off the clothes that I'm purchasing for your store! Then my little 4 year old found a toy phone he wanted with half the tag missing. She took it from his hands and said I can't sell this to you because YOU tore the tag off. Umm, excuse me I did not! I'm sure I could afford the 99cents that you probably were going to sell the toy phone for. I told her that she was being ridiculous and if she could just find a tag for the toy phone I promised to my son. She could careless and put the phone under the register-all while this is happening my son is crying for his toy phone! I could not believe she was making such an issue about a little toy phone. Then she said if I wasn't happy that I didn't have to shop there. Done! Plus I have been shopping there for 10 plus year and I will be taking ALL my donations that I have made over the years somewhere else. If you truly value your store and your customers, teach your employees some manners and respect! I will never return to this store again.",0
Had a karaoke bday party for my daughter there . When u walk in the smell of sewage was very offensive to the point where I almost took my 25+ party to a different restaurant. We were able to shut the door in the karaoke room and I had some body spray to help out too . The server was very polite but when it came time to pay the checks $43 came up missing so we basically paid for one ticket twice . Also forced me to pay for 3 premium rolls that were not ordered . The manager at the time seemed pissed off that I needed help w the karaoke machine that was entirely in Korean. even the machines are in Korean so very hard to work . The Mics they have are wireless and were dead 30 min into our party and I had rented the room for 2 hours . The sushi was yuck . Maybe because our order was very large but it tasted old . Most of us that ordered Sushi did not even eat it .,0
"I found this salon on google and decided to try it out, because it was one of the only ones I could find open on a Sunday.  I went in for an eyebrow wax and I would never go back or recommend it to anyone else.  The woman that did my eyebrows did an ok job, it seemed like she missed a lot of my hairs.  The skin around my eyebrows began to break out immediately after.  I am going to assume that the esthetician double dips into the wax and I caught something from that.  Otherwise she may have just used something that caused me to break out.  When I went to pay I asked the guy at the front about the bumps now on my face and he told me 'the bumps were probably there before I came in and I couldn't see them before.' ...because a rash on your face is totally something you wouldn't notice right?  I would never go back and recommend no one gets any part of their body that they care about waxed here.  Honestly I think giving this place one star is way too generous and I should have the option for zero stars.",0
"Complete idiots work here period! They call saying my contacts are in... when I go down there to pick them up, they tell me I need to make a follow up appointment before I can get them!  I asked them, why didn't you tell me that when you called? Why would you call to tell me my contacts are in? Like I said ""dumb and dumber"" work here... fkn clueless customer service... you can keep my checkup $$ never going back there, private optometrist with professional staff is what I need, Not Costco Crap-tometrist!!! Good riddance! You guys suck!!!",0
"The same person has called my business three times in two weeks asking to set up an appointment to sell me their printing services. The first time I told Linda I did not need their services.  The second time I told Linda that I STILL did not need their services and to stop calling. She gave a lame excuse that she's making hundreds of calls from the phone book and can't possibly keep track of who she's called. She said she couldn't guarantee that she wouldn't call back again.  Only excuses, no accountability. She wasn't even going to try to remember to not call me again.  And then she called the third time.  Same lame excuses.  If this is how badly they treat someone they're trying to interest in becoming a customer, I will never take a chance on doing business with them.  I don't know if they're any good at printing, but they certainly are no good at treating people well.",0
Horrible service plus very expensive food. Restaurant was empty and it took a half an hour for a waiter to come and take our order for drinks. Would not recommend.,0
"STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE ACCURATE & SAY IT ALL. I'm a local resident of Las Vegas and if you stay here don't expect professionalism, or a good nights rest. Fertitta Family & Station Casino's YOU CAN DO BETTER, FIX THIS PROPERTY, FIRE THE ROOM MANAGEMENT rest this is my review: Nothing against the restaurants and to be fair I will rate them separately, but dear god the service at the hotel belongs out of state not in Las Vegas Nevada, what a disappointment.I really, really regret having booked this location given all the hotel properties in Las Vegas. I called to complain and tried to get resolution. The manager Lana that I spoke to said she would investigate the issues we had and call me back, she never did despite 2 follow up phone calls. Let me explain how the staff at palace station cost my local business in Las Vegas $700.00. I booked the room for a contractor near a construction site where we were working. My contractor was coming in late, so I went early to check him into the hotel and ensure he got the room we reserved. When he arrived at 3 AM they accidentally put him into an occupied room, fortunately the occupants were not there and my contractor is an honest man and did not take any belongings from that room. He went back to the lobby explained what happened they checked his ID again and placed him in another room. He was exhausted and only after 30 minutes of being in the ""new room"" he was woken up by a phone call by the front desk and asked to confirm his name, he thought  it was odd but then tried to go back to sleep. About 15 minutes later another phone call came in stating he needed to VACATE THE ROOM ASAP. He refused, explained it was late needed to sleep and the hotel front desk said we would be charged the room fee for staying there. They asked again to confirm his name over and over. He explained he wasn't moving to a 3rd room in less than 2 hours of arrival. Our contractor also explained that he was tired and had to be at work in a couple of hours and needed to sleep to function since he had to operate heavy machinery. The hotel kept asking how soon he could come back down to the lobby, he said by 7. By this our contractor was really upset and only slept 45 minutes, when he went back down no one knew what he was talking about the person that had called harassing him from the front desk was on break. He waited 30 minutes and called to tell us he would not be able to make it to work on time because he had not slept. At about 745 AM he was put into the ""correct room"" that we had originally checked him into. He finally got to sleep and showed up to work at noon. Since our work was time sensitive another company started the work and invoiced us $700.00, so we had to pay them on top of our contractor. Had he been allowed to sleep he would have arrived at work on time and we would not have had to resort to getting additional help. The thing that upsets me the most is that there is no apology or acceptance of some accountability from the hotel. When I called I was calm provided just the facts I was promised a call back instead we have been ignored and brushed off, so my plan is to invoice the hotel for our loss.",0
Advertised happy hour apps are a scam! Must sit at bar. So we order a pizza  & a large salad to share plus the app wings to be told can't serve us. Not coming back!,0
"CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!! I have a severe dairy allergy and every time i've ordered food here (both in person and through the app) i've gotten home and discovered my food COVERED in cheese, sour cream, and sauce, even though i've ordered it ""fresco"" style and emphasized that my food not have dairy products. there was even shreds of cheese in the guacamole i got with chips. yes, i understand there can be issues when ordering without certain ingredients (especially at a fast food chain), but taco bell prides itself and boasts about how ""friendly"" they are with this (and even have a term in the system for it) and can't seem to not ruin my food every time. people i've gone with who order straight off the menu have been underwhelmed by this location. food is many times cold and flavorless. and my vegetarian friend received a burrito inside a tortilla that was covered in dried meat, so she couldn't eat either.the people who work here have seemed very nice, but they need to pay closer attention to customers orders.",0
"The older man is rude and dismissive. I've been here since 12, it's 12:23 now and I still haven't gotten my order.  No excuses. I will NEVER return and neither will my roommates.

My last visit at Home Depot. I'm so confused as to why they didn't put me the customer first. This is my second visit to resolve an issue. Instead of providing a solution for me they were rude and unaccommodating. I had to find my own solution. I will be shopping Lowes where me as a customer will be treated fairly and valued.,0
I had an absolutely terrible experience when I came here about two days ago because for one when ever I'd mention something to the vet he would blatantly ignore everything I said to him because he thought that because someone who was obviously superior to me was the one he should be talking to but she had really no idea what was wrong with my dog she was really only there for moral support.,0
So I am here 5 minutes to 9 pm and the bakery is close not only closed but cleaned and all the bake good are emptied which means it has has been closed way before 9 pm,0
"Do not take your vehicle here for anything.  I spent $2k getting an oil leak fix and have been back 3 additional times because my car is still leaking but they tell me when they have it it doesn't.  I'm confident they broke something and don't want to own up and fix it.  I've since taken my car to another shop where they want another $1500 to repair what ever this shop did.  These guys won't own up, refund me or fix the leak.  Waste of money, time and I'm never going back here and I recommend you don't either. Take a look at these photos...it's not like there is a pinhole leak somewhere.  My car was leaking much less before I took it here and I'm just shocked that I took it back 3 additional times giving them the opportunity it's to fix and all 3, yes 3 times they told me my car is dry as a bone and not leaking!",0
I wish this place was as good as most Jack in the Box restaurants. It's not. Neither the food nor the service. I've had so many problems here I wouldn't know where to begin describing them.Do yourself a favor. There are dozens of other places around this place. Go somewhere else.,0
"I had an implant placed by Dr. Goaslind in this office.  Long story short- I had to pay another dentist $1000 to fix Dr. Goaslinds' mistake placing the wrong abutment.  He agreed to refund me $138 for his cost of the abutment but that isn't any where near what it cost me to fix it. I could never even get Dr. Goaslind to call me back and speak to me personally about the situation- apparently he is too busy and prefers to communicate strictly through his office people who know nothing about the situation. I also had problems with my temporary crown that kept falling off and when I called to explain my emergency situation (It was my front tooth- totally mortifying!) they were completely unsympathetic and unwilling to help because it was toward the end of their day. I ended up going somewhere else for this too, and upon a friends' recommendation found a dentist who actually cared and was able to remedy the situation right away. I was truly disgusted with the lack integrity Dr. Goaslind extended. Why would I ever recommend this place to anyone after such an awful overall experience here?",0
citywide security needs to be taken to court because they steal money from their customers by not performing any security services after being paid! over 30 vehicles with broken windshields this month in apartments because they never patrol! report these criminals and phonecall toughguys to the bbb and the police now!,0
"Terrible experience, one of the worst Mexican places in Madison. Food is plain and lacks flavor. They charge you for hot sauce if you want to get one for your tacos. They are pretty cheap, chilaquiles won't ce with beans. They give you like two tablespoons of salsa for 6 people and of you ask for more they charge you extra. They give you less than two half of bowls of chips for 6 people and then charge you if you ask for more. When we express our concern about the extra charges the waiter did not care. Her answer was: it's been like this for many years. Don't go the. Go to el pastor, los gemelos, taqueria Guadalajara.",0
WORST SERVICE EVER!!! We had the same server as last time we came it had been a few months we figured we would try it Again Thursday at 345 late lunch not a very busy time worst I have ever gotten!! I work in a restaurant and I am so tolerant to mediocre service but this was just BAD having worked in the service industry for 12 years this was awful took 5+ minutes just to get greeted me and my two guests all ordered beers my beer was kicked ok no problem took a while longer my girlfriends beer wasn't even the right one.. I order a different beer because after 10+ minutes she tells me the keg is no good (basically they don't have another one) meanwhile my friend had already ordered his second beer still hadn't gotten it long story short we were there for 30+ minutes my friend had 1 beer my girlfriend 0 and me half of a hefe from a kicked keg.. Definitely won't be back wanted to take my friend from out of town for a late lunch they seemed like we could get a good happy hour there but never again,0
"I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. We arrived at the Rampart location tonight around 7:45 PM. They were not that busy and we were seated right away. We sat down and started discussing what we wanted to eat for about 15 mins. Thinking someone would come to our table and take our drink orders. After about 5 mins I comment how long it is taking for someone to come. We all agree and I look around and see waiters standing in the back near the kitchen talking. I wait a couple more mins then pull out my phone to time how long it takes for someone to come and acknowledge our table. After 10 mins we decided to get up and go to another establishment. As we were walking out I went to go and tell the hostess we were leaving and she was no where to be found. I look to the back kitchen, and she is standing over with the waiters talking. I can't believe we wasted a good 30 mins at this place. To never even be acknowledged. Never come here - from the other reviews. It's a hit or miss if the food is good or not. Better not risk it...",0

"Don't rent a car from Enterprise LVH (westgate) hotel. They just tried to blame me for damage that already existed on the car. I knew something was strange when the rental representative who rented me the car told me I was being too meticulous with the prior damage report. I almost listened to her but instead, I took video. When I returned the car, the rep went over the car and found some kind of cut under the bottom of the bumper.Luckily, I was able to just record the damaged part before I took the car. Still not worth the trouble renting from this location.",0
Went through the drive through and waited over 20 minutes for my food. There was also a car in front of me who was waiting when I arrived so God knows how long they were waiting. Awful service.,0
"Been waiting home all day for a package that I had to sign for. I go to take the trash out and see the ""sorry we missed You"" sign from FedEx..on my neighbors door.

"Sabor has great food, but this location has very slow service.  Waited over an hour, well worth drive to South Tyron alternate location for those in South Charlotte.",0
"This place doesn't deserve that one sad star.  It is, without a doubt, the most disgustingly neglected and poorly run hotel I have ever seen.The visit started off on the wrong foot with the front desk employee telling us our reservation came in as smoking instead of non smoking, but that ""not to worry"" because they ""aired our rooms out."" Clearly another guest had refused to stay in these rooms and he was trying to push them on us. Not the best customer service. Once we got to the room, I fully understood what we had gotten ourselves into: the smell hit me abruptly. It reeked like someone's chain smoking grandmother's house and the door was wide open. While my husband checked to see that no unsavory characters lurked in the bedroom, I observed a filthy carpet, a dilapidated couch with numerous suspicious stains and an A/C unit with cigarette burns and ash all over it. The coverlet on the bed had what looked like blood stains and I have seen cleaner gas station bathrooms than the one in this ""suite"".We found another hotel, booked it, then asked for our money back from this dump. The front desk employee told us he would take care of it. When we called the website we booked with, they told us no one had contacted them. We followed up with the employee and he told us we had to call them ourselves, so we called back. The website said the hotel was responsible for issuing a refund. Finally a manager got involved and handled it, but it seems as though Quality Suites will do whatever they can to keep your money, including lying to your face. Reading reviews across the internet, we definitely aren't the only people who have had this experience. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this $h!thole.",0
"If you're planning on getting their strawberry horchata don't... I honestly was expecting it to taste like horchata. Tastes nothing like it what so ever, to my sister and I it tastes like watered down rotten milk with strawberries. So not worth the money... also not worth the hype.",0

"My plans for a birthday celebration were absolutely ruined! I chose this restaurant as a first experience for myself and my partner. I made a reservation for 8p on 11/30/2019, paid for a Lyft to arrive on time for this specified reservation only to be contacted at 7:47pm to say that they are unable to seat due to a generator issue. Of course I was beyond livid, and was suggested to try my dining experience at the buffet instead. I thought to myself maybe this was a small mishap that might be resolved in a short time, so we waited about a half hour. After cocktails at the McCalls Whiskey bar, we decided to go to the buffet as suggested so that this trip would not be a wasted inconvenience to the strip and lose out on travel expenses. We spent over $50 for the most mediocre food ever which later made me ill after trying the ""Steak & Shrimp"" advertised.  However, after speaking with Andrew (manager), the following day I was informed that this issue occurred as early as 3pm that day, and although not anticipated and hoping for the best, calling a patron 13 minutes before their reservation is absolutely unacceptable & quite inconsiderate, and loathsome. However, had we been informed about this issue that was well into hours of have been going on; other plans could have been made. Also, I would have understood and still planned to have dined there at a later date. I'm sorry I forgot to mention that I had already purchased a Groupon to have this ""great"" dining experience. So this entire evening costed me more money and more grievance than an enjoyable night out for someone's birthday. Speaking w/Andrew was even more infuriating, because I basically got ""Sorry, not Sorry"" and a half a** apology. I myself have worked in customer service and relations for over 20 years, and if I delivered a ""Sorry not sorry""; I would not only disappoint the customer and leave the nastiest taste in their mouth, I would be disappointed in myself! Murphy's Law shows that yes things happen sometimes that are beyond our control. However, how you handle those certain occurrences is what shows due diligence and consideration for someone else's time can also go a long way in building rapport and trust. This was not one of those moments! A simple heads up an hour before my reservation would have saved me time and money as well a more desirable dining experience! This does not make me want to step foot back in this entire establishment in the future at all. This is far from a rant, this is an expression of and for those who are told ""Sorry not Sorry"" instead of given a sincere apology for an absolute mistreatment of a patron's time and money! Most people just walk away with that nasty taste in their mouth and never speak on it. I am NOT one of those people! Thank you!",0
"After 2.5 years of sending my son to this swim school, I'm left super unhappy with our experience. I find the pay structure to be unreasonable, if it's a Monday holiday or something happens in the pool they cancel lessons and then only give you a make up class to reschedule. But don't add additional classes to accommodate makes ups, you just have to hurry up and schedule what's available. Not to mention the possibility of being a single parent and trying to navigate an already difficult schedule. Also In December they close for 2 weeks.. so all these closures, and they still charge you the same price every month. If the company has scheduled breaks, I find it ridiculous to still charge people for time the pool won't even be open! By the time I said enough was enough we had nearly 15 make up days. These weren't days we missed or canceled, but days that THEY canceled or changed. After voicing my concern, I was told by a manager that they would hold off on charging my account.. and I could use up the make up classes.. and wouldn't you know it not one week later I was charged for another month! I guess my business wasn't very valuable to this company, even after 2 and a half years! I went in to withdraw my son from the school and asked if there was a phone number or email to contact the owners, and was told no. That I could contact the general manager. So this the reason for going to yelp. I tried to speak my concerns to the owners, and I was denied the opportunity. Additionally They change and switch instructors often, which was bothersome to me because each time that happened a child would have to get comfortable with a new swim coach and that coach would need to get to know the child and their abilities. It's almost a waste of a class, my child can't possibly make any progress between the coach changes and all the scheduled and in scheduled canceled classes. I would not recommend this school. I will say that I'm not just any disgruntled costumer, I've voiced my concerns many times, And nothings changing. I feel I provided ample feedback, and communication and gave it more and more time to improve many times.",0
By far the absolute worst restaurant in Montreal. Food tasted terrible and the service was cold and impersonal. Two of the four people in our group ended up vomiting when they got home. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.,0
"Wow, Sorry to have to come down on this establishment but it was a total mistake on how my party was treated there on Sat Night. We arrived at 6 PM Party of 6 adults and three Babies...We were told that it would be a 20 to 30 minute wait but they assured us that they could get us all at ONE table. We were all standing at the front of the restaurant I myself had just had a Total Hip Replacement 3 weeks before. The 20 minutes turned into 1 HOUR and 20 MINUTES. We checked with the hostess over and over. She then informed us that we would be sitting at TWO SEPARATE tables!! Which Obviously we could have done 1 HOUR and TWENTY MINUTES previous!! As we sat down, breaking up our party there was a four top that they sat two People at, right next to one of our tables. We asked the hostess if she could move the people to the other table so at least we could be closer since we had waited so long. She said she was not allowed to do that since the other table was a five top!. Now I have worked in a restaurant and I understand Seating, but this was a special situation, it was a celebration and we had been very patient for ONE HOUR and 20 MINUTES. My daughter asked if she could speak to the manager. He ( a young man in a baseball hat) approached us, did not introduce himself and asked what was the matter. We explained at least three times to him the facts about our long wait and that the two top that was sat right next to us was willing to move to the bigger table, so that WE WHO HAD WAITED SO LONG could be accommodated. He did not understand. He kept saying, no he would lose money that way. I said You will be getting the same amount if we stayed at the same tables or switched?? He did not listen and he made no restitution such as buying us a appetizer or dessert or even an APOLOGY! Just Stupid Management who did not teach the hostesses about seating nor the Manager about the CUSTOMER SERVICE. We stayed and ate..No celebration.We will not be returning now. and I warn you, if you have a big party and you want to sit together, GO TO A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT!",0

"Will do anything to get you in the door! Came in on Friday looking for a van Scott Smith (manager)  wrote down my price range and knew my goals. He said he would call me if they could find something at a different dealership they work closely with. Friday night they reach out and said they found a van for 10k and asked if I could come in the next morning. I found some vans too and ended up finding the same van Peoria Nissan did. Guy at this dealership said they were going to buy it for more then 10k so I was never going to get that price. He told Peoria Nissan it was sold and shortly after I got a call saying it was sold. I should of just cut my ties at this point but Scott pulled at my military ties gave me a Semper Fi and I gave him some trust. Monday I get a text that they had a van come in. I asked about price and was told it was getting checked out and he would get me the info ( never happend) I went in any way (my mistake) Scott passes me off to a sales rep ( nice guy no issue with him) and we walk to the van. I turn it on and 39k miles. I tell the guy ""he's just waiting my time, no way is this in my price range"" we go back and it's nearly 20k (that's double Scott) . I was upset said some words trying to be respectful of the sales guy who had no fault, but I did a poor job (sorry man) and exited the building. If a manager can act in this manner and pull an old bait and switch at what I thought was a reputable dealership I can only Imagine some of the shady things that are taught to employees. With so many dealerships to choose from in the Phoenix area you have no reason to work with a place that could act like they support the military and then completely waste a veterans time and cause  some very unnecessary stress and anxiety.",0
"First time customer, ordered off of Grub Hub had it delivered. Did not get order correct I ordered Gyros Plate said it came with fries when I opened food there were no fries. Girl that answered phone said it did not come with fries, I had to read it off the online menu. Said oh it must be an old menu from the old owner.

I'm actually giving DLUX zero stars.   I have been to the restaurant a couple different times & each time the service was absolutely Terrible!

This isnt just for this location but all. The cleaning people want to stay cleaning the locker rooms at 730am why can't this be done at 5am or before closing when they're really isnt that many people.  This morning the one lady was part washing the females locker room floors so everyone was standing there waiting to get in get thwir stuff or grab the stuff out of the lockers. I find this to be unreal more planning needs to go into things like this and this is not the first time.,0

"This urgent care is a disgrace. 1. I had a horrible flu a couple of months ago and I thought it was getting worse. My husband took me to the urgent care and not the hospital because we didn't feel the ER was appropriate. As soon as we got there, without even physically checking me, they said they couldn't treat me there because they didn't have an IV to treat me. So my husband drove me an additional 13 minutes to the hospital. ***I didn't think anything of it because I was sick and I just wanted treatment. So I didn't file a complaint.***2. My daughter has a stomach bug that caused her to have a high fever, vomiting, & diarrhea. We had already taken her to the doctors office that morning, but she seemed to get worse later that day. We wanted to take her to the urgent care because they would be able to tell us if this is a part of the stomach bug or if she was getting worse. Yet again, when we arrived, before even checking her, they said they didn't have an IV bag and so they wouldn't treat her. There's a couple things wrong with that.1. They didn't even bother to check my child to see if that's even what she actually needed. 2. They lied and said they didn't have equipment for an IV, but when I did further research, found out that was a bold face lie. We AGAIN drove 13 minutes to the hospital. When we got to the hospital, all they did was give her a prescription for nausea and diarrhea, give her a dose of Tylenol, & then an IV. Then they sent her home. ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE URGENT CARE. We ended up spending 3 hours in the ER, when it would have probably been no more than an hour at urgent care.If you need to go to the urgent care, DO NOT GO HERE. They will probably send you away too.",0
"Just went through the drive through and ordered a combo with cheese fries w/ jalapeños... well when I got my order, the fries were soaked with overflowing cheese sauce leaking out the box and dripping everywhere. The jalapeños were not on the cheese fries but on the patty melt itself. NEVER coming back to this location. I can see why it's so dead all the time.",0
"Please don't support this place! Worst service ever!! The Owner answers the phone saying... 'what did you want?' Incredibly rude tone and didn't even try to help me. I simply wanted to let them know the website shows fries beside the sandwich, not in the combo or mentioning a combo, nothing saying sandwich only. Instead of trying to listen he said it common since it doesn't come with fries. He refused to remove the tip!! Refused to refund the tip even and basically calls me stupid! Wow the owner!!! Now to the food. Gross!! Some meat is cold some hot, some is chewy some is soft. I asked for easy sauce and got way too much. The cheese is just splattered on top, the back half had most of the cheese so you need to spread and rewrap them. The soup was mostly water!!!! No chunks, just very minimal shreds of chicken. Decent flavor but bad value. 2 star on food but the owner made it a 0 star experience. He was the rudest thief I've ever spoke with. Never again!",0
This place has been up and down with me for quite some time. This time I have had enough my girlfriend and I had hibachi. We both ordered salmon and filet steak (medium rare). But this is now the second time for me the steak I received has been raw. My girl and I didn't even finish the steak we took it to go threw it away paid the check and left. It seems to me the chefs at this restaurant don't know how to cook steak if this is now the second time I have had raw steak at this place. Extremely disappointed and upset at this situation.,0
Beware. They do not answer their phones. I was on hold for half an hour before giving up. I was referred through my home warranty company but will be requesting a different plumbing company now.,0
There is not enough server so I didnt get help as much as I need and it is very expensive and air conditioner is broken,0
"Don't waste your time with JMK. There are many other options for landscape maintenance in Henderson. Their communication was terrible. Getting a call back took and act of God. Their pricing is competitive but in the winter months, cut their service to once a month, yet continue to charge full price. All in all, just a poor experience with this company.",0
"Terrible service / food in a captive market. We just finished breakfast, had to wait 25min althought the restaurant was half empty. Half our food was cold or wrong, and for the price, this is ridiculous. Strongly do not recommend unless you have nothing else.",0
"Headed to Huffman's for dinner Saturday night. First sign that told me I had not made the best decision was the completely empty dining room. The waiter was very pleasant and attentive, but there was no saving the food. For a chicken restaurant, I was expecting exceptional chicken, what we got instead was overpriced and underwhelming plates. We ordered the half roasted chicken, chicken and waffles and jalapeño burger.  The chicken was dry, over cooked and covered in a bbq sauce that lacked and true depth of flavor. The mashed potatoes were cold any served in disposable foil tins. The burger was over cooked (requested medium) and the crinkle cut fries didn't get eaten. Chicken and waffles lacked ANY flavor, left most on plate for trash. The most puzzling was when I told the waiter about our experience, he simply said, ""I know"". He knows what? Simply put, stay away.",0
"I was really excited to purchase new furniture from Living Spaces. My salesperson was extremely nice. He wasn't clingy or pushy. He was very personable. He answered questions and showed me several pieces. I decided on the set I wanted and left the store. I slept on my decision, because it was a major purchase. I selected a power reclining sofa, love seat and recliner with head rests and built in USB ports. I paid cash and didn't use any financing on May 16, 2019. The love seat and recliner were delivered the next day. I was told the sofa was on order and should be in before May 31, 2019. As of the writing of this review, the sofa has not been delivered. I have called Living Spaces several times and I am only told it's not in yet. I am extremely unsatisfied. My friend went with me as she is looking to replace her daughter's entire bedroom with new furniture. Based on my experience, she is now looking elsewhere. I'm so extremely unsatisfied. Living Spaces also sent me a store survey and I stated in that review that I was unsatisfied and still didn't have my sofa. No one from Living Spaces called me or followed up with me. This is will be the last time I spend over $2300 with this company. It appears as they do not value customers after they have your money.Update # 1 - I spoke to Eric (ID 2231). He acted as though he didn't care. He offered to allow me to pick out new furniture but I would have to pay for anything over what I originally picked. Update # 2 - I spoke to a different manager Renee. HE WAS FABULOUS! He actually listened attentively. He offered a few different options and thought outside of the box for a resolution. He said he would call me back because he was waiting on another department to get shipping information. After he heard from the other department, HE ACTUALLY CALLED ME BACK! He set the expectation and he's supposed to call on Monday 06/19/2019 Update # 3 - Still no sofa; and no return call from Renee on Monday. I've called everyday this week and left messages. They are closed for the holiday today. A CSR said the new date for when the store would have my sofa is 06/22/2019.06/20/2019 Update #4 Renee still has not called me back. It's Thursday. I've been waiting since Monday. I emailed the socialmedia@livingspaces.com. I received the following reply: ""Hello, We sincerely apologize for the length of time it has taken to receive the rest of your order, we have reached out to our warehouse managers for clarification of the location of the item. We will follow up with you by end of business day today to schedule delivery. Kind Regards,"" I received a text message to schedule delivery. Delivery is scheduled for tomorrow between 12-6. I called back to Living Spaces to speak with Renee. He's on a call and has a meeting so he can't talk me.",0
"Slippery Pig Sucks!!I bought a 2007 Kona Dawg ($1,500.00) form the pig.  Everyone (Including Eric, the owner)  were friendly and helpful.  The bike came with a 1 year maintence package to set up the bike and fix problems with it free for a year (pretty standard).  Ive been riding bikes all my life and this brand new expensive bike never shifted right, the chain popped off the front sproket and the chain rubbed on the front derailuer.  I brought it in several times.  Most of the mechanics were cool and tried to solve the problem, but never could.  One mechanic tried replacing the cassette.  Eric, the owner, got pissed that this was cutting into the profit.  He repremanded the mechanic (who no longer works there) and told me I had to deal directly with him.  He said there was nothing wrong with the bike.  He said it was the way I rode it.  I replied that I may not know as much as he did about bikes, but Ive been riding my entire life and know what a bike should sound and feel like.  He dismissed me and said when he rode it, the bike was fine.At the time, I worked for a local Phoenix news station, you know, the one who does all the investigative reports.  I wore my station hat in the pig.  Eric became all sorts of friendly and helpful.  He called Kona, and found out there were issues with the geometry of the frame and the components Kona put on it.  He ordered a spacer kit for the bottom bracket from Kona, put it on and solved the problem.  now was that so hard, Eric?There are many places to buy a bike in Phoenix.  most of the times, the prices are comparable.  What you are really paying for is knowledge and service.  The service sucks at the pig.  Buy your bike else where, like Tempe Bikes.",0
"First time experience at this location, it closes at 3AM but really they close at 2AM, fix that. There's lot of things they don't make after 130AM even though it's still business hours. If you want to run a business run it well and have better customer service. If you don't like your job, don't work here. Don't get rude with customers, don't lie and say the waffle maker is broken when it isn't. The dessert I got wasn't as great, the vanilla ice cream was the only good thing . Do better.",0
"This was the worst Mexican food ever, they don't know any better! I suggest to take a trip anywhere to U.S. to learn what good Mexican food looks like. I don't recommend it at all!",0
"The guy who helped me was super nice, but charging me $1.50 plus the printing fees when I could've sent what I needed to print online for like .10 is ridiculous. Barely any box size choices and what they do have is expensive for what it is. Again, their customer service is fine, the policies and prices are terrible. I will be avoiding this place next time.",0
"All I see I'd fake 4 and 5 star reviews! What's the point of a drivethru if they make you pull out to the parking lot and wait...  To make matters worse a screw up my order and forget to give me some sides. when I go inside  They're all joking and playing like it's a game ""sorry sir we're in training"" is answer I got. Some management! 6 PM picking up food after a long days of work to go home You're expecting  Fast reliable drive thru service....not this garbageI'm writing this at a red light just around the corner from the place they better hope and my food taste good when I get home otherwise I will drive back and asked for my money back and make a stink about it",0
"I used this company to finance my photo booth purchase. I've had an auto withdrawal for the monthly payments for over a year for the same dollar amount. Suddenly this month, I'm hit with an additional $100+ charge with no warning. They stated it's a property tax. I'm completely disgusted at how they think it's ok to just suddenly deduct more without any prior notice.",0
Fly's on the donuts. Pointed out to staff and they just laughed. See attached picture of fly on donut.,0
"Literally the worst. I promise you it's not worth the discounted rates they quote. They are the opposite of Flow from Progressive. I was shocked when I stepped on the plane and they didn't start charging for oxygen. Plus, I think they have about 3 planes. There was one plane stuck in Texas so they couldn't get us home for three days and wouldn't pay for a room. Luckily they refunded the money and we drove a rental home.",0
"I should preface my experience by saying that the manager of the store did help in some way to try to make the situation better; however, I will NEVER give money to this particular store for their beauty services ever again. So how my story goes:I wanted a fresh face of makeup and my hair curled for my engagement photos. I am not very good at makeup and just wanted a fresh look for pictures and NOT a glam look since I wanted my engagement photos to look natural. I decided to do it at Ulta since it was relatively cheaper and I shop there a lot. When looking online I booked a hair curl apt (30 mins, $30) and an everyday makeup application (45 mins, $45)... so I was looking to spend about $75 dollars which I was okay with. When I got to my appointment the beautician that was supposed to do my makeup and hair (Elsa was her name)started off by asking what I wanted I wanted done. I explained to her that I wanted a fresh face of makeup and my hair curled for my engagement photos. Right away she pushed for me to get fake eyelashes (which I did not want since I wanted to look natural). She would not let up on the subject so I finally caved.. she said she would only charge me $10 for the individual ones (which was nice to not charge me the full amount but I really didn't want them). After this she asked how I wanted my hair and I explained I just wanted my hair waved. She immediately fought me on this as well and told me I should have my hair curled curled, like ringlets. After I said a couple times that's not what I wanted she finally agreed. After discussion of what I wanted she went through the pricing for how she was going to charge me. She told me that I was going to be charged $60 for the makeup (because it was now a formal makeup application... I shouldn't have everyday makeup because I'm getting pictures done) and my hair was going to be $75... aka I was going to be paying almost $200 for my appointment. I was APPALLED and did not understand how a simple hair curling was going to be $75 dollars. She claimed that my hair was too long (it is a little longer than my shoulders) and thick for just a 30 minute hair-do (and for the record my hair is extremely thin). I told her I can curl my hair in 15 mins TOPS. We went back and forth for awhile with her not giving any semblance of a real reason as to why she would charge me $75 besides that I have longer hair. (????) I was sitting in the chair panicking on how I was going to do my own hair since I did not bring anything and my pictures were in 2 hours. Finally a manger came over (Ashley) and asked what the issue was. I explained to her that the beautician wanted to charge me $75 to curl my hair. She pulled the beautician aside and when they came back she told me she (she meaning the manager) would curl my hair while the other did my makeup. The one doing my makeup was constantly running around trying to find more makeup and was not prepared to do my makeup really at all. An appointment that should have taken 45 mins (because they were doing my makeup and hair simultaneously) ended up taking almost 2 hours. And mind you-- I have had my makeup done by a professional beautician before WITH airbrushing, fake eyelashes the whole thing and it took her maybe 45 mins. At the end of all this, I ended up paying $110 AND the beautician who did my makeup claimed on the bill that she did both my hair and makeup (which I only found out when I said I wanted to tip them both and the cashier was confused as to why there was only one name). The beautician's (Elsa) whole persona was a huge turn off and not someone I would want to do my makeup again. She was trying to push her own agenda which was VERY upsetting. Aka constantly trying to charge me more money and do what she wanted to do rather than what I wanted. Don't get me wrong the makeup looked decent. But it was not what I wanted. I even asked her to cut down the eyelashes before I left. The entire time I was sitting in the chair I felt like I was being up-selled (I know not a word). The beautician that did my make up was just trying to make more money.... that's all I can say from this situation. I am still very upset about the whole thing... it was not what I expected. As an almost DIAMOND member of Ulta I expected WAY better service and most importantly to get what I wanted. For some $200 may have seemed legit but for that money I am going to a nice salon and getting the works done. Not sitting at Ulta where they pull the beauty products off the shelf. I don't really feel comfortable posting a picture so you will just have to take my word for it.",0
"Called the salon to advise the owner that my polish had come off of two of my nails WITHIN 24 hours and she never apologized, blamed it on the polish and hung up on me. DO NOT BUY THE GROUPON - it's not worth it. Spend the extra $10 dollars for a place without the techs' children running around, missing supplies and unprofessionalism.",0
One of the worst Wendy's I have ever been to. Arrived approximately 6:00pm today. Ordered meal ok. But the kitchen was totally disorganized! The left hand did not know what the right hand was doing. During their confusion one of the workers swiped my order receipt off the counter and walked off with. Now I am unable to go on the company website to write a review.After waiting 15 minutes for my order and pointing out where parts of my order were left off to the side and how disorganized they all were I was greeted with an attitude by someone in a black uniformed who acted like they were in charge. Demanded that I repeat my order because they had know idea what it was.,0
"This company is a pure piece of crap group of people. Let me explain the ways. I lived at 245 Melwood, Wellington 701 for a year.-the ceiling of my bathroom collapsed in winter because there was a water leak. They ripped up the remaining ceiling, left a fan running (which did nothing other than spread the mold to the rest of the place), then patched it up with the space still wet. So guess what.... if you're living in 701 be ready for more ceiling fallouts.-they claim they provide a bike room. Well, the bike room is in the basement, which smells like a sewer. The room is infested with roaches; every time you turn the light on they scurry away, except the dead ones. It is in the basement, with the only path a winding narrow staircase with heavy doors which don't really allow you to get your bike in. And if you use the elevator they whine at you you're not supposed to do that.-They demand that you move out on the 28th of your last month. So where are you supposed to go for the 2-3 more days before you next lease starts?-I scrubbed my apartment clean. They took photos and doctored them to make them look bad. Charged me for the sink stain (iron from their ancient pipes), oven stain (rusted oven), and bath tub (scratched tub which was stained by the ceiling work mentioned above). They charged me $230 for the cleaning which they state took 12 hours at $20/hour. Oh and by the way, when asked to show the product of the cleaning ""we don't have time to take photos of each apartment."" Oh so you have time to take doctored photos before, but not to show what you did. Very convenient.-These ancient idiots demand payment in paper check. Seems weird, I mean PayPal and Venmo are free to set up. And so is any other online billing system. Sure enough they charged me for a late fee one month because they said I dropped off the check late. There is no way to prove I didn't because they can just stamp any date they want on the check. Very convenient again.-minor stuff like the elevator breaking basically every month is a smaller deal. At least they don't charge the crap out of you just for their own garbage quality.-They also decide that the appropriate place for cat litter disposal is INSIDE the entry of the building. How dumb is that? So every time I walk in from the parking lot I get to smell the entire building's cat excrement. Super smart.There really is no surprise in my mind they prefer renting to international graduate students. These students typically leave after 1-2 years, so any charges levied on them they have a hard time fighting. They also do not know their options to pursue legal recourse. This is exactly what predatory leasing is all about.If you have a similar experience with this piece of garbage company please message me. I have lawyer friends and it would be great to be able to class action sue these jerks if the way they've overcharged me is a pattern.",0
Diaspointing experience. They advertise happy hour but beware that depending on where you are seated you may or may not be able to participate. When we were seated we were not told that there are no happy hour offers in our area and ended up going to the bar for a drink. Why would anyone pay $3 more sitting 10 feet away? Felt bad taking the service away from our waitress but they shouldn't advertise one price and then expect customers to be okay paying more. We did order dinner from our waitress and she was attentive and helpful. The food was mediocre at best and very over priced for what you get. The crispy chicken sandwich was very bland and dry. To make this dining experience even more painful the music would constantly skip. Don't know why they wouldn't just shut it off. Was very happy to get out of there at the end of our meal.,0
"Extremely bad customer service. I bought a mattress from there and they have mentioned that if anything goes wrong to the mattress, then they would directly exchange it back with a warranty and blah blah blah.It turns out to be crap and there are many hidden things. The customer service even mentioned that the sales people dont know these specifics and i asked why dont you educate them so that the customers would know about that. She said its not her job to do that. Was very rood and unprofessional and this would be my last time shopping there.",0
"You know when you crave a really good non-chain pizza pie, and there's only one certain taste that will cure your craving?  This isn't it.  Very disappointing.

Bad night at the pizza parlour?Updated to say we tried this place again on the weekend, and were very disappointed again. No more chances. We actually threw away an entire pizza and a pound of wings.

The worst sushi and sashimi and overall service I been to in AZ. Food is terrible. Trust me I am Asian and I know what good Asian cuisine is. Owner is very nice but that's it. Don't stop and keep driving. It's a waste of ur hard earned money.,0
"I went here with a groupon.  I was very dissapointed with the food.  We ordered sweet and sour chicken and curry chicken.  The food was served in a small soup crock.  The S and S chicken had a very very small amount of meat, it was mostly bones mixed into a broth which was actually not even safe since you had to hunt for the bone to not eat one by accident.  The dish was 13.00 and worth about 1.00 at best.  I would not eat here again even with a groupon.",0
This shop sold me a defective tire. I bought a tire from them yesterday and woke up today to a flat tire. I went to another tire shop and they found an unrepairable cut in the side wall. Very disappointed! Will not recommend! Bad business practices.,0
The waitress was hustling tips. My man was paying the bill he gave her 50 for a $47 bill and she asked if he needed change for something else or was he leaving a $3 tip for a $50 bill. He said no I have more change that I was leaving you she waited for it and grabbed his drink that was not empty and walked away. No thank you or sorry for the rude remark after the generous tip. He is normally very cool and calm but he was pissed about this. Not his first bad experience there either,0
"By far the biggest nightmare of my entire life!! I have been thru hell and back with this company since Sept.2018. My husband and I went in to purchase 2 oversized loveseats, by the time we left there,  we had been talked into purchasing a coffee table as well to get their ""special financing deal."" We told them we need it delivered anytime after 5pm due to us being at work. In the mean time,  EVERYDAY they scheduled us for delivery between 11am and 2pm. EVERYDAY we told them we were working and they rescheduled and like clockwork EVERYDAY they set us up for delivery between 11am and 2pm. Finally,  after almost 2.5 weeks. We got our first delivery at 10:30pm and the furniture was ripped. They tried to say that it wasn't that bad and give us a few bucks off, but no thank you! This went on with the next 5 love seats delivered. We finally kept one, (we gave up on two at this point) which I wish we never did, the loveseat lasted less than 2 months and something popped underneath it when I sat down one day. I called them and told them and now they say they cannot take back furniture that has been in my home for more than a few days. (The coffee table was a 200.00 piece of crap that I had to drive back to the store myself in my SUV to return) Now I am stuck with a piece of crap loveseat that hurts my back to sit on that I have tried to give back that I PROMISE I won't pay for. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY PLEASE DON'T SHOP HERE. AT THIS POINT I WOULD RATHER SIT ON A CACTUS!  P.S. I ONLY GAVE THIS PLACE 1 STAR BECAUSE IT DID NOT ALLOW ME TO GIVE IT -5 STARS WHICH IT WHAT IT DESERVES!!",0

"I feel compelled to add to the myriad horrible reviews of this terrible show.  The Treasure Island made a grave error in replacing the old pirate show with this travesty.  Sure the old show was family-oriented and they wanted to go more hip and risqué to go along with the TI name change, but this Sirens show is just downright silly.  At least the old show was fun.Incidentally, I've lived in Las Vegas for over 10 years.  I first saw the current show right after they converted it.  I thought it was horrible back then.  I finally decided to watch it again last night, only because we had time to kill between eating at the buffet and watching Mystère.",0
"While there can understandably be confusion and miscommunication during an estate sale, how it is handled is really important. Not only to the potential customer, but to the seller of the property to which they belong.That being said, the representative of Sunny was rude. And displayed very poor communication skills. I was personally treated with total disrespect. Perhaps because I was in weekend attire and was not dressed professionally. The person to which I am referring is named Jason. I had picked up and purchased a small table. I paid for the item and received my receipt. Then, a few minutes later, Jason came at me and said ""that item is sold."" To which I replied, ""yes sir. I just purchased it."" And I showed him my receipt. He said ""well it was already sold."" Ok, there is confusion. And I am understanding of that. However, Jason grabs one end of the table and we began a brief tug of war. Until he yanked it out of my hand. This could have been easily handled if Jason had explained the confusion, offered an apology, and allowed me to respond with mutual respect. Unfortunately, he was rude and abrasive. To add insult to injury, I heard him and another person whispering about me. And although I did not hear exactly the comments, one of them said ""no, he is still here, in the other room."" And of course they began to follow me and escalate my discomfort as a consumer. So, this may be an isolated incident. However, if it exemplary of the type of person or persons that run Sunny, they are very poor business people.I would not recommend them as a representative for your resale needs.",0
"Waited 30 minutes for two Italian Cheese Breads - Only one other customer in the building. Seemed like they were too busy goofing off and yelling at each other to make our food.

"Big rip off. I should have known better but i went there with a bubble in my tire that was dangerous. As soon as they put the tires on my tire light came on and my car was veering to the right. I took it back and they said i needed to get it aligned. I went to get it aligned and the alignment place said i needed to get to a tire place right away because my tire was splitting. I got to discount tire and they showed me the huge bubble that was formed on my tire. I should have just gone to discount tire in the first place. They are nice but horrible service. Put my life in danger. I went back and they said ""you should have just came back to us and gotten a new tire"" why would i go back to them? I wish yelp could  let me do zero stars.",0

"One of the worst places to go shopping! The employees which there are plenty of, have no idea about anything (even though you may notice lots of workers there is only ever 1-2 registers open at all times)! Every time I have been in here and asked an employee for help they never respond in a helpful manner they either start looking for the item I ask about, but have no clue as to where it is or they ask someone over their walkie which means they have no idea about general location at all of said item and that happens every time I have asked, the customers and employees are really ""ghetto"" at this location, idk how else to put it, the employees won't help and if they do try to help its with the worst attitudes ever! for the most part I see the employees walking around doing nothing trying to avoid contact with customers.. Also you don't have to take my word for it there is actually a video on Worldstarhiphop(.)com where a brawl breaks out between said customers and employees! Just type in Charlotte Wal Mart fight! You can probably find it on YouTube as well!",0
"The customer service at the fashion plumbing is unacceptable. We would like to buy a water softener on Thursday, on a slow hours at 4 pm. We've been waiting for 45 min and it was announced multiple times from the overhead but still no response. I tried to ask to talk to the manager but even the manager is nowhere to be found. Hope the management will do something to improve their customer service. Good thing Home Depot is just around the corner.",0
"I dropped off a book to be spiral-bound early Wednesday, with the promise that it would be done Thursday morning.  The gentleman I left it with seemed a bit distracted and not terribly interested in helping me, noting that he couldn't be sure about finishing at a certain time or being able to answer the phone if I called to check its status before coming by.Thursday morning, I arrived to pick it up, and another gentleman said, ""Oh, there's a problem with that book.""  The original guy had made a mistake and bound the wrong side of the book, requiring him to cut off a large portion of the borders.  He was ordering a new book to replace it, which would arrive Friday morning.  I was told the book would be ready Saturday morning.  Saturday, the book still wasn't ready.  Monday morning, my husband went to pick it up for me and it STILL isn't ready, with no explanation other than the man who does binding isn't here.  Frustrated now, I called to find out what was going on and was given no real explanation and no help about when it might be done.  Alan, who does the binding, should be in around noon or one, but that was it.  I finally requested that this be handled as soon as possible on his arrival and that someone call me when it was ready to avoid a fourth wasted trip.   No apology, no effort to contact us, no offer to call, etc.Look, mistakes happen and I'm perfectly sympathetic about that.  But I do expect a business to go to some lengths to fix it and make it right... without me having to try to work it out.  While two of the employees were very friendly, it seems the Postal Route really doesn't care about messing up the order or the inconvenience it has caused. The lack of customer service, sadly, is what has lost them any future business from me.Update:  I waited all afternoon for the call saying it was done.  No word.  Finally called at 5pm, and was told by David that the book never arrived.  I'm astounded that Alan never bothered to call me to let me know, and I still haven't gotten any kind of apology.  I'm very disappointed and will certainly not be going back there, and basically want the ruined book back so I can go somewhere else.",0
"Absolute worst customer service ever. We always stop by this place to buy sweets and have always been served by very nice employees. Today, my dad needed some water for his medication and waited in line and this employee by the name of Angie ignored him and served the other lady in the back of him stating that ""he was not in line"" ??? My aunt was also in line and asked for water and ignored her. My aunt said that she was being disrespectful and you know what the employee Angie's repose was? ""So"" and proceeded to laugh. She even had the audacity to call security on us even when she was in the wrong. I'm sorry but we won't be back for a while with this kind of service. To whoever the head manager of Baby Cakes is I advise you to fix your customer service!",0
"So let me just say I was sooo excited to try this place since I saw it on Instagram and so i went on Friday night for dinner 05/24/19 the food service was horrible they kept forgetting to bring our food dishes, we had our child with us and it took them 45 mins to bring our Fries and Fried rice which is ridiculous. We order nigiri which that took a whole hour to bring out of server said that they forgot to bring it out so they had to remake it, which when it came out it didn't even taste fresh we spent over 245 dollars and wasn't worth it at all. For it being our 1st time there it definitely makes me not want to go back. I understand having a big group but that should never happen. our server was super nice and great but damn that food service was just horrible!!",0
"I was in the store on Saturday and needed helping matching a shade of powder and I had looked through most of the items in the store and was never greeted, or even offered help. In fact I had made eye contact with one of the ladies working, a couple times, and instead of speaking to me, she walked around me to offer assistance to someone else. This is very upsetting because I was fully prepared to make several purchases, but was unable to get any help what so ever. Even when I waited patiently for the other lady to finish checking out her customer, when asked if she could help me match the powder she just said there are testers out and she could help in a few minutes, 15 minutes went by and she continued to ignore me and approach another lady, unprompted, to offer help. I will not be back to this location anytime soon. I will be driving to Charlotte to get my powder and foundation color matched and then purchasing online. I'm very disappointed to say the least.",0
"Horrible Horrible sales practice at this dealership - Rep by name of Trent Trader guaranteed that a car was still available - even went so far as to ""double check"" the stock # to guarantee its availability - I drove over 60 miles one way because I thought the car was a great deal - walked in and was greeted by Trent and he immediately told me the car was sold the prior Saturday ... this is totally unethical - he tried to show me other vehicles he had for sale - my time is very valuable to me - I don't need these kind of sales tactics - Unexeceptable!!!!   Warning friends, family, co-workers of this scam at this dealership!",0
They don't keep posted hours.  Arrived before 9pm rushed out and couldn't finish my beer.  According to Yelp  they still should be open.  Clown show.  Tuesday night bartender is a dick.  Typical success in one industry and think they can run a bar.  Clueless about service,0
"Every worker here is extremely rude, I have come in multiple times and never once has anyone here had a smile on their face. It's as if we the owners are in the back beating all of them before they send them out to make a sandwich. I come here quite often and I just hate that it takes so long to pick up an order and NO one, not one person, is enthusiastic about their job. You're luck if you get a half ass welcome to firehouse on top of it. Your attitude speaks volumes about how well you're going to prepare my food, let alone other people for Uber eats, you treat those drivers like their scum. I watched one of your employees give a driver straight attitude the moment he walked through the door. Fix your shitty demeanor.",0
"I have lived her for 2 years and when I first moved in, I really liked it. Since then, the apartment complex has come under new management and now I can't wait to move out. They are extremely rude. Seems like everyday I have a new angry letter on my door. I dread having to pick up packages from the front desk because I know I'm going to get attitude. The gates to the garage are always broken, which sucks since I pay $45 a month to park there. There is dog poop and pee in the hallways, and loud parties every weekend. My apartment is nice but not worth how expensive it is, how rude the people who work here are, and how loud/dirty it is.",0
"This FedEx location is a pig sty.  In the heart of Campustown they never shovel snow, trim weeds or pick up litter. They are always in violation of city codes requiring maintenance of their property and therefore, they are not good neighbors nor good citizens of our community.",0
We came here during St. Patrick's Day so  that was probably our mistake but 1.5 hour waiting at our table for two sandwiches and one was the corned beed special. Overpriced sandwich--I was close to asking giving me the meat and bread and I can make the sandwich myself.,0
"I went here for a massage a while back and the massage therapist was from Hungry. While giving me my massage- he said he had never seen a black person until he moved to the states. He continued on by telling me my skin was so soft. He then went into a story of when his neighbor called a lady a ""Nigger"". He actually used the work ""Nigger"". I was more than uncomfortable at that point. I do not recommend this place.",0
"Paid $185 today for an outing at this course. Range balls extra!! 105 degrees and were told that they couldn't afford to have a beverage cart on the course. Two of the very few water coolers were empty. Most of the ball washers didn't have water in them. None of them had towels attached. When I asked Josh inside for a towel for our cart he replied ""We only sell towels"". We waited on every hole during our five plus hour round. Never saw a marshal the entire round. Was told again that they couldn't afford one. Marshals in this town do so strictly for the free golf and are not paid. Come on now we all know that. Do not at all costs to your health, use the bathrooms on the course. No cart attendants to help loading the bags at the beginning of the round or to clean your clubs afterwards. Asked for a receipt and was told that they couldn't produce one. Poor conditions and obviously no one fills in divots or repairs ball marks on the greens. Trust me when I advise you to play elsewhere.",0
A few days after test driving the Jeep I saw i had multiple emails and calls from 3 sales people. I got all the info I requested. I decided to move forward with the purchase. I let them know I had to work the next 3 days. I emailed the main salesmen (Joe) and gave him the info he requested and let him know I had financing arranged. He asked if I would consider another finance company if he could get a better apr. I replied while on my break and said yes. I checked my email after work. I had one (from Credit Karma)telling that they ran a hard credit inquiry and saw 2 emails from Joe. One for a request to for a deposit and then one telling that he sold the Jeep to someone else.,0
"this restaurant is not even nearly as good as I expected it to be. I when to Montreal last week and my friend booked this restaurant, but we had to wait over half an hour before we can sit down. The food was not worth the waiting, their foie gras is simply to greasy. After two bites I got sick of it. I'll never come back for it again.",0
Do not I repeat DO not go here!!! This lady messed my eyebrows up so bad I'm crying. She took my entire arch away and left me with lines for eyebrows. I will never come back here. I can't believe I just paid 8 dollars for this mess. And when I told her she just walked away.,0
Soooo I got my nails done here Sunday. The guy who did my nails stopped doing my nail to take someone else nails off after waiting 30+ minutes to be seen. $40 for a full set wit gel polish Then after my nails was done I sat n waited 20 minutes for someone to do my pedi. The lady who did it asked to see my ID for the drink ok that's fine but my polish messed up. Then I asked her to fit it she told I need to be careful Needless to say I got home and my heels were still rough and my toe nails were all jagged,0
Nothing great about it. We waited for an hour thinking food will be worth the wait - it turned out to be opposite where the burgers were mediocre and mac n cheese was subpar. Portions are huge but strictly OK in terms of taste. Never going again!,0
"I shop often at this store and have never had a problem, until today. One of the managers there Rae (Chelsea) is friends with an ex boyfriend of mine. I have a restraining order against him. Rae texts my ex while I'm in the store shopping telling him I'm there. I get a text from my ex telling me to ""leave Rue 21 you're making Rae sick"". Obviously this really scares me because I don't know if he was in the store watching me or something. It was a terrible experience. I'm literally scared to shop at this store again.",0
Ok. First given old menu that did have fav sandwich.similar to philly cheese. Waiter then brought out new menu that had the sandwich. Then sandwich was was dry with underwhelming bread. Advised supervisor. Not good period. Step up BJ!!!,0
"Let me start off saying that I've never written a bad review for any company before. This place sucks. I went to get a pedicure. The nail polish selection isn't great and most bottles are really low and crusty. I found a pink that seemed reasonable and was seated promptly at a chair which was nice. The seats were full and I was the last chair seated. I was literally the first one done if that gives you any indication on how this pedicure went. Almost every toenail wasn't completely painted (edges missed) or my toe was painted. Not a little paint on my toes, but big globs. I moved to the drying chairs and looked my toes over. Which were terrible. My technician had already moved on to the next client, so I grabbed the bottle of nail polish and fixed my nails. I know I should have complained but they were so busy rushing people around that I just decided to go to CVS across the street and bought a top coat and nail polish remover.Terrible, terrible, terrible! I will not be a returning customer.",0
Worst gym I've ever been to. DO NOT get a membership here. Horrible equipment and staff is very cold and rude. Never go here. I have been a member for 2 years at the 24 hour fitness in San Diego and the service there was so much better. You will be signing a contract with the devil by going here.,0
"Looking at other reviews and agree that their customer service has declined significantly over the last 5 years. Called on 1/10 to get my smart meter replaced with the old analog. Yes, I'll pay the extra $5 a month and the $50 change out fee. But first, they insisted I had an analog meter. I went back outside and nope, it was a smart meter. Called again.(Oh, and they always have to call you back, they're too busy to talk.) Again they lied and said I had an analog. I reminded them that I was looking at the meter as we were speaking and it was a smart meter. Twenty minutes on hold and they finally agreed with me. Set a date of 1/15 to replace it. Called today, 1/18, and they said it will be 5 more days, they think. ""They're not sure, they will work me in."" How are they a service company? And while I am at it, with 3 APS accounts they continuously put my electronic checks in the wrong account and then accuse me of being late on my bill! I finally decided to fund each account with a certain amount every month just to keep up with the carelessness. Something is wrong with their management system if they don't know which account I'm paying and what kind of meter I am looking at. Help us, Corporation Commission!!!",0
"We came tonight to use a coupon we bought, and I should have read the most current review before I bought the coupon. Just like the other reviewer, we arrived and waited at the hostess stand... and waited... and waited. I poked my head around to the bar side and the dining room side and saw people working (and eating), but no one ever came to the hostess stand. A waiter even walked by us twice on his way out to the patio and back in, and he never even acknowledged us. After 10 minutes of waiting, we cancelled our reservation on OpenTable and went to Vine, where we had a fantastic experience. Now I'm stuck with a coupon I don't even want to use because I have no interest in going back.",0
The young Chinese girl the cashier is RUDE. Asked a simple question if I can substitute the bbq chicken with chicken Katsu. She looked at me like I was stupid and answered back with attitude NO. Sitting there eating our food and she never checked up on us if we were ok but she checked up on other people in the restaurant. Gave the other people their bill with fortune cookies and she came to give us our bill and my son said how come we didn't get fortune cookies. My son got up himself and grabbed it SMH. I will stick to L & L Hawaiian BBQ.,0
"By far the worst place to live in all of Phoenix/Arizona. I would NEVER recommend anyone to live at this apartment complex. The parking is ATROCIOUS as they NEVER have parking spots available past 8pm. There is no street parking, so if you cannot find a spot you are SOL. The managament is the WORST that I have ever dealt with, as they take FOREVER in assessing any fees or fines. I moved out in 2010 and received a fee in 2012 for a ""cleaning"" that they needed to do, even though they signed us out of the apartment and have other tennets living in the apartment that I occupied. The management, especially Lisa Nolle, are EXTREMELY unprofessional and are as rude as can be. They are never clear on what they are charging you for and they could care less about any problem that you are having. All they are interested in is your money, not your well being. If they cared about me half as much as they care about my money, I'd never move out. Let me just say, not living at this apartment anymore is the BEST thing that's ever happened to me.I would not recommend anyone to live here. It's a waste of money and is a terrible apartment complex. There are 50 other places that I would recommend to live. There is NOTHING around this apartment complex (food, entertainment, etc.), so living here is like living in an annex. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT live here.",0
"Back on 12 Jun 08 I purchased 6 each Denise Extension Cords. They only had 4 of the 6 cords I wanted and the owner promised to mail me the other two. Since Jun, I called twice and e-mailed twice. Each time I was told it was coming from the Denise factory. I called the Denise company and they told me they did not get any such order from Knit Las Vegas. I have called Knit Las Vegas in Jul, Aug, and Sep and it is still not resolved. I have been calling daily in Oct at different times of the day and they will not answer the phone since I figured out they must have caller ID. I finally had my girlfriend in LV call and lo and behold, they answered the phone. I tried calling immediately after my girlfriend called and they did not answer the phone! So buyers beware, do not order or pay for anything in advance as Knit Las Vegas will take your money and run!I have reported this place to the BBB of Las Vegas. I have now filed a complaint with the Nevada Consumer Affairs Division as advised by the BBB since my complaint went unanswered.",0
"I'm a big Chop Suey fan but its not a lunch special  so I ordered off the regular menu, I can't say I was impressed, although the veggies were crunchy there wasn't much flavor to the sauce.The booths are dirty and this old building is in great need of a remodel.  I wouldn't have ever stopped in if it weren't for some glowing reviews by other Yelpers.To top it off there was constant yelling or arguing coming from the kitchen and a man putting boxes together behind a screen in the dining room, ever heard one of those loud tape dispensers throughout your meal!?I visited this location off it's previous reviews and I have to say they disappointed me.",0

"I have been a AAA member for 18 years. My daughter had battery problems and I told her to call AAA for a jump. She was told battery was dead and she needed a new one. Living in Az my whole life, I concurred and told her that was fine. Here is where i am upset.  ""Dustin K"" the service tech decided to dupe my daughter and put a premium performance battery in her 2014 Jeep Wrangler for a price of $189! That's absurd! There is no reason to put this expensive of a battery in her vehicle. Dustin is a little crook and I've reported a complaint to AAA. I hope AAA will do the right thing and refund me the difference or I will not be renewing my membership. Beware of these battery guys! AAA sub contracts them and they are shady, especially Dustin K!",0
"Don't plan on getting picked up by Yellow if you are in Lawrenceville past midnight. I waited for over an hour for Yellow Cab on a visit two months ago and the driver never showed. We ended up getting a ride by a mysterious guy who drives a car with no cab markings named ""Mr. C"" or something. Last weekend we were in the process of waiting over an hour when I decided to download the Lyft application. I had a ride lined up, an ETA and an actual conversation with the driver within minutes.",0
Wow I've been calling for the past 2 days and I still can't get a hold of anyone... I left several of messages and still have not heard nothing back.. from looking at the reviews I'm sure Staci McHale is great but her staff can't even return a phone call? Not a good look for the office.,0
"I used to go see Ben, he's a chill person and does good work.  We typically schedule for a time that works best for both of us as he stays steady compared to others renting chairs in that shop.  This most recent time we schedule, I was literally two minutes late and he had already started on the next guy that was scheduled 30 minutes after my time slot or scheduled time.  I had my baby with me, drove 45min One-Way and we had an appointment immediately after elsewhere with enough drive time to plan ahead but since I was 2min outside my window....Ben had another agenda, thanks Ben you clearly are ""for the customer"" and ""not your own"" agenda or ""pocketbook"" I'll find a new barber.  Guess my business wasn't really needed anyway!",0
Tried the veggie burger today. Wasn't great. I've had better for sure. Don't think I'm coming back anytime soon. Disappointed,0
"Stopped here as this was a cafe and not a full sit down restaurant to grab a quick bite. I knew that it was going to be a little pricey given the area, but I was very unimpressed by the price one my food came. I ordered a $16 crepe with egg, avocado, and cheese.It took over 20 minutes for the crepe to be prepared. When it finally was, I asked for it to go, as we had reservations somewhere else. I took a bite and the crepe itself was cold, which means it had been sitting out awhile. The avocado was actually guacamole, and I don't know where the cheese was.Will not recommend this place.",0
ZERO STARS went to have breakfast this morning waited over 15 minutes after being seated to flag someone down to please help us with drinks and order. Table next to us came after us and had same waitress as us and had drinks and order in. Finally decided to leave this zoo of a place and eat across the street. Don't waste your time with ever going to this place not worth it.,0
"This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill.  Unfortunely for you, I'm a bit more educated than your average diner.  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.  First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.  Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that ""Kung Pao"" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.  I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean????? g? oz? tsp? tbs? cup?  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.   YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again.",0
"I have been here several times and love the food. Tonight, we (my husband, myself and our son) ordered our food and four people got seated next to us. One of the patrons was drunk and obnoxious. He was dropping f bombs and used the p word several times. Half way through our meal,  I excused myself and went to the front and requested to go boxes and our check so we could get out of there. I was afraid that if we had to sit there any longer, words would have been exchanged and things would have got ugly. What a total disappointment.",0
"Last time I went it was about 3pm on a weekday and there were 3 guys sitting at the bar Ttalking with a male bartender.  I stood there for approx 5-7 mins before I was even acknowledged.  Needless to say, they haven't gotten any more of my business",0
"I wish I could give this place ZERO stars. We had family visit us from the United States and decided to bring them to this restaurant as we had heard great things. Upon arriving, the host directed us to our table which happened to be by the door. We asked if we could move to another table because people were coming in and out it was very cold. The host told us to wait a moment and we were happy to do so, as other people were seated. A few minutes later, a man who I can only assume was the manager came and told us that that was the only table he had and that if we didn't like it we could get lost. An absolutely terrible way to deal with prospective clients. We took our guests to Mundo, another Italian restaurant on the West Island. The staff and the food there was amazing: if you are craving Italian food I highly suggest Mundo over this garbage fire of a restaurant.",0
"UPDATE:  Looks like the health department can confirm my personal experience.  5 negative findings on their most recent inspection (http://phoenix.about.com/library/blrestinspectbad0613.htm). Meanwhile, the owners keep messaging me to get me to delete my review.Oh Curry Corner.  I loved you since the day I met you.Your takeout orders were usually wrong.  But I forgave you, for each time I came inside, my food was just right.I was wierded out by your self-service beverages, and your water always tasted so awful that I drank tea or soda.  I figured it was a ploy to sell drinks, and I was OK with that, because your food was so cheap and so delicious.I was excited to come in last week to find Guy Fieri's visit (can't stand the dude...wtf is with his hair...SERIOUSLY) prompted a major renovation.  Gone were the mostly disgusting and crappy booths near the kitchen.  Hardly an improvement to remove booths and replace with tables and chairs, but this was.  They cleaned it up. And it looked great!Well, I was pumped that my friend, who is mostly an Indian food virgin, enjoyed this place and his first foray to the cuisine.  So much so, that (well, until he reads this review) I couldn't bear to tell him what I saw when we checked out.A roach.  Not a dead one.  One still clinging to it's life.  Legs in the air like he just didn't care.I immediately bugged (ha!) my friend who had originally turned me on to the place to tell him my woeful tale of a roach at Curry Corner.  OH, he said?  I saw one the last time I was there, but I assumed it was just a fluke.No.  It was not.  And no thanks, CC.  I'm over you.",0
"So, every time I've been here it's been wonderful. This time (tonight) was ridiculous, we (my 1 1/2 yr old and myself) had a server we've never see or had before, and she was very forgetful and slow, even though she was running around like crazy. Weird since there was only 3 other tables that had people and two other servers/bartender. She messed up my drink order, our food came out cold, my sons cheese wasn't even close to melted in his grilled cheese. She forgot his milk twice and I finally had to ask a 3rd time, and she finally remembered. I had to wait about 20 minutes after I was finished eating for her to even walk by so I could ask for boxes. She brought them and forgot to drop off the check. Another 15 minutes after that she brought it out, finally. To top it off, when I left she asked ""you got it?"" From all the way across the dinning room, just standing there, as I was trying to open the door carrying my kid, diaper bag, purse and boxes.... ""yeah I got it""... wtf. But whatever I guess, we will still come back here as long as we don't ever get her again. Oh and I forgot, she gave me a nasty ass look out the front windows as she saw the tip I left.",0
"We went to waisted grain super excited to have a fun filled Saturday night. We went up to the top bar, and got drinks & started dancing. After 30 minutes or so a security guard asked us to leave because apparently it was a private party. He pushed my girl friend the whole way out the door, made false accusations about her slapping someone, AND flipped us off. I get its a night club, but where is your professionalism?! Buddy, if you were doing your job correctly we shouldn't of been able to get into the private party! NOT our fault we didn't know it was a private event due to the fact it wasn't closed off and there was no security! Because of that there was  no reason for his power trip or for him to push around a woman so aggressively.",0
"Rob Richards is all over you like flies on honey prior to the $2000 sale, but then ignores your emails and phone calls afterwards. Customer service after the sale was horrible to non-existent. He promised to have RJ install a bypass valve in October 2015 due to air suction problems that occurred in the beginning of September 2015, right after installation. After leaving many more messages and emails, Pureion finally came out to fix the issue seven months later, but I had to endure being yelled at, belittled, and accused of lying by an egotistical maniac.  They tried to shift the blame to me saying that the Shasta Pool experts incorrectly installed the bypass valve when they installed my pool in 2007, and that I somehow should have know that.  I believe they are just using that as an excuse, because my system only started sucking air immediately after the Pureion Wave was installed and I have the emails to Rob to prove it.  It also begs the question as to why they did not advise me it was supposedly improperly installed when they first installed the Wave.  Somehow I was supposed to know, but the owner/supposed expert didn't even notice it.  Without asking for any pictures, Rob said I needed a bypass valve and promised his company would take care of it to restore my system to the same functionality as before the system was installed. He subsequently ignored several follow-up emails and phone calls.  Only seven months later has this issue finally resolved.  The owner fixed the air suction issue and replaced the ion probe under warranty.  Knowing what I know now, and having been treated so poorly by this company, I would have never done business with this company in the first place. They seem to see the customer as no more than a dollar sign.  Buyer beware!",0
"It's one thing to have the right product and inventory,  but without the knowledge and customer service, that sweet item can turn sour real fast. If you're looking for anything wedding related; engagement rings or bands, do your research ahead of time because you WON'T be assisted with the purchase here, other than to take your money. It seems the company does not care about humanity or human regard; they make a mistake and blame it on you and their answers are never consistent.  That's one way to tell the difference between someone experienced and just a plain, old shady operation. As married people know, the engagement is the most special time for the couple and making a bad situation, good, would seem like the obvious thing to do... Not in this Jewelers case, unfortunately. Pay attention to this review. I know they may have pleased some patrons, but look at the number of reviews they have in relation to other Jewelers.. For the number of years they claim to have been in business, the amount of reviews (although fair) is weak. Also keep in mind, my opinion is based on an engagement ring experience so who knows, they may be decent on other items, like watches but don't trust them with your engagement!",0
HORRIBLE service.  The salesperson makes a good pitch and gets you to sign for a high-end pool but they cannot deliver the services in a timely manner.  It's always one excuse after another why they can't be onsite working on the project.  No communication between the Project Manager and Superintendent.  They don't even know when trades have been at the property and if the specific task was completed.Do yourself a favor and spend your hard-earned money with another pool company!,0
"If I could give 0, I would.  I went to one of their sales pitches. I was promised a ticket to Michael Jackson ONE which is cirque de solei. They told me the presentation was 90 mins it was actually 3 HOURS! Then when I get done they give me a ticket for Michael Jackson live which is a dirt cheap imposter. I told them the situation and they refused to make it right.  They told me one thing and wrote down something different BAIT AND SWITCH.  They had me initial the paper work in 15+ places including where they wrote MJ Live.  Apparently despite the conversation you have with the booker you must read every last word or you get taken advantage of.  They gave me back 46$ for 3 HOURS of my life by that time MJ ONE was sold out.  I was so disappointed and will NEVER BUY A TIME SHARE OR STAY IN THEIR HOTELS AGAIN.",0
"This is literally the silliest place I've ever seen.  I stopped in here one night because I didn't feel like cooking, and I thought I'd try the new pizza place on my block.  When I placed my order I was shocked at how quickly I was handed my pizza.  I'd say it was under a minute.  My pizza, however, was frozen!  I was dumbfounded.  The cashier instantly saw my disbelief and assured me that this is the ""best pizza in the world"".Well, I can assure you that it isn't.  I'm not going to go so far as to compare this pizza to NYC or NJ.  I'm not even going to compare this ""pizza"" to Vegas powerhouses like Pizza Rock or Novacento.  Actually, I'm not going to compare this to Little Caesar's hot n' ready because:1. Little Caesar's bare minimum pie tastes much better2. Little Caesar's hot n' ready comes hot, ready, and NOT FROZEN!!I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that people order take out because they don't want to cook.  If I have to go out, grab food, bring it home, and still cook it; it would make sense to just pop in a Digiorno's.. which also tastes better than Papa Murphy's.",0
"First off this review really should be for Jan 2015, but I didn't have Yelp then or at least wasn't on it enough. I ordered a 9 oz steak from here for pick up. First it was ready 30 minutes later then the pick up time so I was stuck waiting in my car. Then I got home and my steak was was medium well when I wanted it well done and made that very clear on the phone, because I was 4 months pregnant and we all know the dangers of raw meat. So I was starving and tried to cook it for longer to get it to well done in my oven when I really should have thrown it away. I got the worst food poisoning of my life...and I was pregnant. Make sure that you cook the food according to what the person asks for and also something else must have happened from it sitting that long for me to be that ill. Needless to say I will never ever go back to this location again.",0
"My sister and I were there a few months ago. the staff was completely disgusting and rude, as well as the management. My sister was sexually harrassed by our guide James when we had stopped out on our tour. We asked if there was anyone that was a manager we could talk to about him and our shuttle driver informed us that he was the manager on site and that we needed to make a formal complaint at the shop. Unfortunately the manager at the shop was ""too busy"" to deal with a very serious complaint towards someone on his staff. I would never suggest anyone go here.",0
"Came out and did a 10 minute job changed a dual capacitor, charged $75.00 trip charge which is normal, but then charged $140 for a $10.00 part for a total of $215. I wasn't home at the time so I texted Mark and his response was ""Dual capacitor. Sent receipt now. No that price is lower than almost any competitor out there. You're not paying much for the part but for the service and ability to repair. Sorry if that seems high but I assure you we are lower than most companies. I really don't know what to tell if that's what you think. We are a licensed and insured contractor and have to make a living. I used to work for companies that charge much more than that to do the same repair. We have other costs involved other than the part itself. Vehicles, tools, insurance etc. I'm sorry you're not happy with our work"" Mark it's not that I'm not happy with the work, it's the fact that you double dip on the service charge apparently. A honest company would charge trip charge + 1/2 hour minimum labor for 10 minutes @ 70 a hour + part= really shouldn't have been more than $140. You work out of your home office, don't have a website and can't provide a bill on the spot, instead have to wait until your guy gets back to you to email a receipt and have to be reminded to send one. Just charge fair prices, don't take advantage of people.",0
"Buyer beware! Game Crafter is a horrible company to work with. If the flimsy card stock (which they CLAIM is the same as MtG), card drift, and tonal coloration weren't bad enough, it was all made 10x worse by the horrible customer service. No empathy. No helpful resolution to these issues. Just ""You ordered them, so you are SOL."" How rude! Thanks, Game Crafter. Over $100 down the drain. Never again. -.-",0
