"The first time I walked into Basso, I was totally in love with the atmosphere.  The menu, I wanted to try everything!  I fell in love with the Beef tenderloin that I decided on.  The knife just melted through the meet.  The pasta, OMG, I love the Spaghetti and Meatballs, the sauce was perfect and the meatballs were melt in your mouth.  The service was great, friendly staff, great place to go with your friends, a night out with your other half, or just drop in and have a bite.  The brunch is an added bonus on the weekends.  I have tasted many of the brunch items and all are by far the best I have ever had.  If you live or work in the area, or not, take time and see what you are missing!  Its a hidden gem on Queen St E",1
"Amazing coffee, amazing breakfast tacos and all of the employees were nice. I'm still dreaming about this tacos. Eggs, hash browns, salsa and green chilis. Yum!!!Easy to find a table to sit at on a Sunday mid-morning (there were three of us.)Did I say the coffee was amazing? Omg! Loved it. I took another cup to go. Wish they were in Los Angeles. I really love independent coffee shops.",1
"I'm not much into the shopping experience. I don't hang out at malls and browse through stores without an action plan. I generally like to get in, get what I need, and then get out.However, there's something very delightful about strolling through Tempe Marketplace. Even when it's hot outside, there's so much shade and clouds of mist wafting through the air that it's easy to forget you're in the middle of a desert. Tempe Marketplace is more like an oasis. The pace and energy of the place is more akin to an amusement park than a shopping mall. Now, I've never been there during the busiest of times; but as far as a quick mid-week shopping trip, this place can't be beat. It's like a mini vacation away from real life.",1
"My encounter with Banzo was inspired solely on a craving for falafel and a whim as I passed their food cart on Dayton St. They only take cash -- so I had to defer but I'm glad my craving won out and I stopped by.The falafel was crisp without being burnt and exactly the right flavor that good falafel should be-- you could taste the chick peas clearly, the spicing was noticeable, great, but not overpowering so it ultimately balanced out very well. It was also decidedly inexpensive. I don't know that it made the food taste better but it definitely makes me feel better about indulging!I also ordered their chicken pita (just a half so I didn't explode) and that was every bit as good as the falafel. They didn't overload it with vegetables, just enough so that you got a little bit of the vegetables, you got their marinade (which is amazing), and the chicken. No ingredient felt like it was ""just there""... it all worked together. The chicken, flavor aside, was delightfully tender.All this from a cart, no less.Needless to say I will *definitely* be coming back again.",1
"We started using Four Paws when we recently moved to Ballantyne.  Great physical facility, clean and safe for dogs with ample room to run and play.  Most importantly though, the staff is mature, friendly and loves dogs.  We have used a number of day care services in Charlotte and Four Paws is at the top of the list.  Until our older girl died we took both our dogs and the staff took extra care with our almost 19 year old who was blind, deaf and at the end had difficulty walking. They did not blink at all when she came over and took great care of her.  We continue to take our 16 year old Jack Russell and they welcome him with open arms.  He loves it and comes home thoroughly played out.  They have been keeping a close eye on him because of the loss of his sister.  Couldn't ask for a better team and facility.",1
"I liked the Panang curry, actually had some vegetables in it and plenty of chicken. Crab Rangoons had crab in them, normally there is just cream cheese. Service is great will go back soon",1
"I think that Brick Works may have grown since Linda went there last year, or maybe it is busier right now because it is prime farmer's market season. I would say this is one of the best markets I have been to in Toronto. First of all the whole area is beautiful. It is an evergreen project and they have done an amazing job of preserving the natural beauty of the site. The actual farmers market happens every Saturday from 8-1. However, I noticed things started to wind down by around 12: 30 ,so I would recommend getting there a little early. The space isn't huge but they pack a lot in. First of all there are FREE SAMPLES EVERYWHERE. I planned on buying lunch, but honestly got quite full on all the free samples. The fry guy that Linda mentioned is actually Jamie Kennedy. He was there making sweet potato fries and serving them. I didn't try any but I think I was the only person in the place without a cone of fries. Lee also had a booth and was serving some sort of Asian slaw. Looked beautiful! Other highlights for me included the mustard guy. ( I love mustard) I would definitely recommend the horseradish mustard. It has a great kick! They also had a bunch of delicious looking glutton free baked goods, organic chocolate, amazing pickled vegetables, every stinky cheese you could imagine and of course seasonal fruits and veggies Great Saturday morning activity! One warning...there is not a lot of parking available. I would definitely recommend biking!",1
Oh my godddd this place is beautiful!!!!Came here with my boyfriend for his coworkers wedding. It was set outdoors in front of the golf course and the banquet was inside. Even before we walked in the parking lot was filled with fancy cars and apparently there are Audis out for rent? I haven no idea. It was called Audi lane or something.There was also a celebrity golf tournament happening while we were there and apparently there were a lot of celebrity sightings! I'm not sure if the food was also catered by the Westin but it was really good! We had crab cakes and a risotto bar. Cocktails were really good but no Malibu or Kahlua haha. My boyfriend ended up getting food poisoning but has no idea from what since we basically ate the same things. Staff was always nice as well and very helpful. Theres a fire pit outside and the best views. I wish we had stayed here! But we never would've left our hotel if we did. It was twice the price compared to the Sheraton we stayed at but 10000x nicer. Definitely one of the best weddings I've ever attended.,1
"We recently moved from Seattle -- where there are just as many yummy teriyaki places as their are Starbucks -- and have had a hard time finding a great place for quick take-out teriyaki or sushi.Fortunately, we stumbled upon Yoshi Bento. The food is great and they have a few gluten-free options (GF beef teriyaki!) for our daughter -- which is awesome!I highly recommend this place. Check it out if you're ever in need of a teriyaki fix.",1
Great place. The service was incredible. Shoutout to Xavier for the service. The food is great. Highly recommend the guacamole with shrimp!!,1
"Ordered take out and did not get a chance to eat right away but the food was darn tasty even lukewarm. The Jalapeño Poppers were spicy as the seeds were not removed so watch out for that. The Truffle Parmesan fries did not disappoint. This side can easily be shared by two people. Also tried the Farm Burger medium well and Chili Hot Dog. The burger tasted better than the average burger and the hot dog stood out. The sausage was huge, no pun intended. I had to share it as I couldn't finish it myself. I'd recommend to try this place at least once.",1
My first visit in quite some time to a GP. I needed to get some referrals to some specialists. I was skeptical  after reading the bad reviews. Check in with reception was easy. She was very nice and soft spoken. I was the only one in the waiting room.  I was seen 10 minutes after my scheduled appt time...great for vegas standards. The normal weight and height and BP taken then the PA Richard saw me. Probably the most thorough exam I've had in years. He took time to listen to my concerns and we chatted a bit. I liked this guy. I didn't actually get to see Dr Allen but as long as I get taken care of and get what I need I'm OK with it. Got my referrals and out the door I went. I've found my new Dr's office. Oh and I got an appt the same day I called in.,1
Recommend!! This place is very new and just opened recently. Stopped by for some quick lunch and was blown away with the service and food quality. The BBQ and veggies were all very tender. Chicken dishes are saucy and crispy at the same time. Absolutely affordable and fast. Owner is very nice and gave me free soup to try. I highly recommend this place and will be back more often to try more items!,1
Nice and delicious restaurant around the corner !!! A must try for sure!!! Best I have so far!,1
"Came here for dinner with my friend while we were visiting phoenix. The ambiance of the place is pretty great. Nice and relaxed and beautiful scenery if you dine on their patio. We made the mistake of ordering two entrees and an appetizer because the portions were HUGE. We couldnt finish anything we ordered and had to take at least half our table home at the end of the night! Not only were the portions great, but the each bite was so flavorful. We also had a little yelp coupon for a free dessert and were not disappointed one bit! This place was a gem we stumbled on by accident and i wish we could go back for another bite!Also, they gave us a little complimentary dessert at the end of our meal as well! It was some kind of chocolate and it was exquisite! Needless to say, we were rolling down the streets back to our hotel from our overstuffed belliesss",1
"The signature chef tasting with paired wine offerings was the most delicious dining experience I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  Course after course arrived with not only delicately prepared tartar and flavorful steak topped with deliciousness, but served in unison with wines (and vodka) that made these generous morsels all the more giving of wonderful flavor.  The service made the experience feel even more special.  These words try but fail to express how satisfying the dining experience was at Michael Mina's.",1
Very helpful with our dog and taking time to respond to all my questions regarding my dog thank  you! And the girl doing the intake was very sweet,1
"Best Vegan  horchata  and vegan huevos rancheros , friendly service , I will definitely will be coming back.",1
"I love going to the Flybeats classes.  Great music, challenging core and arms workout, motivating instructor (Shane) and always a fun time. I always leave feeling energized and pumped :)",1
"We absolutely love Janine and her beautiful family! We started by bringing slacks for altering and have since been back for everything from button repairs to having our wedding gown and suit altered for our big day. I trust Janine to provide suggestions, reasonable costs, and do beautiful work. Her work is flawless and she has made me a customer for life. Thank you Janine!",1
"Had a fun time here last weekend.  Great cast, great ticket prices and great skits!  They sure keep your attention!  The servers are attentive also so I never had to go to the bar when we wanted more drinks.",1
"Great place to grab lunch. Was in Pittsburgh looking to eat somewhere so what did I do? I pulled out my iPhone and had it search for lunch places. This was he best one I saw, plus they took Apple Pay! Always a bonus.",1
Absolutely love this place Kelly takes such good care of me when I do in and does the prettiest nails,1
"Charmante petite épicerie italienne authentique dans le Mile-End avec choix de sandwich/paninis et autres desserts typiques comme les canollis (ricotta sucrée, tiramisu ou limencello - le dernier est vraiment bon!). Les sandwichs sont simples mais bons et le café espresso est vraiment excellent. Le tout servi par un propriétaire à l'accent chantant. On y retourne.",1
What the heck?!?! Why did I wait to get the munchies before trying this place? My only complaint...I should have ordered more! My mee favorite place!,1
"Get here early, they don't take reservations. Don't be mislead by this tiny spot- the food is authentic and totally on point! Sit with Amanda, she's the greatest!",1
What a delightful surprise! I am in the middle of job interviews and needed to find someone who could improve my look. My hair hasn't looked this good in a long time. I also enjoyed the positive vibe of the place. I will definitely be back!,1
New place on South End with very very fresh food. Menu has many selections to meet your cravings and well lit for evenings. Place has a parking lot and street parking so no worries there. Price is just right compared to other businesses. Definitely worth.,1
Great atmosphere and everyone is so kind and very clean. The Steak Bites and the Tuna are to die for. They are great appetizers to split you can't go wrong with anything there everything you get is amazing give it a shot.,1
"Researched several tattoo places in Las Vegas and decided to see Orlando at Skin Design. The professionalism, and skill he puts into his work is above and beyond what you would expect. Very clean shop with a staff that cares about their work and that you are completely satisfied. I am not artistic and had an idea of what I wanted and Orlando drew it and it is awesome! Will be back for future tattoos and recommend to all. Love my tattoo!! Thank you!!",1
Horchata on the fountain is going to get me everytime! So many different options and so many different combinations! I have to try them all. Customization is unlimited! Great service friendly staff something different!,1
"First off I want to say that this place is cheap. My regular haircut and color costs me around $300+, but this place only costs me $120+tip. My hair feels great!they did a good job in making me look more beautiful! I will definitely come back!!",1
Came for a quick breakfast with my wife on our way out of Vegas.   Monday morning and still very busy.   It would have been a long wait but we scored seats at the counter.  Just watching the staff move back and forth was impressive.  A lot of moving parts and yet they all worked fast and efficiently.  I appreciate that.   This post is a shout out to all the employees!   You all are doing a fantastic job!,1
They have a variety of wonderful crafting supplies. It's always super cool to go online and pull up a 50% off coupon and show it in your cell phone to the cashier for the lovely savings.,1
"If I were to have a trade show or convention, I would definitely pick the Direct Energy Centre.  I attend the Runner Expo this past weekend for the Scotiabank Toronto Marathon.  The hall was brightly lit and spacious.  I was impressed with the organization of the booths and the race kit pick up lines.Beware - parking and food like all convention centres are at a premium, but this is expected.I look forward to future trade shows at the Direct Energy Centre!",1
"Best PC bang I've been to. Fantastic PCs, peripherals, and WiFi for a decent price. Great service and offers a variety of games to play. Also provides drinks and snacks! Highly recommend!",1
"We've been to Red's on several occasions and the food is delicious, the view is beautiful and the service has always been great. It's definitely a step up from all the mediocre chain restaurants that surround this area.",1
"Fantastic restaurant! Great ambiance, attentive waitstaff and delicious food. The classical guitar player during dinner was amazing. Good prices as well. I will be back here often :-)",1
"Excellent menu. Server totally versed on food allergies.  Wide selection of gluten free menu items, even bruschetta and dessert. Had the turkey ricotta sandwich on gf bread. It was really good. My friend got the crumble cake dessert and it was scrumptious. Cool atmosphere. Would be great for a date. Will be back for the high tea too!",1
"This place is just across the street from my house, and thank god for that! Finally, some real NY pizza that is right every time. These guys have the crust right, the sauce right, and especially the attitude right. It's small, always full of customers, always busy, and the workers are having fun while slinging pies for you and me. It's refreshing to hear a curse word or two fly out of the kitchen especially when its followed by a genuine smile and a ""how ya doin?"" They are pretty good at remembering names, but who cares about that-- they get my pizza done the right way. They also have some of the best cavateli this side of New Rochelle, and their baked ravioli is superb. My Italian wife will not permit me to get the baked ziti as hers is the very best, but I'm sure it's good too. It's also one of the only places around where I can find my old favorite --Cel-Ray soda. That's right, celery flavored soda. If you don't believe me, then leave it for those of us who do -- the number one non-alcoholic drink to be had with good pizza. You want NY pizza? Go to Mama Mia's and eat!",1
Yea!!! Was able to get my glasses cleaned and fixed while I waited and then fell in love with another pair of glasses- smooth transaction and Ill be back!,1
"I was looking for authentic Bangladeshi food in Toronto for a long time and finally I found it here. I was there with my wife and another couple. Trust me if you are looking for the taste of kacchi biriyani from dhaka,this is the place. They prepare it with beef. The meat is tender and easily comes apart and rice is fragrant and cooked to perfection. It is served only on Friday through Sunday. Please call them before you go as the biriyani gets sold out often. I was so full after a plate of biriyani that I was not able to try any other dishes there, which I would like to do.They have been around for 5 years, I was amazed that I never heard about them. The owners work there. The husband works at the front and the wife is the mastermind behind all the recipes. They have the passion for food and loves it when people enjoy it to the fullest.",1
I had an absolutely awesome experience! Great coaches and teachers helping you along the way. Such a fun adrenaline rush! I highly recommend for anyone!,1
"Wow...if you are looking for a great date bar to take a lady for a fine drink and want to set the mood....this place is definitly at the top of the list for me and you would be wise to place it on yours as well.  Super dark, swanky, candles, couches,great dj and some nites they have live acoustic.  If your date is not into you by the end of the evening at this place she never will be my man.  I am pretty sure if Tiger had a mistress in Phoenix and didnt want to be seen he would take her to Merc Bar.",1
"BEST FACIAL EVER! Christine is amazing!!!!!!! I felt calm, relaxed, and my skin has never looked so good! Can't wait to go back.  Don't even think twice about going to see her.  BOOK NOW!",1
"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but in this case I felt compelled to recognize Gerber Collision for the excellent service I received. My vehicle was brought in after a recent auto accident. From day 1 until the repairs were completed, everyone I dealt with at Gerber was great. The front desk staff greeted me with a warm smile and processed me in & out quickly. My estimator, Maria, was courteous, professional and kept me informed every step of the way until repairs were completed. I was extremely pleased with the speed of service in which the repairs were completed. Once the parts came in for my vehicle, all work was completed a week earlier than initially quoted. I am extremely happy with my experience with Gerber, considering the circumstances. If the need arises in the future, I will certainly use Gerber again. And I recommend you do too!",1
"soft or punishingmassage for every preferencebendies by riverAn asset to life in Cleveland's Warehouse District.  A yoga studio and massotherapy place at the bottom of St. Clair hill.  The atmosphere is kinda new agey asian and quite calming.  A variety of massotherapists work out of here doing everything from Thai massage to some seriously deep tissue work.  Ask for your preference.  I'm not a yoga person, but they do a lot of that here as we'll.  this is a good place to go for stress relief of all kinds.Carry on.",1
"Not sure why the bad reviews - our waitress, Crystal was awesome!  Service was spot-on, food was plentiful and delicious.  Recommend the fish and chips and warmed South Side Deli sandwich.  Spring for the  $2 charge for the onion ring upgrade - well worth it!",1
"This is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants that I have been to. It is very spacious however, the tables are still close together. The food was amazing and the service was even better.",1
Best Mexican hands down. Their condiment bar with different spice level sauces are to die for.,1
"This is the second time I have been here... Service is great and very nice atmosphere.  It's nice to have a quality place, quality owners and no fly's!!! Don't miss Loco at all.",1
The customer service here is very good! All the workers seem very happy and very appreciative of your time. They are usually pretty fast & friendly. Love the workers here.,1
The atmosphere of this restaurant invited me in but the real story is the great food.  I had the Cedar Salmon and my husband had the Fish and Chips.  I recommend both dishes.,1
This is our spot for Thursday Night Football! Melissa our server is THE BEST!!! We roll deep and she always makes us TOP priority! Love it here!,1
"I have to say I really loved this restaurant. The food was great. I got the signature dish, Nonni's chicken & it was delicious. So tender with a fried polenta cake. The squash blossoms were amazing too! I loved the decor & the people were very friendly. If you're ever in the area check it out. It's kind of hidden, but that's what makes it a gem.",1
"Great FOOD and SERVICE with no wait!  We ate here twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast on our Las Vegas vacation.  Tasty dinner and breakfast.  EXCELLENT service from JULIE for breakfast!  Also good dinner service from TABATHA!",1
"Grace was an incredibly passionate and fun trainer.  She whipped through the material in the few hours we had (I took an Adult First Aid and CPR certification class) but it did seem like we could have spent 3 days covering everything.  But it was great and we had lots of material to take home and review with more time if we wanted to.  Highly recommend Caskey CPR - (I had been a little sketched out by their website, but was pleasantly surprised by the class).",1
"Toronto's best bubble tea. Affordable, good pearls, heavenly milk foam americano. Keep it up!",1
I always love coming to Harold's. Ryann is the best bartender Ever!! That's why we come here!,1
Pokedon just opened across the street from my apartment which is dangerous. I've been there multiple times already so I'm thankful they have stamp cards to earn a free bowl! I always stick with a mix of brown rice and mixed greens with spicy tuna and tuna. They let you try all the sauces and most toppings are free and they don't mind when I ask for a little extra of some of them. It is very clean and sanitary inside and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend giving this place a try if you love poke bowls because they don't disappoint.,1
great food  and good service definitely a nice bar with a lot of action,1
"Best breakfast in town!It has a very country atmosphere to it. Being that the name has to do its Black Bears----the place is decorated wi lots of bears that includes statues, dolls, and toys. Some of the most friendly staff that I have had serve me while sting too. The staff all assists you on things such as refills or taking dishes off the table. All smiles and personality!If I have to recommend one thing to eat/drink, it has to be the Huckleberry ice cream! This is the only place in town that has Huckleberry ice cream and also does fantastic ice cream shakes. It takes just like the huckleberry products that I have come from Idaho. If you come here, you have to try something with Huckleberry in one form or another.",1
Great place to eat. I love coming here everything is so good and the prices are reasonable. The bread is amazing.,1
One of the last places left in the vegas area where you can get a meal under $5 and not have the quality of your food suffer. Late night specials here are amazing!,1
"Been complaining of soreness in my neck and shoulders, so my bf suggested getting a massage when we were in Vegas.ENVIRONMENT: Located in Chinatown. It's in the same plaza as Raku and Kung Fu Tea! It's a very simple massage place. The building is old, but the place was relatively clean. The linen and towels that were used were in good condition and clean. SERVICE: We did the 90 min ""Signature Deep Tissue Massage"".  This was a great deal ($46 + $15 tip)!! My masseuse was awesome! She made sure she wasn't going too hard and really got into all of my tight spots.  They start with the foot soak and neck. Then move on to the head, back, and arms. It was a full body massage and it felt so good. When I first walked out, I felt sore but in a good way! OVERALL: It's been about two weeks since the massage and I've been feeling sooo good and definitely not tight like before. Would recommend if you're looking for a cheap, but good massage.",1
really impressed by this place. the decor stands out from other danforth alternatives.The service was also a standout. I would recommend the white truffle gnocchi with bacons and green peas!! enjoy!,1
I would highly recommend eating there. The food is really amazing. I would highly recommend you try the spicy chicken pasta. The waiter was also incredibly helpful. Absolutely wonderful.,1
My boyfriend and I have been coming to both Bomboba locations since 2013 and we love it! We recently tried their special spicy Pho which is now one of my favorite. I highly recommend this place!,1
"I've seen a LOT of magic shows on the Strip and this has to be one of the best. Shin Lim is a close up magician who does amazing card tricks. His sleight of hand is unreal. A lot of times throughout the show I thought ""how the heck??"". It was a wild ride.I sat in the middle of the theater. It's a little too far to see most of Shin Lim's stuff, so I did watch the TV screen a lot. If you want to avoid looking at a screen, you'll have to sit a lot closer, which excludes much of the theater. For his final act, the camera man blocks him, so sitting up close won't help you there, either.This is advertised as a Shin Lim show with ""special guest"" Colin Cloud, but I would say Colin is 40% of the show. He comes out to help entertain us when Shin is setting up for the new tricks. He does a lot of different mentalist type stuff. If you've seen ""Paranormal"" at Bally's, it is VERY similar stuff. I thought Colin was great, but just wanted to give a heads up for anyone who wants an exclusive Shin Lim show.If you're looking for the traditional ""make stuff disappear"" or ""floating props"" type magic, you won't find it here. It's mainly card magic and then the mentalist stuff. Which I think is a good change of pace for people. I will say that Shin Lim is only card tricks, so if you're expecting something else out of him, you'll probably be disappointed.If you're a skeptic of magic, I'd recommend checking this show out, if only to figure out ""how did they do that?"". I'm still scratching my head with most of the tricks.",1
Awesome place. Came in to get my car oil change received good service. Walking around the lot looking at cars and all the salespeople are really friendly. I looked at the jeeps and Chrysler 300s it's going to be a difficult decision. Hopefully the price is right and I can purchase both cars. Fingers crossed and hopefully everything works out well.,1
"Let's start with the basics:  It's a sandwich shop, so how hard can it be to get things right?  There's only something like 17 billion of these stores in town now, right?  So what makes this one stand out?Being an avid lover of the ""sammich"", I rotate regularly between Subway/Jimmy John's/Port of Subs/Earl/Firehouse, but this particular location is my favorite.  The staff is always nice and courteous and not once has my order been done wrong even when phoned in.  Over the years I've seen many of the same people working here, which is a good sign because places with heavy turnover are indicators that ownership/management cares little about the employee, which also tends to lead to poor customer service given that their ""people skills"" aren't terribly great..There are the little things I tend to look for since I eat so many sandwiches such as the freshness of the bread, quality of the meat, or having the meal drowned in too much mayo.  They never come up short at this location.Is the location and staff clean?  Absolutely.  There is nothing worse than seeing a worker covered in crumbs leaning to make your sandwich (which I've witnessed elsewhere at non-Capriotti's chains).  They simply do it all right here, and in fact, I'm leaving now to go get a sandwich!",1
This is one of the best restaurants in the area. You always get great food. The drinks are good. The service is very good. Make sure you have a reservation unless you do not mind to wait for long time.,1
Best tacos I've had in a long time!!! Felt like I was in Mexico! Great service and great taste!,1
My wife and I have love this place for the last 10 years. When we lived in Pittsburgh and her kids were little we would always make a special trip to either pepperoni pizza.,1
We had a wonderful time last night. Lori was A wonderful server she suggested many drinks and appetizers. We enjoyed them all and then we had dinner it was terrific,1
"When you see a $108 Peking Duck on the menu, you kind of have to just say fck it and order it!!! I've had many Peking ducks in my life w the bun and the wrap and tbh Mott 32's Peking Duck is exceptional. From start to finish, presentation to taste, it was one of a kind. The duck skin is something that I haven't experienced, so crispy and almost flaky. I think the Peking Duck is meant to be for at least 4 people, but I only shared it with my bf and we actually were able to finish it all. We even surprised our waiter haha bc he didn't think we could finish it. I didn't even notice I ate so much of it and that's how I know it was amazing because my bf and I were barely speaking. I also enjoyed the fact that we could make our own wraps ourselves and mix and match all the sauces. It's always a better experience to diy. Other notable items we got were the hot and sour xlb, Alaskan king crab vermicelli, and grilled sea bass. I haven't been to a restaurant in awhile where I don't have any complaints. The service, ambience, and food were all top notch here! *have to call and reserve Peking duck a day or two ahead of time",1
I went there with my husband yesterday. The very first time and it was awesome!! Jon was very nice and introduced the scene around us. We took it in the afternoon and I think it's better than the morning one because you can see the sunset as the balloon is going down. It'll be gorgeous! I really enjoyed! Thanks for Apex balloon!,1
Awesome food and really great service! Their portions are large so three to four dishes is more than enough to share for two. We got the tomatoes with whipped feta which was amazing! Definitely our favorite dish of the meal! The fried potatoes were also excellent. The bucatini was solid and the chicken was crispy and flavorful. Highly recommended and prices were very reasonable.,1
"THE BEST SERVICE FOR YOUR NAILS. I am obsesed with this place. I started going here about a year ago and never turned back. The service is always amazing and they take great care of customers. My full set of nails last about 6-7 weeks, usually because my nails have grown out. The dipping powder is magic, made my nails stronger and my nails never break. The qualiy of my nails are the same as they were on the day I got it done. I would 100% recommend this place to everyone.",1
Great experience for my wedding cake. She was very responsive to my questions and even met up with me to pick up my cake topper and cake flowers (I used silk because they're more food safe). Did a vanilla cake with butternut filling and fresh strawberries. Everyone said it was delicious and most people went back for seconds. If I did it again I'd probably skip the fresh strawberries and do jam so it wasn't so moist in the middle. Still delicious though. Would totally recommend and will hire her again in the future.,1
I have been able to get help with multiple signs for work. Raymond Owens is great to work with and always provides great pricing. He is always honest with me and I will keep using them for my sign needs. Thank you!,1
Great vibe and music. The food was delicious and interesting and my friends and I were pleasantly surprised at all of the options from the market fresh set up. I'll definitely be coming back!,1
Great stadium! Air conditioning in the top section is cold! However I bet it's great in the summer. I suggest going to an event here!,1
I'm from Chicago where gelato is everywhere and fantastic.. This little gem is the best gelato I've had in Arizona. Nice family owned business. The owners are friendly and the ambiance is cozy. The cakes and cookies are delicious as well,1
"We ordered takeout from Kiyo and were very happy! Sushi is fresh and delicious, portion sizes are fairly priced and we loved the combo options. I have been waiting for a great sushi place to come into this neighbourhood and this is it! A very welcome upgrade from Kibo. Can't wait to be back!",1
Had an awesome time last night. Great food. Great service. Hugh place to hang out with a bunch of friends. Nice patio. I recommend this place for any type of beer drinker.,1
"As you ascend up CatHouse's infamous staircase, you are clearly reminded why it's called CatHouse. The walls are lined with old burlesque and what looks to be brothel photos.

"Ahhhh Brio... sweet Brio....When I saw those pics of the beef carpaccio - I was sold. I didn't realize, however, the grand SIZE of this dish.... best bring a fellow foodie to savor this delicacy- it'll become a sweet memory for y'all... ""remember that one time we split an arms length worth of beef carpaccio??!! Yeah.. GUUUD TIMES!""Just go for it...My person & I ordered the same dish after much deliberation and bouts of indecision .... lol. We both ordered the pesto pasta and man.. A+. Had lots of vegetables & good amount of chicken... just all around GUUUD. highly recommend. But really- everything on their menu looked worth trying.. so I'm planning on swinging by for that. we also split a side of mashed potatoes ... auguuguh amazing.com.org.edu.uk.usa.gov AND we didn't forget dessert ... I forget the name of it but it was a chocolate cake filled with chocolatey liquid goodness... with some raspberries & vanilla gelato I believe !! I DIG IT.Our server was pleasant & polite .. it was a busy Saturday night so we were glad we made reservations ahead of time! We only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated ..YOU GO BRIO!",1
"LITERALLY some of the best bbq, i've eaten in a while. The meat is super tender and totally falls off of the bone. The ribs here are the true definition of finger lickin' good (; To top off the ridiculously great food, customer service @ this location was over the top! I come in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with a semi big party & we received exceptional service from the moment we walked in until we were ready to go. We had multiple employees check on us during our visit which I totally wasn't expecting from a small restaurant like this. As far as the size of portions, huge!!!!! Sitting between my mom and fiance, we chose to order two things & share, family style. We opted for the Brisket 3 Ways Smokin' Plate & the Rib Platter Special. After we were completely satisfied and full, we had about 2 full containers of left overs. SoOo sharing with someone is definitely an option when coming here (: OH! & there's a pretty decent variety of bbq sauces available & all pair very well with both the ribs and brisket. MY personal favorite was the sweet country girl but all were available to try near the beverage station (:",1
Just an awesome place to watch sports events. Staff is very friendly especially Dani at the bar who's always happy and smiling. The food is always good and fresh and the manager April is also awesome. I recommend this place to everyone.,1
"This is a great feed store with a large selection, everyone is very helpful. I get my feed from there weekly. It is easy to order items, much faster than the surrounding feed stores.",1
"So good. A nice warm treat for any day! We stumbled upon them by accident and wish they had a Santan Village location! Service is amazing, and the food is always made to order. This perfect little cafe is amazing!",1
"Fun place to go and explore.  The meats are a bit pricey and you have to make sure the fruit and veg you pick are the ones that go into the bag. However, its the experience that you really go for isn't it!!",1
Had lunch there today for the first time! Would definitely go back. The magic roll and poke bowl were delicious!,1
"I honestly can't say enough good things about the salon and the people who run it!   I have been going to Jeff (owner) for quite some time now and I can honestly say I've never had a better haircut ""experience"" in my life.  By experience I mean not only the amazing quality of his men's cuts, but the fact that he is so darn meticulous and almost OCD (in a good way!) about cutting hair.  I have been to many stylists in my life who can cut hair ""good"" but always seem rushed, like you are a nuisance and preventing more money they could be making.  The amount of thought and work he puts into catering to every clients specific needs and personality style is amazing.   Additionally, Jeff is truly a great and genuine guy who genuinely gets to know his clientele on a meaningful level, never making one feel like he's trying to make pointless small talk (something many other stylists I've been to rely heavily on and makes it seem more transactional than truly client based).  I have in the past months moved to Nashville away from my home in Pittsburgh, and next to family, the one thing I miss most is the rejuvenating and confidence boosting experience it was walking out of Nadia Salon each appointment.  I would never hesitate recommending this salon, and specifically Jeff, to any friends, family, and coworkers.   As I call to make another hair appointment in TN, I am a nervous wreck knowing It won't be at Nadia",1
"My wife is getting surgery here in about a month and her friend just had surgery last night so we stopped in to say hi to her and check the place out. First impressions are spot on! Free Valet Parking, a staff member playing a violin in the lobby area and everything was clean and spotless. We also ate dinner in the Cafeteria and it was delicious and super cheap (My wife and I both ate for about $10) I am glad she is getting her surgery done at this location. Easy to find as it's right off the 101 freeway and Shea",1
"Hands down one of my favourite brunch places in Calgary (and I've been to quite a few)!Expect to wait for a table on the weekend for brunch, unless you come early (close to opening). The ambiance and decor is modern hipster. Water is served in mason jars and there is booth, table, hip top, bar, and outdoor seating. Staff is extremely friendly and service is great. This visit I ordered the West Coast Toast and Eggs with a side of Hashbrowns. My meal was delicious! I highly recommend trying the Hashbrowns!! They are shaped in a triangular form made of sliced potatoes, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are BOMB! Do not go without trying them, you won't be disappointed!Previously, I tried the mushroom quiche and mushroom bennie, both of which were delicious. My boyfriend had the Chicken and Waffles. He said the chicken was very flavourful and tender and the waffles were soft and perfectly complemented the chicken along with the gravy and maple syrup. The portion is white large, and he had to package up what he couldn't finish. The Beltliner will continue to be one of my top places to go for brunch when I'm in Calgary. I haven't been disappointed yet!",1
"This was me and my sister's first time attending an aerial class and it was a great experience. The atmosphere and environment was inviting. The host was pleasant with greeting us by our first name. When the class started the instructor showed us what to do first than we were able to do it. It's not as hard as it seems. However, it does take a lot of upper body strength. The downside to it the curtains were a little musty but I guess that comes with the territory of having a lot of classes. Other than that it was a great class and I will be back again soon!!!!",1
"What a truly exceptional dining experience.   I had no preconceived expectations for this restaurant and chose it purely on walking by looking at the menu.  So happy the restaurant Gods intervened for this meal to happen to me.We started off not super hungry so ordered the pork belly pasta, grilled ocotpus, and the 4 course parallel tasting menu (between three of us).   oh, and added the German chocolate soufflé too!  All three of us were blown away by this meal.  Comments you would hear during the meal from each of us include ""This is the single best bite of pasta I have ever had"", ""The octopus is the most expertly cooked octopus I've had in years."", ""The orange mousse is the most surprisingly good dessert, I can't stop eating it.""   My personal favorite bites of the night were the lobster ravioli, pork belly pasta, goat cheesecake, and that caramel mousse!An absolute 5 start dining experience.   No culinary stone was left unturned and they mailed every dish with delightful perfection.  Can't wait to return!",1
I started seeing dr. Weingrow for weight loss two months ago. I'm down 22 lbs and I couldn't be happier. The staff is friendly despite the office being super busy I get in and out very quickly. The office manager Teresa is friendly and always around for any questions I may have. They ladies upfront always schedule me around my schedule. Dr w cares and is so friendly I refer all my friends and family now.Thanks to this caring office I am on my way to better health.,1
"I was traveling through Ohio when my alternator died. I was stuck in the middle of an interstate exit ramp at 3pm on a Friday afternoon with a dead vehicle, a wife, two kids and 800 miles yet to go. Google 'mechanics near me' and Mooney's popped up. Within 30 minutes of my call they had towed us, diagnosed the problem, and ordered us a part. We were back on the road within 90 minutes of the breakdown! On a Friday afternoon! They could have easily let us sit until Monday. On top of that, they charged us what I felt was a very reasonable price; they had us in a bad spot, and I would have paid almost any price to get home. Can't say enough about this place!",1
"I went to sign up for a new contract and to keep my phone number with my old carrier. I spoke with Steven and he was amazing! excellent customer service, he gave me discounts on some items and set up my phone with no problems.  you will never find that kind of customer service at any other verizon store.",1
"This review is long overdue. I've eaten here at least once every 1 1/2 weeks for the last 2 years and the pizza is always good. The staff is always friendly and the pizzas come out the oven piping hot and delicious. I prefer to dine-in since they have (2) flatscreen TV's and a comfortable atmosphere. One of these days I'm going to try something other than pizza, but the pizza is so damned good.",1
I have been going to Max for 10 years.  He is the best!!!  I have NEVER been disappointed. He always gives me exactly the color and cut that I'm looking for and exceeds my expectations. I will drive across town to go to him. He is always up to date on the latest trends and will add a little extra pizazz or wildness if asked for that upcoming Christmas party or event. He even follows up with a phone call or text to make sure you are happy with your results the next day.,1
Today was my first time there. I ordered the fried catfish and shrimp and loved it. Can't wait to go back tomorrow to try the fried chicken!!!,1
"Highly recommend. Live music on a Thursday. Good prices. Pretzels and fries with cheese were delish. Also had a chili dog and braut- so good. Good selection on beer average to high prices: ie: $6 for a Budweiser, but it's to be expected for a great location.",1
"Loved it! Microbrews, bbq wings, patriots football. Forgot i was in vegas. Staff was fast, cigar bar ain addition. pretty cool lil place.",1
"We heard about this place from friends and decided to drive across town to try it. So worth it! The donuts are so delicious and we especially loved the fruity pebbles one. They're fluffy and light, and not too sweet. The owner, Chhaya, was so awesome and pleasant to chat with.",1
"We tried B of B 2x when we went to vegas on separate ocassions.  It is really worth the money ( 50 bucks for 24 hour buffet of your choice)  if you try at least the top 3 buffet of the bunch:1. Carnival Buffet in Rio --its my favorite which has the widest range selection of food. I particularly like their clams, mussels, prime rib, shrimps, salmon, mexican, chinese, italian, and all kinds of desserts! did i mention their gelato is good?2. Spice Market Buffet of Planet Hollywood--has the best quality of food, with special mention of pre-cut crab legs (saves a lot of hassle of cracking it open), lamb kabobs, roast beef, ham. hmmm.. creme brulee anyone?! 3. Le Village Buffet of Paris -- their sunday brunch is not to be missed. smoked salmon, quiche, french toast, eggs benedict, bottomless mimosa. stand-out is their crepe station where you can order crepes and waffles with your favorite fruit filling. bon appetit!",1
"This is the best Melt out of the four. The portions can be too much and the drinks get pricey, but I always really enjoy myself. You can't ask for a cooler kitsch place with awesome comfort food.",1
"Mike was an amazing DJ! From the booking process, to the information stage, to the wedding - we had a fantastic experience. Our wedding guests couldn't stop talking about him! Thank you for making our wedding a beautiful experience! -Ashley & Chelsea",1
Great food and good prices!The chicken is always good and the beans are great. Go big and grab a tamale!,1
"I dined here May 17th, and I must say my experience was top notch. Our waiter was an absolute maestro at his work in making the table presentable and making sure all utensils had a shine to them! The food was cooked to perfection, I had the Kobe Beef Steak which was phenomenal! Hands down I enjoyed EVERY bite and I had never felt so satisfied after a meal such as this. Thank You, Jean Georges!",1
"I have worked with many property management companies and property managers and I must say, hands down, Teri is THE BEST property manager I have ever worked with. Extremely professional, friendly and her knowledge is impeccable! She's truly a gem. Thank you Teri for making our move so pleasant!",1
"Dr. K did a fantastic job quickly and accurately diagnosing my imbalance, and prescribing the appropriate supplements to support my healing process.  I felt much better within less than one week.  His kind and gentle manner is refreshing.",1
"Super expensive, but worth it. Watching each course prepared is like watching an artist paint a masterpiece.",1
"I cannot say enough positive things about my experience at the Cement Tile Shop in Scottsdale. The sales/customer service representative, Jill, was phenomenal! She not only took the time to truly understand what I was looking for, she walked me through their website and explained the entire process to me. The company does most of its business online, but this brick-and-mortar shop has many, many sample tiles to drool over and get your creative juices flowing. The choices are somewhat overwhelming, but Jill helps to narrow down choices, help order what you need, communicate delivery status, and provide installation information. In my particular instance, she bent over backwards to make sure we received the tile we desired in a timely manner and at the lowest cost possible. I highly recommend this store!",1
"Best steak in Vegas!  Had bone in ribeye,Huge portion!Excellent service! Ask for Charles.N  for your waiter, he will steer you to a excellent meal .Worth the money!",1
"I would go see this show again for sure! There's not a bad seat in the house (although I didn't test them all). The stage and effects (lighting, water, fire) are what you're hoping for when you think about a Las Vegas show.",1
Great service and delicious food. :) good cute atmosphere. there's also patio seating for times of the year when it isn't scorching hot outside!,1
"I was at the Foot & Ankle Clinic today. I was craving some really messy gooey nachos.They we're ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Really hit the spot. I just had surgery so I was looking for something instead of Re-hab food. I am in a wheelchair, and have a hard time getting around.The cashier delivered the food down the street for me. She took my debit card back to the restaurant and brought my card back to me.WHAT!!!!Who does that.Props to U all for having hard workers. I will definitely tell people about my experience.Keep the good food rolling!!!I'm a new fan.",1
"Great selection of new and used cars.  Sales team are really professional and don't use pressure tactics (shout out to Anthony).  Managers value customer loyalty and are willing to work to achieve a win/win for everyone (shout out to TJ).  The service team is top notch and provides tremendous after sale support and confidence (shout out to Matt and Keith). If you are looking for a used car, they have a good selection.  I have purchased three used cars and have been delighted each time. Classic Honda is a ""must visit"".",1
Best tea place in the area!! We had a small baby shower at the restaurant with a group of 11 and a kid. Adam went above and beyond for our group. We didn't feel a bit of rush with our group size and he's more than accommodating. We felt welcome and truly appreciate his professionalism in explaining the food and the tea. We fell in love with the decoration of this place which was so unique and cozy. The sandwiches and dessert was perfect!! We left our leftover in their fridge and we came back late and forgetting they were closing at 5. Adam waited us!! That was spectacular service! I will definitely come back another time for their tea set or try other things in their menu. P.S. great price!! I've been to fancier/more expensive tea shop and service and food was not even half as good.,1
"I've never had my cat groomed before, but Jeannie put him at ease and he took it like a champ! Jeannie's Grooming is a busy little joint, but they seem to be very accommodating as far as scheduling goes. I'll be back and definitely recommend this place. :-)",1
"I really enjoyed my time with Dr. Kalich! She ended up birthing my son and I am very pleased that it ended up this way. She is kind, patient and caring. Dr. Deane on the other hand - I did not like her at all. As a pregnant female, one should be treated kindly and kept stress free. Dr. Deane just argued with me all the time about how I was telling her that I felt. I pushed 42 weeks a few days before she would set up an induction. I kept telling her I was in pain and she did nothing but fight it. I had to bring my mother in to speak to her because by the time I had my last appointment, I was tired and almost physically unable to go at it with her... I would not recommend her. She is youthful and rude.",1
"As a professional foodie, I have to rate this restaurant as full star. The dishes are quite unique and delicious. The chef combined different cooking skills into one dish, so you may think the foods are really unique. The noodles is quite delicious and the steam bao pork is fabulous! You can actually note that the pork are freshly cooked. The ice cream tastes great as well. I would recommend just stay at the noodles bar. I went to the third floor once. They served more high-ended food in the third floor, so the price levels are pretty high. While the dishes were just ok, I would go to Bosk for the same price level. (BTW bosk is right next door.) The salad tasted great and the seafood were fresh. plz dress up if you want to go to third floor. Otherwise, you will look awkward... since everyone dresses up in this floor. Generally speaking, Definitely highly recommend!",1
Great service and product! Staff really know what they are doing. Will recommend to anyone!,1
"It was everything I expected, expensive, cute, and tasty! I grew up always going to Sanrio stores so I already knew their items were going to be expensive, and came with my wallet prepared (they give a 10% discount to locals!). I tried their Hello Kitty Macaron (fruity pebble flavored), Keroppi Macaron (mint chip flavored), Keroppi Donut (pistachio flavored!!), and the muffin looking pastry with custard in the middle and it was all SO DELICOUS! I also got an iced vanilla latte, which was nothing special, and tried my friend's strawberry lemonade which was very refreshing. I also purchased both t-shirts and the pink t-shirt's material is very soft and comfy. Both are also a little longer in length which is my only complaints but still super cute.There are many complaints about waiting in line and the weather....as if that's in the cafe's control. We went on a Sunday at 2:30pm and there was no line. Of course it was very hot outside but hello it's summer in Vegas, and people are complaining as if the cafe controls the weather. The cafe is right outside of New York, New York's doors and after you get your treats and take pictures just head  inside the cool hotel where there's plenty of seating with tables as you walk through the hotel!",1
"One of my favourite place to visit whenever I want a value meal, without spending too much money on something filling. This place is tucked away at the Food court of the Shoppes of Parkway. You can either dine there at the provided seatings or just grab it to go. Two of my favourites are the beef striploin and the chicken steak bento with their teriyaki sauce. Portions aren't the largest but it is more than enough for a filling meal, especially that it's only $8 for the protein, rice, veggie, salad and spring rolls. The services of the owner is also exceptional and is always very attentive of the customer after they have received their purchased meal.",1
"I saw Dr LaTowsky for the first time to have a small birth mark removed from my face that I was concerned about.  Her office was clean, new and easy to find.  Her staff were INCREDIBLY friendly and warm the moment I arrived from the front desk all the way through to the exam room.  Dr LaTowsky was wonderful.  She has excellent bedside manner, explained everything very clearly to me and the procedure was absolutely painless.  What impressed me the most is how carefully she executed the procedure to ensure that I would have minimal scarring on my face - and to make it unnoticeable to the naked eye.   I've already recommended her to two people just in the short time since I left her office.  I would go back without hesitation, I think the entire office is great!",1
"My Fiancé and I visited this location a little after 9 pm. Bill was the manager on duty. I ordered the outlaw ribeye my fiancé ordered a steak salad. After several terrible experiences at the Cranberry location we were a bit nervous trying this one.Our food was absolutely perfect, our waitress was on point, prompt, courteous and helpful. We could not have asked for a better meal! Very impressed. Well done longhorn of Robinson.",1
"I love Pie Me Over! They are so nice. I'm a vegetarian and it is so hard to find a delicious pot pie, but there's is amazing. Thanks so much.",1
"We did the Brilliant tour this last weekend and I have to say it was the magical experience of my life. I actually had no idea what the show was because I just bought whatever ticket was available for us to see on such short notice. I had chills from the minute the show started. The creativity, the story that the lights tell and the feeling you get watching the old signs ""light"" up was simply beautiful. We are even going to book a group tour for our wedding in a couple months because we want everyone to experience it! Go see it!",1
I'm not the biggest NASCAR fan but I still had a fantastic time.  Lots of information and hands on experiences. I especially liked the large staff of friendly and helpful workers.  The workers made a fun experience a great experience.  I came away with a greater appreciation for this sport. HIGHLY recommended,1
"Very professional and great work. Gave me a fair quote, showed up on time, got the work done quickly, and the bill was exactly what was quoted. I'll be using Affordable Garage Door Service for any garage door needs I have in the future.",1
"I contacted a few carpet cleaning companies through Yelp for a quote for our large house to do carpet and tile cleaning. Anthony was the quickest to respond and had the best rates. He was very accommodating with scheduling a time on the weekend that worked for us. We originally were going to do the carpet and tile all in one day, but unfortunately we had to do them on different days because of some broken equipment  and couldn't be fixed on a Sunday. Anthony was quick to contact me and tell me of this issue. I had no problems with that, as I understand things can happen that are out of one person's control.Anthony showed up on time for our appointment. He was very friendly and got to work. He had our carpet done in no time and looking good as new! Everything dried pretty quickly and we were very pleased. We set up an appointment for the following weekend to have the tile done. A different Anthony showed up to do that work, but was just as friendly and explained the process and how long it would take. He actually finished ahead of the time he quoted me. We were very pleased with both Anthony's and the work they did. We will definitely use them again!",1
My favorite Ramen restaurant in Las Vegas! Small place but they manage everything well. I love Tonkatsu Ramen and Gyoza. And the service was good.,1
"OMG! I think this is the best Thai food place I have tried thus far. I must admit a yelper on here was right its in a hidden shopping center a creepy one, we went in the day thank goodness if not I would feel unsafe going at night. However, ONE MUST REALLY LOOK PAST THE PARKING LOT. As I entered the restaurant it looked like a hole in the wall your expecting this small shack, however you're greeted to a huge wall wine cases with wooden chairs and tables updated decor for a strip mall restaurant. It was very clean and the staff was very friendly. So we tried the Chicken coconut soup, the flavor was just amazing you pick a 1-10 spicy rating my hubby picked a 7 and he was burning his mouth, I don't like spicy and I even could not stop sipping and eating this that's how good it was that I ignored the fact it was to spicy for me cause every other flavor was simply amazing. The fried garlic shrimp prawns were to die for, the were amazing I am at a tie with Hot N Juice as to which one I would prefer. The garlic and spices with the crunchy breading makes it seem you're in food heaven. This is a place you must visit. Many renowned chefs have visited, if you're a food you will understand why it is a must. Just come I am sure you will not regret it.",1
This is probably my  favorite tea house in Las Vegas.  If you going to this palace. You must be try their matcha brûlée.  That taste feel like creme  brûlée. The cashier is so nice. And This pink background is perfect for girls to take pictures.,1
"Simply one of best Thai paces in town, hope they continue to keep there quality and service at same level, amazing crab salad and other delicious dishes,, good job!",1
"We come from a small city so any chance to feel ""star-struck"" is a pretty fun experience. We're Food Network fans and wanted to see how Jet Tila's restaurant would be live up to expectations.Located in the Wynn, at the end of The Strip, it was quite a walk for us [from the Linq] but it was a beautiful evening in Vegas.They don't take reservations but we waited only about 30 minutes. The dining room is very nice looking -the crystal dragon is gorgeous- though it opens directly into the casino and cigarette smoke wafted in - being from Oregon, none of us could get used to this. All of the service staff was wonderful: pleasant and mindful.Food choices were very tough. After much deliberation we settled on a dim sum appetizer, the Panang Curry, Nasi Goreng, and the Drunken Noodles. I wanted Ramen so bad but figured it to be tough to share. I recommend the Blue Lychee Cooler for a drink.",1
Been coming here since I was in my moms belly. Best authentic Mexican food I've had. Closest to my abuelitas. The food is amazing and the customer service is great! Love Pepe's!!,1
"I love love love The Birthday Suit! Stacie & Jason are awesome, and so are the rest of their staff. I've been coming here for the past year and a half, and it's great!  I feel really comfortable coming here. No awkwardness whatsoever. You can't have that when someone's all up in your nani! LoL!If you're like me, and tend to make last minute appointments, they can accommodate you.Totally recommend this place to everyone!",1
"Friendly and very helpful staff!  To Mr. Chris Peterson, thank you so very much for going the extra distance to provide the assistance we needed to take of the difficulties we experienced bringing our vehicles over from Germany. The professionalism and support we have been treated with will always have us coming back! Thank you!",1
"Raw Oysters on the half shell and the workers shelling it were able to tell me what type and kind they were. Tons of seafood lots of fresh food and LAMB! Hehehe. The best buffet ever in Vegas. Plus their macarons were to DIE for! They melted in your mouth with a subtle flavor then flooded you with a strong savory flavor that made me go ""Wow""! It's about 50 bucks a person but SOOOO worth it.",1
My recent experience here was amazing. The last time I was here was a little challenging so that's what I was expecting but I was proved wrong. From scheduling the exam to getting my glasses today it was easy and convenient. My glasses came in on time and fit perfectly. I didn't have to wait at all and I am very appreciative!,1
So thankful I found them.  I've been wearing orthotics for 30 years and my feet have NEVER been so happy.,1
"The owners were so nice and the pancakes we tried were totally delicious! They gave us samples of the cotton cake to try, which I had never heard of before. It was like a light, sweet cheesecake (gluten-free) - so good we bought one! We got to meet sweet Isabella. The only thing missing for me were some comfy couches and candles so I could lounge around for a while longer in this zen place on a cold day!",1
"This place has been my favorite restaurant since I was a kid. Absolutely love the manapuas, the island wings and pretty much everything else. I hope this place never closes. In the fact they need to expand more throughout the valley.",1
"I was very impressed with Dr. Sharma. He took his time and made sure to go over all of my concerns. He referred me to a great surgeon group here in town who did a wonderful job as well. He is a competent and compassionate doctor which is, in my opinion, very difficult to find. I called with a concern and he returned my call immediately and within the time frame that the receptionist had  expressed to me. He is attentive, knowledgeable, and I believe truly has his patients best interest at heart. I have referred multiple people to him. All of the feedback I have heard from them parallels what I have reflected in this review. Dr. Sharma thank you for your dedication to our community! The office is very big and very clean, some decor and furniture is outdated as noted in other reviews but let me ask you this, does that impact your healthcare? I know I certainly don't need a new modern fancy office to make sure my health is the first priority! The furniture isn't the doctor here, so to judge the quality of care on that is simply silly in my opinion. I have found my doctor to trust!",1
"Love this neighborhood spot!  Worn wood flooring, high ceilings, plenty of seating and an expanse of windows overlooking Monona Bay make this an inviting spot to snag a coffee and settle in. There are plenty of food options to accompany your beverage, if you're hungry during your visit. The entry portion of the building hosts seating and a bar, keep heading on towards the back to find the coffee house. Additional seating & a kids area can be found downstairs. Lots of outdoor seating on either a back deck or in a shaded front space. Plenty of options for everyone. Worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood.",1
"Great ambiance and cool friendly staff.  Have been to PublicUs for coffee on several occasions, and finally tried their food.  Everything tasted great!  Fresh ingredients and yummy baked goods.  My mom loved her steak dish and my croissant sandwich exceeded expectations.  Thank you for a great experience!",1
Had it for lunch today on Sahara location...will be having it for dinner tonight by the house on S 215 and Jones great food and price,1
Dr Wiltgen was very kind on my firs visit today. Gentle and effective. I'm returning next week and am sure he will be a great help for my back problems. A good chiropractic experience.,1
"It makes me feel good to know that I can trust my baby's care to an awesome staff! My toy Maltese has received 2 surgeries and several check-ups and we have always received excellent, professional care. The staff really cares about your best friend. Thanks again!",1
Went in for dinner tonight and got the Bleu Brisket Saled... I'm mean come on the grilled chicken salad is the bomb so I don't even know what to call Bleu Brisket salad but even better!!! I added craisins to it with the balsamic dressing and oh my gosh. Ryan was in the kitchen tonight and made it RIGHT YO!!!... And our waitress CATHY who we've only had 1 time before remembered exactly what we got the one time before. Now that's good customer service. Give them a raise Michael L.  Lol...,1
"As much as I didn't enjoy my experience with this location, the customer service through the chain is great---I noticed the beetles as an extraneous thing, but the company owner got back to me very quickly on Yelp and said they sprayed for pests to fix that issue. The owner ALSO got back to me and said I could go to a location near me to get my button fixed and I received a call quickly. Also, someone from this location followed up with a phone call after my original review, but unfortunately I am not near that location to try them again. Either way---I was contacted by someone from a closer location and got my button fixed without an appointment in like 15 minutes. Super easy. Thanks for the good customer service. I still like this auto chain and will continue to go:)",1
Omg this place is bomb. I had the pancakes n trust me IHOP has nothing on babystacks. You definitely need to come try this place. You will be glad you did.,1
"Nestled in a strip mall next to Bi-Lo grocery store off Hwy 51 and I-485. My first time eating Indian food - man, was it good! I went with coworkers who were more seasoned, so they steered me towards Chicken Korma (chicken in a spiced cream sauce over rice). We also sampled Mendu Vada (lentil doughnuts) and Gobi Paratha (paratha bread stuffed with spiced cauliflower). Everything was delicious. The service was fast and friendly. I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back and try something new!",1
"My daughter loves it here!  The staff is great and super friendly!  I can't say enough about this school.  The teachers are wonderful and the office staff is great too!  They do extra activities for the kids like Santa Pictures, Pony rides/pictures, Smokey the Bear even came!  Pizza Fridays are always fun, and it seems like every parent there appreciates what they do and it shows.  When you're paying good money for your child to go to preschool, you expect top-notch and that's what you get.  No parents letting wild and crazy kids run around in parking lot, tantrums, etc.  Not saying public school kids or parents are all bad, but I live by a public elementary school and I can see the difference between the way the parents handle their children and it shows in the child's actions as well.Thank you Seton for being worth every penny.  If only they could keep my daughter all the way through High School..",1
"Best Pizza and Italian Style Restaurant in Indian Trail, NC. They have a full menu of Italian Home Style Cooking and desserts.",1
Came by to get the car washed. They did a really good job. I have dogs and they got all of their out.,1
"Gangnam by far is the best Korean BBQ I have ever had!  I have been to many kbq restaurants in Vegas and LA even in ktown! Gangnam is on a league of its own!  The food is top quality flavored and I spent less than what I would spend on an ayce place.  I liked the beef toro, Korean prime rib, and the egg was awesome!  Most of all the service is awesome specifically from our server named Rina",1
"This was probably the best club space in town, and if you've been to most of the ""hot spots"" you'll know what I'm talking about. This place is huge, not to mention that it extends out into the pool area, so everyone's not walking on top of each other like TAO *cringe* The music was amazing the DJs were on point, I especially liked the streamers/confetti that were tied into the music, I know they do this at all of the club spaces, but I felt it tied in better here.I didn't have any issues with the line because I stayed at Encore and got complementary VIP tickets, so I was able to wave goodbye to everyone who waited in the general line which is a huge plus!My only complaint is the smell, which seems to be stronger in some areas than others, its really bad and after reading the reviews it seems I'm not the only one who notices it. But over all this is my new favorite, I plan on going here next time I visit!",1
Had the New York Rueben. It was pretty good just a bit tough. The sweet potato fries where great.  The atmosphere was great. The sever was real sweet. All in all it was great place.,1
"The best Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas. The pasta is so fresh and authentic, but don't limit yourself, there is nothing on the menu you won't enjoy.Great new happy hour from 5-7 where you get three portions for $18, what a steal! Go with the chicken meatballs, they are great but the tomato-gorgonzola fonduta is spectacular.",1
Great pizza!!!  I ordered it for delivery. They were on time and the pizza was very good. It was a realy homemade pizza. Thank you Napoli. My family and I will order it again.,1
I can't speak to quality of the rooms because I've never stayed at this hotel. What I do love about NyNy is the $5 blackjack and roulette tables! So hard to find on the strip. Always a little crowded but once you get a seat it's so worth it! Also on Sunday they offered a free lesson on how to play Craps. It was awesome!! I've always wanted to learn to play and finally was able to. The guy who gave the lesson was from the northeast and he was really great!,1
"As far as a hookah lounge go is was very pleasant. The food could use improvement but I'm assuming they only really have a fryer in the back. They had board games and TVs which set them apart from other lounges. The assortment of flavors was very large. The one thing missing, an alcohol license. Other than that I had a very pleasant time there and hope to return someday.",1
"Terrific service!  I use this service every year to shred files and such that are outdated.  These documents contain sensitive material and it is always handled with care and disposed of properly.  The staff is very professional, friendly, and helpful and the process is smooth.  I will continue to use their service in the future.",1
"My husband and I went into Citrus Massage for the first time today, and LET ME TELL YOU . . . This is the most gorgeous spa I have ever seen! Nothing like the cliche dark Tuscan spas. It's beautiful and clean and the colors are light and airy. It smells unbelievably delicious from the essential oils diffusing. (I'm a big oils user so I personally loved this detail!) Citrus water and sweets on the table, no detail missed. The front staff was warm and welcoming. The massage therapists are top of the line. My husband is incredibly picky about massage therapists, and since moving here to AZ he hasn't found a single one he likes (he's tried a dozen no joke) and he said Ethelyn was the best he's ever had. (So glad he found someone he can go back to consistently!) I had Sidney and she is great for deep tissue! Also however long you booked your massage time for, you get that time HANDS ON. So my 60 minute massage was a full 60 minute hands on massage unlike my other spa that counts dress and prep time into that, leaving me only 45 min. The price is one of the most affordable in the valley so our membership is doable which is great because I get migraines and need consistent massages to ease them up a bit. So grateful to find a place close to us that we both love. You will not be disappointed! Seriously I'm so happy this place just opened.",1
I wanted to have my home entertainment looked at and have my 75in tv moved from one wall to another.  Jarrod quoted me half the price I received from a precious company.  Jarrod and his crew were extremely friendly and honest.  He explained to me what I need and didnt need to maximize my home entertainment.  I highly recommend them to anybody looking for good quality service at a reasonable price.,1
"This really was a lovely little lounge. It was exactly what we were looking for amongst the chaos, glitz, and over stimulation of Las Vegas. It was a bit quieter with a very classy overall vibe. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. Each drink was carefully thought out and constructed. Everything was delicious, including the complimentary truffle popcorn.  This really was the perfect place to get away from the club-like atmosphere that surrounds it. We were able to sit in comfortable arm chairs, sip tasty cocktails, and have a conversation with ease and no straining to yell over obnoxious music. Highly recommend!I only wished we had stopped in at tea time. Perhaps next time...",1
Great service and great food.  Highly recommend going here before or after a baseball game.,1
"First time we visited here we ordered large pepperoni pizza and ziti pasta , it was awesome!! The cheese is soo good .",1
"Great employment agency! Friendly and helpful staff. They get a good selection of jobs and are very loyal to their workers. You won't just be a number, you'll be treated like an individual!",1
"Amazing staff! Hakon is awesome, you can tell he takes pride In what he does! Food is always perfect. I can not complain about anything.",1
I love the brunch here. Great drinks and food. Plus the bartenders are super cool. Good times! Will be back again.,1
"Great, reliable place to get my dried herbs and extras. Great pricing, knowledge, lovely staff. I always come here to replenish my herbal remedy kit. Even hard to find herbs and the like can be bought by the ounce. They even sell some of their own smoking, tea and remedy blends.I have never had a consultation with them here, but they will be the first place I go if I need something.",1
"I love this shop so much that I had to add extra shelves for spices in my kitchen!There are so few places to find good quality spices, and the prices are great.  They have many hard to find spices and some great spice blends.Some of my favourite things to pick up are:- Vietnamese Saigon Cassia Cinnamon - the best cinnamon that I have ever tasted- West-African Citrus Spice - which is a surprisingly delicious addition to many dishes (and popcorn)- Aji Amarillo - which I use in place of cayenne in most recipes these daysThey are always very helpful as well.  If you want a jar of something that isn't available, or a refill bag of something (spices are even cheaper that way), they will happily get it for you right away.",1
Do yourself a favor and get the PB&J bacon buger. Absolutely delicious and they don't skimp on the PB&J (there is plenty for dipping). Happy Hour prices were pretty good too. Definitely a good place to kick back with friends and some drinks and enjoy Rehab's fun food and atmosphere.,1
"Tracy is the best! My acrylic nails always look amazing, and my nails are never damaged or weak! She is very meticulous in her work. The spa itself is immaculately clean and gorgeous! Everyone there is friendly and skilled. The ONLY place to go for nails in AZ!!",1
We found this place from a local. What an amazing find. I had a great caesar salad with grilled chicken and very fresh romain. My husband got a shredded duck sandwich and fries. My salad was awesome and my husband loved his sandwich.We never would have found this place on yelp on our own. Yummy!,1
"Fantastic customer service! Called Rob out to install a pressure regulator valve as part of the home inspection for selling the house. He gave me an accurate, up front estimate and showed up right on time. Turns out, my set up was extremely unique and Rob was honest about what the new cost would be. I ended up passing on the repair, but Rob's visit was free and he even fixed part of my water heater while he was out there. Great guy and would recommend him based on his integrity and customer service.",1
I had a great experience going in for an upgrade. Steven helped me set up my new phone and open another line. Overall the experience was smooth and easy and I'm happy with my new phone. Steven is an asset at this store and I would recommend anyone to go get their phone services taken care of by him.,1
"I went for a girls night out with a coworker and I had a blast! It's great because you can bring your own bottle of wine. I think that helped the creativity flow and add ""personality"" to my painting. I highly recommend Brush Party to anyone who wants to unwind and get creative. No prior painting experience necessary, just a good attitude. The location is good too, right off central, you could drink and take the light rail home. I must say Anthony (our instructor) was awesome and he had lots of funny jokes to keep us engaged. He is following his passion and you can tell by his enthusiasm for the business. Keep up the good work, would definitely come back!",1
"Can't say enough good things about having your kids birthday party here! My 1 year old had a blast, the pricing was amazing for the service and experience you get. I highly recommend!",1
"High noon, hot sun, La Piazza al Forno is a welcome shady rest in old town Glendale. The staff works well together and our server Patti welcomed us like old friends. She showed a genuine enthusiasm and true joy that is often lost in most restaurants.My lunch special was a hybrid pizza/calzone that was perfectly baked and came piping hot with the best crust in town and freshest basil I've tasted. I make great pizza but I can't compete with their knowledge and the beautiful imported oven that is the namesake of their restaurant. Five star flavor in a tin star town.",1
This tour was amazing. So many amazing food selections. My husband and I had many foods we normally would not have ordered but discovered we really loved. Our tour guide Whitney was fabulous. On the tour we visited RetroSpecs and were able to try on eyeglasses that were owned by celebrities. This is a great way to go to high end restaurants and enjoy top notch food and drinks!  We will do it again!  I also recommend the helicopter ride over the strip as part of the package!!!  Our pilot was Eddie and he was so wonderful. I could go on and on!,1
"Saturday brunch was great.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, the pad Thai was great, and the prime rib was good too.  The best part was our server, Louise.  She's definitely an asset.  Oh, and the free Champagne was good too.",1
"Not for the price-sensitive person. By far, the best gym in Vegas. Friendly staff and great atmosphere.",1
"My wife and I celebrated my birthday weekend in Vegas and it was capped with a great show in Absinthe.  Great humor, extremely talented acts and great theatrics.  I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the program.  I highly recommend this for date night for adults.  Strong funny language...",1
"Called Gianni and he immediately called me right back. I live out of state but I have rental property in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. I hired DiFranco Contractors to manage a remodel I had going. Easiest experience I've ever had. Thanks DiFranco Contractors. I am definitely buying more rentals in Ohio.",1
Had a wonderful pedicure and Brazilian wax here. The entire experience was relaxing and enjoyable. They even have shuttle service for those staying on the strip. They pick you up and drop you off!,1
"My family & I went to Brickhouse this weekend, and I'm usually not one to review, but our server, Justin, was just too amazing not to. He was kind, diligent, and thoughtful of each and every one of us (5). He genuinely cared about our dining experience and that is so hard to find nowadays! Furthermore, every single one of us loved our meals. The atmosphere was lovely, and we all had an excellent time. Thanks again Justin!",1
"Delicious as usual ! The mussels were amazing as was the banana roll and dragon roll . I love the Lisa Lisa and Yum Yum roll and the scallops. Service a little slow at the end and we couldn't stick around for tempura green tea ice cream  , but that's okay , I still love it here",1
"Amazing burger and even better fries! Not a fan of the the wait time for a table or to get the food, though so don't show up too hungry.This restaurant is inside Planet Hollywood with a cool display out front, what I refer to as the ""tiny fire rollercoaster.""I got the Hell's Kitchen burger with the gooey fries. The gooey fries had cheese, salami, egg and creme fraiche - life changing! Burger was cooked to perfection, as expected from a Ramsey restaurant, and so flavorful without being too spicy.I was able to make it through half the burger and fries, and they were both delicious the next morning without being heated up.Server was great, atmosphere was laid back and the prices are very reasonable for Vegas. I'd recommend you bump this to the top of your burger restaurant list in Vegas (and there a plenty of burger restaurants!).",1
"Great music, friendly staff, nice place to catch the sunset and people watch. Located in the same parking lot as Gold & Silver Pawn. Lots of free parking. Walking distance to Downtown.",1
"I flew in to Charlotte for a job interview, and my wife and I came here for dinner. It was fantastic. The restaurant itself is in a historic home, and we loved the decor and the atmosphere. I ordered the grilled hangar steak, which came perfectly cooked. The horseradish sauce, potato cake, and fresh green beans were all delicious. I will definitely come back next time I'm in town, and I would definitely order the hangar steak again.",1
"I love this food! A mix of all my favorite Asian dishes from japan, China, and Vietnam dishes. The sushi is superb!",1
I have to say that if your ever in Vegas this place is a must try for all the pizza lovers in the world .,1
"Who loves to move??? Not me :-( the best thing about moving was Nate, Will and Anthony. From the beginning, everything was handled professionally. Prior to my move date, I was contacted to confirm everything. The actual day of my move, Will called and gave an estimated time of arrival. The communication was GREAT!!! It really helped since I had a million other things to worry about - confirming the appointment slipped my mind. The guys carefully wrapped everything, including the entryway of my door, stairwell and my furniture. This put me at ease!!! We all know how careless people can be, right!!??? I mean, it's not their furniture... these guys treated my property like it was theirs. It was much appreciated, after dealing with family members and friends tearing up my furniture. Furthermore, not even knowing something is damaged until use use it...etc. these guys didn't damage one single thing. Listen, stop comparing other companies, don't be cheap!!! Pay and hire Five Star Moving!!!!!!They made my move less stressful ;-)",1
Amazing ramen place! Kind of hidden off Fremont! I had the black garlic ramen and it was amazing!,1
"This is my boyfriend's favorite Peppi's location and I can see why. The staff are INCREDIBLY friendly. The food is always delicious, because it's Peppi's after all! The New York Steak is his favorite and I usually try something different every time I visit. The bread is always fresh and soft and the hoagies are always just packed with flavor. Yum!",1
"I got an 8 week old puppy and Town Center was recomended. They have a ""puppy package"" that you can .get for a set price that covers all shots and exams.. I shopped around for the best price on getting my dog(Roxy) spade. They had the best price i could find. So i was happy because it's such a nice, clean, and new place. They can even do it laproscopically for an extra 100 bucks(tiny incision and only 1 day recovery time). A year later my dog ate a tennis ball, so i called around and again they had the best price to surgically remove it! Thanks doctor Burghardt!  The 24 hour emergency service is a lifesaver too. All four of the doctors there are very professional, kind and patient, BUT, my favorite is DR Jill Cordeiro..now I ask for her every time..She is Awsome! wish i would have yelped this place sooner to share what a great place this is with all the high tech equipment, smart young doctors, and prices that cant be beat...KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK TOWN CENTER! ! !  would definatelly recommend:)",1
One of the cleanest strip clubs in Las Vegas. The girls are awesome and the staff in general are on point and very accommodating. I will be coming back!!!!!! If you're in town I suggest you check them out.,1
"This was our first time at a Five Guys.  The gentleman that took.our order explained the menu to us and was very nice.  We each ordered a cheeseburger andy husband ordered a small fries yo split.  Before our order was up, a cook called over and said they had an extra patty.  We were welcome to add it to one of our singles free of charge.  When we got our order shortly after that we also noticed that our small fries was HUGE!  I highly recommend this establishment if you like burgers.  Additionally, I noticed the cooks wear rubber gloves!  An added plus for me, being OCD!",1
"This is the only pizza I eat now. No others compare!!  We love the pesto pizza with both sausages, spinach and capers! A little crispy..cooked to perfection. YUMMY!!! The employees are awesome-fun, friendly and always smiling! I've been coming since they opened. You'll love it! The place was packed today!!",1
best time being high in the sky...offical high rollers..beautiful scene..especially watching the Bellagio water show from the top,1
"Today I decided to visit this place for the first time. Got the plain hot dog & a poutine, and it was quite delicious and tastier than I expected, and Also came with a good serving of food to go with it. This is the only location I've seen where Coca Cola comes in a glass bottle. (I'm pretty sure there maybe others too). Whenever I'm in the area again, I'll definitely revisit.",1
"I love this place, it's not expensive and the food is fast and amazing! My favorite is the quinoa avocado bowl with grilled chicken! Also the Guac is amazing, get a large bowl and the chips are free. They have some really good craft beers as well!",1
"Lets just say portions are fabulous, service is superb and the setting is very country. I love it here! You have 3 choices of BBQ sauce, all homemade. I can't say enough good things about this place! I'm from Chicago and this is for sure a go to place!!!",1
"There is a burgeoning food scene outside the strip where the prices are way more reasonable and the quality is greater. This new place is a perfect example. The pork belly is an amazing deal for $17 (you get 2 steaks which could feed two ppl). Homemade salsa with a good tequila selection. The staff is incredibly nice and makes the experience all about you. The location doesn't seem great, but looks are deceiving. Give this place a shot. You won't regret it.",1
"Have you ever been so parched in the Vegas desert that you something to refresh you? Have you ever dreamed for a sweet cold drink to savor? Are you a health nut and want something organic and fruity? Look no further. This is the place for you! Plenty of fruit juices, all made 100% fresh, free sampling, and reasonable pricing all make for a delightful experience. My pick personally is the raspberry or blueberry mojito. After all, mint makes everything more refreshing. The taste of coolness and freshness just combined in a way I've never experienced. I'd advise to check this place out. It is truly worth it.",1
"Love the options for healthy dining. Good variety for everyone whether you are a meat eater or vegan. Ingredients are fresh and always made to order. My favorites are the ALl the Wraps, Pro Waffle Towers, Açaí Bowls, and Cobb Salad.",1
"I did a spa'rty here last weekend for my cousins bachelorette and it was amazing. The package is $20 off a 60 minute treatment and a choice of a menu item. Denise helped me set this up for 7 girls and she did a wonderful job. It's challenging organizing a large group and she was very responsive, accommodating and helpful. The spa is very nice and clean. I really enjoyed the steam and sauna and hot pool inside. Outdoors is the waterfall one that's co-ed and you take the stairs up to the pool. The chairs are limited so we sat along the pool until someone left which wasn't too long of a wait. There are awesome bean bag type chairs in the pool so you can sit on one and float along the water. The service was great. The drinks were lovely. We had lunch upstairs inside with a beautifully lit room. Complimentary coffee and mixed nuts. They had a cute sign with our group name and everyone got a water bottle to take home. You also received 20% off any purchase made at the store! I did a lot of research on my spas for this and I'm really happy I picked this one. It's a little pricey but it's well worth it. My massage was amazing and professional. You really feel relaxed and happy after visiting here.  I would highly recommend it! Everyone loved it!",1
"1 word says it all.... Yummy,Yummy,Yummy.Yep one word. I've never been disappointed and I'm a little picky plenty of variety to choose from Seating is limited but I don't need to sit down to eat a lemon blueberry muffin",1
"Love this place! Pricy, but awesome options when you are trying to eat healthy but have something aside from a salad with chicken. Go for breakfast and get the protein pancakes!",1
I purchased a gift certificate for my boyfriend for window tinting Service. Scheduling our appointment was a breeze and everything happened within the time line that we were quoted. I would recommend this guy to anyone.,1
"Rene was a light at the end of a tunnel. She stayed open late for me to rent a storage unit. She was polite, knowledgeable and very professional, selling me exactly what I needed and not trying to upswell me. I definitely recommend renting from her.",1
Love this place food is always fresh. Good clean atmosphere.. friendly staff. If you like salad you will love this place!! Good alternative to fast food!!,1
"I'm a fan.I stopped for some fun gazing at the weekend farmer's market and decided to stay for lunch.  Had a great burger, half pound for $8.45, friendly staff was busy with lunch time crowd but still kept my soda full.  Nice Old West atmosphere.The table next to me ordered the wings and I could smell them as the server brought them past me.  I'm normally not a fan, but these were exceptionally great smelling and my hound dog nose was aroused.  I asked the orderers and they confirmed they are the best on the valley.BTW, despite the name, they unfortunately no longer sell steaks for lunch or dinner (I asked).",1
My best friend was married over the weekend.  Rose Garden provided the flowers and they were gorgeous.  The succulents and flowers in our bouquets were beautiful and the table flowers were perfect as well.  Thank you so much!,1
"Lived in this area over 20 years ago & Top Shelf was our place for Mexican food.  For awhile the quality dropped, we moved & stopped visiting.  Recently we decided to give it a try, made the drive & we were pleasantly surprised.   Nice patio was added.  We sat at the bar, had a drink & dinner.  The food was great!  Service was fantastic.   All the staff would stop & check on you.  Even though they were crazy busy drinks & food were served fast.  Our bill was very reasonable.  We were so happy with our ""first"" visit back, we've been back 3 times!  Always busy but not lacking in quality food & service.  Thank you.",1
Amazing service and cute cafe in a rather desolate strip of Corktown. Simple menu and  even espresso focused.,1
Love this heathy new edition to the neighborhood. So many variations of salads and bowls and great ingredients and delicious drinks too,1
Yummy spot in Montreal for all day brunch! Very much enjoy the Apple cinnamon caramel crate Caramell latte was a little bit better but edit four packs of sugar in it it was OK! Also had a chance to try the small waffle it was amazing! What definitely come back here on a return visit,1
Very helpful staff. Great vape juice selection!!! Thanks Azara!!! Also awesome heady glass section,1
If you love Sushi. This place i highly recommend.  Service are awsome. Food are sooo good i would come again and again..,1
"I'm super happy they opened this location it's closer to my house! Amazing experience the owner was in and helped us out he was very helpful as always! Great environment friendly staff! They're super busy at this location but very quick for how many customers they had! I recommend apple, watermelon, & blue raspberry",1
"I scheduled my appt 3 month in advance with Joe. (He is the guy that was on the tv show Ink Master Angels and did that amazing geometric piece on my husband's leg!) The other artists Chris and Heather were cranking out some awesome pieces as well!So anyway, I sent pics of what I had in mind to cover up a 21 year old tattoo and he created the most beautiful piece that I could have imagined. He listened to what I wanted and the meaning behind it and gave me a great cover up. We had a good conversation over the 4 hours I was there about family, work, growing up and music. All around a nice guy. My husband and I will both be back for more ink. I'll also add that it is a 4 hour drive and hotel stay for us to go to Verona and worth every cent. He even made our daughter feel at home with applying her temp tattoos.",1
"This place is a cool spot if you are looking for a twist on a burger! Bao burgers are the best! Now this is my second time here. The first time they didn't quite have a yelp page set up yet. And I took those for a work lunch, so no pics of the pork belly bao or the KFC bao., which were delicious. I couldn't choose a favorite between the two because they were so good. The chicken was crispy. The pork belly was a bite full of delight. This time around I got the longsilog and the BTS. The longsilog was my favorite of the 2. Papaya salad and the fried egg made this burger an elevated experience in my mouth. The burger itself was also a little textured but in a good way. The BTS was also delicious but the sauce was a little sweet for me. I upgraded to a combo this time. I will agree with other posts that the fries were not my favorite. It had a crust kind of like the Arby's curly fries has. They are stating to do a bao of the week. So the flavor combinations are endless here. Can't wait to go again!",1
"I love gastro pubs. There's nothing more comfortable or satisfying for me than a gastro pub. Dark enough to be romantic yet hipster enough to be trendy.Miscellaneous 4/5It was rather inconvenient to get to Black Hoof, but the street cars on Dundas, Barthust and Christie make it much easier for folks with no cars. The menu is hipster enough to be on the board. So you might want glasses to see what's available! Food 5/5So good and creative. Here are some items we tried. Ice cider - very sweet and tasty. Just how I like it. Not as bubbly nor bitter as a hard cider. Aged manhattan - didn't taste the tawny port in there. It was a little too much bourbon/whiskey in my opinion but my boyfriend liked it!House made bread - nice herbs but with no butter or olive oil, I found it a little plain to eat 3-4 pieces at a go (small portion). Don't think I would try it again..Bone marrow with salt - so simple and so good! The bone marrow just shone with the awesome grilled bread!! I liked the none marrow with chimichurri but salt was also available. Pork carnitas tacos - so good!! Love the little crispness on the outer part of the pork. It was tender and tasty. And the guacamole was great!! The lime also brought out great flavor from the pork. I didn't try the spicy sauce but I loved the little container it was held in!!Foie berry shortcake - I cannot believe this is a dessert. Unbelievable. It is so rich and intense but yet tastes so right. It was 25CAN but its well worth the cost. And it was just nice to be shared with two or three other adventurous folks. Service 3/5Servers were a little slow for my liking. There was quite a bit of waiting in between orders. And you need to be armed with cash :/ with no ATMs in store. Black hoof is really tiny, so it's not meant for big parties. And if you don't wanna make reservations you should probably go late or really early ;)",1
"Great service for fixing my drain. He gave me a great quote, responded quickly & was here the next day. Very friendly & efficient with his services. Would highly recommend him",1
Went here today with my daughter and WOW!! Their smoothie are larger than most places and the flavor for all 4 of our smoothies were very pleasing to the palette. . Being a former chef and tasted volcano tea or now café. .also Kung fu tea house and this place has them beat with flavor.  Their Boba cooked perfect and definitely will come back!! They also serve food . Can't wait to try it..very nice setting too. Possible father's day dining this weekend...,1
They have a buffet at lunch time for those who are eating Indian food for the first time. They have about 6 dishes to try from.For dinner I had butter chicken and Jafrezi (cheese) and both were a hit.Will be back,1
"I have been to quite a few magic/mind reading shows in Las Vegas since I am a Vegas resident. I thought this show was better than some other lon running magic shows on the strip. In the beginning, Jen sounded and looked  like a bit awkward but I thought it was part of her charm and makes her relatable. I have seen magicians doing the same shows for a long time, and their delivery was smooth and practiced, but they were just going through the motion. I thought she was breath of fresh air.As the show went on, she warmed up and things started to roll smoothly. There was a group of bachelor party in attendance, and the volunteers from that group was having lots of fun. Jen said she was flattered that a bachelor party choose to attend her 6pm family friendly show.She made sure the kids in the audience were part of the participation, and the families were having good fun. I know the kids were mesmerized and followed the each acts. I didn't see any kids getting bored and losing focus.We like to take apart the magic acts and figure out how they are done. Some acts were easy to figure out (like calculator one), but some acts, we had no idea (type of drink). I hope her show stays for a long run. I think she deserve that.I think Westgate is great venue for her show. Comparable shows on the strip costs at least double to be in a fancier location. At Westgate, a whole family can enjoy her show without breaking a bank. I like the show room setting like a stadium seating with a slope. The far seats get to be higher and can see things without being obstructed by someone tall in front of you.",1
This place is so good! My boyfriend brought it home for dinner one night and wow! We got a cheese pizza and a meat lovers of some sort and I've never once actually enjoyed a cheese pizza before Spinato's!  Also their home made sauce is sort of sweet  which I really enjoyed. When went back again on another occasion and they were all very friendly and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting. This place has definitely become a date night go to for my boyfriend and I!,1
Holy smokes!This is one of the best programs I've seen out of a commercial brand name gym. It's got all the amenities of a big gym with the family care and service of a box gym.The workouts! Oh man...the workouts are killer but only as hard as I'm able to work. One thing I noticed is that the person next to me just wasn't in the best shape but the trainers worked with them to give them the attention they needed to get a tough workout but not something that was going to leave them sore for the next week.If you are new to fitness or really want to dial up your results check these guys out.,1
Boutique is the word here.  The interior has an industrial sheik with local prints on the wall that you can buy for a mere $250.  The lighting above the cash desk is recycled high bay covers (warehouse lighting) with some paint on the inside.  The burgers are big (6 oz) and will run you $6 to $9.  I had the Craft Burger which was uber delish.  I'm really diggin' the garlic mayo they slathered on this beast.  For an extra $3.20 you can make it a combo with fries or onion rings and a can of Coke.  I was a little disappointed at the small portion of the onion rings but they were tasty.For $10 it was well worth the money.,1
"Sarah does an exceptional job both with microblading brows and also with training.  I work in the same building as Sarah and have watched hundreds of perfect pairs of brows leave her studio. I have seen with my own eyes Sarahs skill over a 6 month period of time.  I have talked to many of her first time and return clients.  I have not heard a single complaint about her work.  I decided to try it.  My brows are pretty full but are missing the ends;)  I wanted to have it done on myself before I signed my mom up to make sure I knew what I was getting her into.  Sarah did them today and they look great.  I am so excited to get my mom in so she doesnt have to pencil on her brows every morning.  Sarah is fast and professional and down to earth. Her suite is clean, beautiful and the process was comfortable, all in all I would give her more stars if I could.  Thanks Sarah!!!!!",1
"Had dinner here last night and was very impressed.  First the food: had the green chili beef burrito and was very impressed.  Next time looking forward to trying the chili relleno.  Next the service: very attentive staff, not only our waitress but the entire service team checked in on us throughout our meal.  Very courteous.  Finally, the atmosphere: this is a very unique setting with indoor seating, patio seating, and a pond the restaurant is built around where the kids can feed the ducks and swans.  Very well laid out and thoroughly enjoyable.  Can't wait to get back for more!",1
AJ was AMAZING!!  Dialed into the flavors we loved right away!! He was so helpful...funny and sweet!!  Will DEFINITELY be back!!,1
"Oh wow, those banana nut muffins are a piece of heaven. I first tried the Egg & I last year when I came to Vegas. I don't know what they put in their food but I always come back for more. Their omelettes are beautiful, thick, and not to mention VERY tasty. This past visit, I had the Fiesta skillet. I can't say it was better than the veggie omelette though. I personally like my potatoes very crispy and I didn't think of the fact that the potatoes that come in the skillet are in a sauce so they inevitably lost some of their crispness. Now I know to just order the sauce on the side because nothing beats the flavor in each of their meals.The atmosphere resembles that of a true American diner. The service is great. I've never had to wait for a seat and I have gone on weekends every time. Eat here!",1
"Best Thai food I have had in Vegas.  Tom yum gai soup has layers of flavor.  They delivery and so far have never had any issues, brought me a free Thai because they felt it took to long, even though I had no complaints.   My go to dish at any Thai place is the basil chicken dish, chicken is ground not chopped which allows the meat to soak up more flavor of the delicious spicy savory sauce.  The dinning room is very tiny maybe room for 15 people, so I think they survive on delivery and take out.  Prices are very reasonable service has always been great,  However if your looking for alcohol they do not offer any.  Other than than that one thing, I would still say just going by food they execute the curry and other dishes very well, BTW I have visited Thailand on several occasions if you want to add in those two cents.",1
"Fast and Courteous service was complimented by the mouth watering  wings and homemade onion rings. Their motto says it all ""small place, big taste"" or something along those lines. I will be going back for more. Prices are fair, the staff is down to earth and inviting, and the owner made us feel welcome by turning the fryers back on after the kitchen already closed.  Plenty of amazing micro brews to choose from at a good price point.  Great things can come in small packages, and grillers pub is a prime example.",1
VERY helpful in writing my emotional support letter for my sweet Sadie girl. Now she's being service trained but they were there when I needed them that's for sure.,1
"I've been a resident here for three months and couldn't love it more. The maintenance staff is always incredibly quick to help with any fixes that are needed and they know their stuff. The best part, though, is the staff in the leasing office. All four women are absolutely amazing at their jobs, are always willing to help with whatever and couldn't be nicer. A few weeks ago, I had to request they make a copy of my key, which couldn't have been a better/funnier experience. After a couple minutes of hilarious conversation between them, all three women in the leasing office end up huddled around the key-making machine in the back to help get the job done. As I walk up to see how things are going, one of them has goggles on for safety, with the other two there for moral support. The key ended up being perfect, just like they have been so far since I moved in. Thank you, Avana leasing/maintenance staff, for being nothing but supportive so far!",1
"I called Ray based on Chris and Brett's reviews. Ray is the real deal - very honest and affordable. I needed an alignment, an oil change, and I was also smelling a burning smell coming from outside the car on the right side. Ray said that Hondas don't need realignments; my tires were low and him filling them up stopped the veering to the right. I had thought the burning smell might be an oil leak, but Ray found a plastic bag had melted onto the underside of my car near the exhaust pipe. He scraped it off with a grinder and also did the oil change. No more burning smell. He had my car for roughly 5 hours. Total bill: $74.Highly recommended!",1
Love this place !! Lacy is my favorite ! She is hilarious and everyone enjoyed the great atmosphere.This place is very welcoming! Make an appointment!!!,1
"We had Fabulous Food cater a wedding reception, and are so thankful for all the expertise, guidance and outstanding level of service they delivered.  Everyone we dealt with at Fabulous Food is at the top of their field at what they do.  They set up all the indoor and outdoor spaces in such a way to make the most of each area, given the size of our party.  Every menu item was perfectly executed and presented, and their staff bent over backwards for us and our guests to meet their every need (I say ""bent over"" in the figurative sense, but think they might have literally if someone had asked!).  The Sales Consultant and Chef perfectly guided me to keep things on track so I could focus on guests and even enjoy the party myself - they are masters.  They understood from the beginning what our vision was, and always had my back to make sure that vision was delivered regardless of job title. Throughout the night our guests would approach us to compliment all the great food and the event.  I could give them no greater compliment than to say that they made us look good!",1
"Great service from beginning to end.  Starting with speaking with Tracy.  Very knowledgeable.  I called on Saturday and I got an appointment for Monday between 1 and 4 pm.  On Monday, the installer, Allen, called around noonish and said he'd be at the house in 20 minutes.  He replaced my front windshield in great time and did great work.  I like that the guarantee includes future cracks on my new windshield for as long as I own my car.  Hi I am so glad I found them and would definitely recommend them to friends.",1
I was introduced to King Tapes through Groupon and was very pleased with my experience.  I took the tapes in around December of 2012 when they were quite busy nevertheless they were able to return the DVD's to me before the projected date.  My experience was quite positive all the way around.  I would definitely recommend them without hesitation which and I would gladly use them again.,1
"Thank you ""Big O"" for taking care of me weeks prior. The patchwork for my tire obviously is top notch. I discovered that my tire had a pretty sizable bolt right through the center on the tread. I had just pulled into my driveway after attending a funeral to support two little girls that had just lost their dad. It was raining, later on in the day and this was the last thing I wanted to deal with, considering. I called and was invited to come to this particular shop to see what could be done. They took care of me within MINUTES. Because of the nature of the damage, Jeremy and crew said there wouldn't be a charge. I was able to get back to my family and on the road safely. There isn't much more you could ask for in terms of service. Thanks again guys.",1
Amazing food everything was tasty been traveling and trying pho in every city and this has by far been one of our favorite,1
"I love this salon! I come here for eyebrow waxing, manicures, pedicures, up-dos, cutting, color - really anything. The atmosphere is so friendly and welcoming!  The staff know what they are doing and have all their various certifications posted along one of the walls - really cool looking! The ""team"" they have there, as they call it, are very cheery and always helpful in trying to accommodate my last minute needs ... sorry!  They are all very talented and I have yet to have a bad experience with my hair.",1
"Barb at Tees and More does a great job.  They provided our company shirts and did a perfect job.  Fast service, great service and great people.",1
"Felt like I was back home at the Lafayette Coney Island - and that to me is heaven.  I ordered ""2 on 1, lite onions"" and we were speaking the same language.  The fries were good.  My husband had the combo with the loose meat hamburger and loved it.  With Faygo POP, not soda, and Better Made chips, how can you go wrong?  If you are from Michigan especially, you will love it.",1
Hands down the best Al Pastor in the valley. Friendly staff and great attitude all the way around. You really feel like you're at someone's home and they are preparing you a dinner. 10 out of ten would recommend.,1
Slushy booze. Need I say anything else?Hint--bring your expensive mug from your last visit for a cheaper 'refill.',1
Food is the bombest shit ever! The waitress was on point too! Quite authentic and very true to the vegan lifestyle. I would recommend the enchiladas and the vegan ice cream. Thank you for such a blessed experience!,1
"What a great place!  Friendly staff, clean and nicely decorated interior. It is also very spacious so you aren't sitting an inch from your neighbor.  Lee, my nail technician, was a delight and she did an amazing job.  I will be back for sure!!!  Finally, a great nail place in North Phoenix!!!!They also have free wireless!!  A huge plus, if you need to get work done while you are there.",1
"This review is for the Sales and Finance team. My experience with Mercedes-Benz of Henderson was absolutely wonderful from start to finish! I purchased my dream car from the amazing Diane Casiello who went above and beyond in every way to make my deal happen! I was treated like a VIP, and I appreciate the timeliness of response during my research over where I would get the best deal. I was also originally working with Fletcher Jones Imports, however Diane's commitment to me was what brought me to ultimately make my purchase at Mercedes-Benz of Henderson. Special shout out goes to Mel and Pete in finance who were also awesome! The dealership was stunningly beautiful and a true showcase for the fine automobiles of Mercedes-Benz. My car was delivered to me inside a white-tiled garage, and my product concierge Steven Berg was great at helping me learn all of the great technology in my car. I also love the VIP program they offer - some truly amazing perks just for driving a Mercedes-Benz!",1
"Great service, saved the day when another company failed. Will use them for all my embroidery needs from now on.",1
"I love a good deal, and this is where it's at.  I went looking for a sewing machine.  But they didn't have any, I guess it's just hit and miss.  But I found a juicer, and they only had 1.  I usually like to do my research.  So I grabbed it, because they only had 1.  And the nice lady at the register, said that was the only one they got in.  So I grabbed it, and a couple of items.  But when I got it home and tried it out!  it was hard to clean, and take apart! So sadly, I had to return it!  No issues on the return.  But I will be back,",1
I'm so happy to have found this salon. I recently moved downtown and looked everywhere for a place that was clean and  provided good service but didn't cost a fortune. The prices here are student friendly and Dolly is really wonderful and flexible. This is now my go-to place.,1
"I did a lot of shopping during black Friday last week and purchased a few new outfits for myself to wear to work.  Being that Im somewhat on the shorter side,  I find that I have to get pants hemed alot due to my shortness.  I now have 3 new pair of pants that needed altering, and wasnt sure where to go.This morning while running errands, I spotted this place.  I never noticed it before, and considering Im always at Gold Bar, I was thrilled to find an alterations place!  I guess shes been in Tempe for 10 years, but in this complex for about 7 months. (I must be losing my vision, considering I never noticed her before.)  Anyways, I just wanted to start out with 1 pair of pants to give her.  I asked her when they would be ready, and she said that I could get them back today if I needed them. I think she might charge extra for it, but after talking with her and comparing hours, it seemed easier for me to pick them up today.  She only charged me $9 which would be standard for her to charge for a hem.  She measured me up and off I went!  So far, I am happy with her.  The only thing is she closes at 5:30 during the week.  Being that I work full time, its impossible for me to get to her before she closes to get my stuff back.  FYI for others who may use her if your in a hurry and work during regular business hours.  Shes open on Saturday but closed on Sunday.   More updates to come as time goes on!",1
Paul was great! He clearly loves what he does and is very good at it. He was great at giving instructions and ideas. He had a bag of props and other fun photo items as well. I just wish we had more time together because I am so happy with his work. I love that you get all the photos right then and there on a flash drive to do with as you please. He was also so easy to get in touch with and so quick to respond about plans and booking. He even helped us book our bus to take our family for all the photos.,1
"I used them once and they were very honest and professional. Everything I would have looked for in an inspector. Didn't try to sell anything, in fact told me how to save money on things. Hopefully will never need their services again, but if I do they will be the one to call.",1
"We didn't stay here. But we wandered the hotel and even got on the guest list for the pool!The decor is stunning! I love all the elegant statues!The casino was huge! Lots of slots and table games. There were beautiful chandeliers in some areas of the casino!The pool complex was absolutely gorgeous! Statues, a garden, a little fountain with fishies swimming in it! Oh and a bar! Gotta go to the bar!I'm hoping to actually stay here next time we come to Vegas!",1
"We had a pretty serious water backup, water was everywhere but the crew from Las Vegas Restoration were quick to respond and help minimize the damage. Very professional,courteous,compassionate and most importantly quick to react. They will be the first people on my list to call.",1
"This place is awesome!Being new here to Las Vegas and being a woman I was afraid of getting smoked by you need this, you need that and high prices.Brandon is service was awesome! He came outside to my car a 1995 by the way and tested my air conditioning himself. I knew I need maybe coolant and tires rotated and oil changed. I was hoping my air conditioning was ok, being from Cali I'm learning about heat here.I very very taken care of by him and Pep boys! Thanks to Brandon, give this guy a raise!Happy safe, cool, flushed out radiator, oil change and my new tires from California I needed rotated I am now driver on the road because I went here!",1
"Great find in Spadina, the kalbi is great and the servings are good as well! The ambiance and the washroom is clean, a little bit pricey but my family and I loved it here! We will come back for sure!",1
Great breakfast and a great staff! We had pancakes and Bacon and Eggs and it was all cooked perfect!,1
I live in sauga and I come here just to eat 1 flavor!! Try all of the 35 flavors!!!.Better than BR31!!!,1
I have been here everyday. The clerks knows me. They will start preparing before I order. Very much appreciated.,1
"Very helpful! And not anywhere near overpriced! I stopped by and happened to be after hours. She was kind enough to let me in and we built a custom bouquet together for my wife. The same flowers at other places cost me $80. Here she only charged me $30!!! And they were all beautiful colored, some roses were this red/orange color I had never seen before. She went over proper care and they lasted weeks! All their flowers are from local growers as well. I found my florist!",1
The best. So awesome. Vegan. Fast food. Drive thru. Vegan milkshakes. It's like an in'n'out just without the murder aspect. I only wish it was open later.,1
I have visited the location since my first review and I am happy to report that valet service is available...the wait staff has much improved and the food quality is very good.I was very sad that a great Chicago tradition of great food and and service was not prevalent at the new Arizona location. But with time things have changed and I am very happy it is in our neighborhood. My previous comment below from my first visit was spot on.I know the Giordano's brand and what they stand for being from Chicago. I have a feeling this restaurant once established will be in the valley to stay. Please pick the right time to dine in early and late to elevate a long wait and you will enjoy your visit.Great job Giordano's team.,1
"The only place I trust with my dog!! Every time I pick him up he is super happy. You can tell that they care for your dog as if it were they're own!! Spotless facility! Friendly, professional and genuine staff! Gus can't wait to go back to play with his new friends",1
"Yeah, it's a local chain. BUT, this place is effing amazing.Popped in for dinner last weekend. Waited about 10 minutes for a table (got one outside...where you should be sitting at night). Yeah it was 100 degrees, but who cares. The misters and AC make up for it. It's really not that bad. In fact, it's great!Once you sit down, you'll get a menu. It's larger than the table!! And a lot of the print is small, so if it's dim outside, I suggest bringing a flashlight. Kidding. Use your phone. Hee hee.I ordered the Big Rig. A nice hearty portion of rigatoni with a fantastic tomato sauce that has a hint of chipotle. Two delicious slices of garlic bread. All for under 10 bucks.The service is fantastic. Servers are VERY attentive. I peeked at the pizzas on other tables and they looked fantastic.THIS is your fantastic date spot. It's not pretentious, but it's not weak either. A cozy atmosphere, with great food that you can share. One suggestion: Try the Bollo Pasta. A giant bowl of linguini with a tomato sauce. It tastes like the linguini was born in the sauce (LA Friends...Gardens of Taxco anyone?....) It's all you can eat too. And cheap. 6-7 bucks.I'd come back. I'd also come back after that. I want to try everything on the menu!",1
I am a daily tea drinker. It is all I drink. I used to do everything Teavana until it went out if business. I got introduced to this place and it is amazing. Everyone there is super nice and helpful. I went there today for a very specific reason and the herbalist was so nice spent time with me and got me exactly what I needed. The tea here is so good.,1
"Edwin was great!  Highly recommend. After a 60 mile bike ride, he stretched and massaged my tired muscles. It was perfect especially since I forgot to stretch  after my ride. What made his massage outstanding was the joint work. He stretched and applied pressure along my joints and muscles. I could literally feel my muscles and joints release the tension.  I would definitely come here again!",1
Excellent Mexican food for anywhere not just Pittsburgh. We lived in California 35 years and this place rocks. Can't say enough about the al pastor tacos tableside guacamole and fish tacos. Skinny margarita was very good also excellent service,1
PPG has always been good us. We've been renting with them for 5 years and they've always addressed every single maintenance issue right away. Lanie is super nice and treats our family very fair.  Our recent house was being sold and we had to move but she certainly had to issue getting us into another house.  Thank you Lanie! The office staff is also very nice. Alexis is very knowledgeable and helpful!,1
"Excellent. My car battery needed to be replaced, apparently the hot Vegas summers kill batteries. I called around and being a Sunday afternoon, most places were closed. Chris who answered the phone double checked he had a battery that would fit my car. He came back onto the phone, said they had the battery in stock and it would cost $113 out the door. I was down there in about an hour (after my car was jump started) and 45 minutes later, my new battery was installed and I was on my way! I would recommend this location, Chris was friendly and professional, and prices are fair.",1
"Breakfast - the most important meal of the day and the best, especially if you get it at Matt's!My biggest dilemma at Matt's is only solved by deciding I can take home what I don't eat and enjoy it later.   Plus, I have to say no whenever I can to their yummy organic chocolate milk which fills me up before my food even comes.   It is truly hard for me not to get their omelets which are extraordinary.  I get basic ham and cheese and the buttery goodness of the eggs along with the ""real"" ham just make any other omeletes I have had just average eggs.  Then there is the frantic moment when the server needs to know if I want home fries or hash.    Ack!  Both are the best although I have figured out that I can take the home fries home pop them in a pan the next day and my house smells like Matt's and the potatoes make everything I make to go with them taste even better.They have scrambles on the special board that often tempt me away and the beauty is that they put in what is fresh at that moment.  Everything at Matt's is fresh and they only use the very best.  My other addiction is to their pancakes which just blow my mind.  No matter what we get I tend to get one on the side to share with my husband as while I don't want to get just pancakes I can't turn it away.The most incredible thing I have ever had there is the Huevos Rancheros.  I even had my name put on a list to be notified when they have them and short of a 3 hour drive back into town I will get to Matt's when they call!My husband is a true blue chop and chick fan.  He can rarely leave the pesto crusted pork chop to order other things, and then he proceeds to nibble every bit off the bone which he assures me is the whole point of the bone.  He also scores my jam as I am not a jam person and according to him and everyone else it is awesome.  I have bought it at the market from the makers as gifts.  The jam goes on the bread which is another treat altogether. Sliced thick and perfectly buttered it also is good the next day.Yes the wait is evil but you just have to manage it.  There is no doubt we don't go as often as we would if it were not long.  It is hard to go on most weekends as it is a 3 hour chunk out the day (for us drive time, wait time, and yummy time), but on Saturday's you can put your name on the list visit the market and return to find yourself top of the list.  Don't fear missing your turn for if you mark down you are going to the market they will put you back at the top of the list when you return if they already called for you.  My husband also ventures there during the week as a single and says he is seated within 15 minutes any time.  Please note he is a cruel man and he is told to keep his trap shut about these solo visits as my food envy thunders in.It is a no brainer 5 star adventure at Matt's.  If the food didn't melt my brain with sensory happiness the adorable picture of the owners' son on the wall certainly gets my heart.  Matt and Erenia keep up the great work (and the cute aprons :-))!",1
"My second time eating at Sinful Subs was just as great as the first time! The employees are so nice and friendly! Honestly, one of the nicest workers I have ever met at a business! The sandwiches are amazing! The first time I visited I had ""The Baller"" with their fries, and it was by far, one of the best meatball subs I have ever tasted, and the fires were fantastic, with just the right amount of seasoning! During my second visit at this location I decided to go with the ""Italian Chick-N-Vegas"", which is a chicken park sub with marinara sauce and mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Of course the second sub was absolutely delicious as well! If you do go to Seven Sinful Subs, ordering the ""Funnel Styx"" is a MUST, so make sure to bring your sweet tooth and keep room in your stomach for when you're done! Definitely one of the best sub shops I have ever been too, and I can't wait to see their business start booming!",1
"My almost 4 year old son has been going to Primrose School for a little over a year now and we've had nothing but great experiences. He loves going to school and is learning so much! My 5 month old daughter also just started here and we love her teachers and trust them to take care of her the way I would if she were home. The facility is so clean! My son went to one other facility before Primrose and he was sick practically the entire time (sinus/ear infections, stomach bugs, hand, foot, and mouth, and other illnesses) and he's had one or two minor sicknesses that didn't even slow him down since going here. You can tell how clean it is because when you walk in the doors it doesn't smell like your typically daycare center, it smells good! We've had a few minor issues but they have all been handled very professionally and promptly. I know that if I have a concern, not matter how minor, that I can bring it to the attention of leadership and it will be taken care of! I also know that they will be honest with me at all times, which I really appreciate.",1
I just found this place as a last minute dinner option last week. We had the best chicken curry I've ever had at an indian place. The prices aren't bad. The servings were huge and the food was delicious. I will definitely go again.,1
"We come here all the time and I love it. Donna gave us some great service  today. The food is amazing and the staff here are always very courteous. Anytime I have family come into town, I always bring them here. The weekends are very busy. Usually a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table, depending on the size of your party. But they are definitely worth the wait.",1
"To me, this remains one of the best buffet restaurants and I am always attracted to return there. I love the atmosphere- the nicely designed friendly interior... Yesterday we had the Champagne Brunch... umm, well, not really a champagne, but rather, a higher-end Freixenet brut... Still, a very good value- especially with the free refills. $35 per person including the tip. And so we sat there in style, and pigged out royally!",1
"We have stayed in many hotels over the years and this truly is the most exceptional service we have EVER received! Everyone we encountered (including valet, front desk, room service & housekeeping) seemed genuinely pleased to make our stay special! Two small examples 1) We went to a nearby state park to hike up the mountain...when we returned, dirty & exhausted, the staff was quick to hold doors for us and get bottled water in our hands...we needed the tlc and the staff was quick to provide! 2) one morning after breakfast, we came back to our room to watch the World Cup - our room hadn't been cleaned yet. In every other hotel, staff would have knocked and asked to come in and clean but here, she busied herself elsewhere and when we came out, asked if we were ready to have the room cleaned and when we needed it done. These might seem like minor things but they represent the constant attention to details we experienced! Kuddos!!! We highly recommend!",1
"Since Marie Callender's across the street closed- I've been sad. But Village Inn is still here! I LOVE their strawberry crepes! Today that's what I had for brunch- along with coffee, orange juice, bacon, poached eggs and a tiny bowl of fruit. They offer free pie on Wednesdays- but I was so full today I had to decline. Village Inn also makes GREAT French toast- with REAL French bread! Yummy! Sorry Norm- I forgot to take a pic of my meal- I was so hungry I just ate!!",1
"I don't mind if others tell me that they're expensive. Like Johnny F said, it's all about peace of mind!   You can buy a membership from them and you and all your relatives can use their special rates if they need a plumber.  Customer service/dispatch also gives you a two to three hour window (as well as a call on the day of) so that you know when they're coming.Recently, we had a clogged standpipe behind our washing machine downstairs and didn't know whether it was due to tree roots or just debris/lint/hair.   Initially, the plumber used the scope down the main sewer line to determine if there were any tree roots obstructing the line.  He eventually had had to use the snake in both cleanouts to flush it out all the grimy buildup from the kitchen sink and washing machine.  In the end, he only charged me for the scope (and labour).",1
Came here after exhibiting all day at conference.  Just what I needed.  Body is refreshed. Recommend.,1
"Second trip back and food was superb, again. Service just as good. The Noble bread service is with the trip itself",1
"I've always hated the dentist and after my experience with Dr. Kohlmeyer and his amazing staff, I can honestly say that I love the dentist. Everyone was very professional and friendly.",1
"We enjoyed a great dinner. Love their hamburgers!! and their shoestring French fries. They have this amazing 'special' French fry dipping sauces in regular and Jalapeño and they kick ass!  I even put it on my burger yuuuuuuuum! the (jalapeño) one. Jackpot. Delicious!  They have an ammmazing selection of ice cream sundaes, sandwiches and cones. Custard style which makes it creamier and tastier. You'll love this place.",1
By far the best pizza I have had in the Las Vegas area and I would also argue to be the best I have had in a long time in the US. The tomato sauce has a slight smoky and sweat flavor and if I were to guess it is home made. The pizza crust was amazing too and I think that had a lot to do with the perfect preparation. We had the Hawaiian and pepperoni and both were amazing. Thank you Da' Crust!,1
"Went in on a Sunday afternoon and sat in the bar area which was quiet. You have to try the lobster taquito appetizer which was amazing. Pacific lobster surprised me very much. The bartender (female from Chicago but moved out here) was great and prompt with her service. We also ordered the Shrimp Campechana and added some great salsa verde and a wonderful habanero spicy sauce. Great Tequila selection and just a fun place overall. Will be back pronto! Topped off with Cheesecake, delicioso:)",1
"I must say - when i see this many 5 star reviews i am a little skeptical but HONESTLY i had a GREAT experience with my dog Daisy at PAWS , it was clean , the staff really seemed like they enjoyed their job and the Vet REALLY seemed like he cared alot about my happiness and my dogs aswell. i will definetly go back",1
"Lucky boy reminds me of the small-town mom and pop burger shack you'd find in the 80's and 90's. The food is great, and the family that runs the joint does everything they can to make you feel like you're part of their family.",1
"Read the reviews and was mixed about trying this restaurant. I had run hotels and restaurants for 20 yrs and am a little critical. My wife and I work a lot of hours and wanted a dinner out so what the hell, we tried Irish Wolfhound for their Friday night fish fry. I have to say we were greeted immediately, seated in minutes and the server (Michelle) was right there. Took our drink orders, answered questions and was very friendly. Drinks came soon, Michelle took our order and I was impressed how soon our food hit the table. The food was hot, presented well and the fish was battered with a wonderful light beer batter. Usually all you can eat means you have to flag your server down and good luck! Not here, again Michelle was attentive to all our needs. I don't know about others but our night was very pleasant and I WILL be back, often! Oh, and Michelle is NOT a relative or friend. Try this place out.",1
"Must try their nangmyun. Spicy or not spicy, both versions are excellent!!Also love their steamed kimchi with pork (They are served side by side but not mixed together).",1
"Many people rave about this place in st-Lambert. I have friends from out of town who always go out of their way to come to this place. The food is good, I had a vegetarian sandwich and salad.  I love that they serve hot beverages like coffee and hot chocolate but also serve wine. This allows you to change up the feel of your meal. Are you going for a cozy brunch or a nice lunch date with some friends or loved one? Suits different occasions!",1
"What a great place. Everyone that works there is wonderful. Food is great and the price is right. I ordered the chicken with noodles + veggies and my boyfriend ordered the waygu and fried rice. He's generally really picky about food as he is fairly simple but he really enjoyed this place. Our chef was funny and seemed to have a great time with everyone at the table. I would highly recommend this place, we will be back!",1
"Absolutely amazing! Try the bacon, eggs and waffle with strawberry butter - holy cow!",1
"So, we just happened to stumble across this restaurant because the restaurant we actually wanted to go to a few doors down was closed.  And I couldn't be more happy. Our experience was delightful.  From the appetizers to the main meals, everything was delicious. Our server was amazing.  So glad we found this place.  Will definitely revisit and would highly recommend this restaurant.",1
Tabitha did such an awesome job! She placed me within 4 weeks for a full time job at a great company. In the four weeks she got me temp jobs right away to put some money in my pocket. Would defiantly recommend talking to her about an I.T job.,1
"great beer selection. Only one problem, they give you the same fluted glass regardless of beer style. I know not a big deal but why not be serious about the beer? The food was great. Fries, beef rib and gumbo were standouts. Friendly staff right in the hotel.",1
"I had a western diamondback snake in my backyard tonight. I contacted rattlesnake solutions and within 20 minutes the had a representative out to my home. Jonathon was very informative, professional and thorough. He walked my property at least 3 or 4 times in the front and back yard. Unfortunately the snaked slithered away before Jonathon got there. I am going to look into the snake fencing as I was terrified for my family. Thank you for everything.",1
"We have had our new vinyl plank flooring for about a month and every single person that has come to our house has complimented and raved about our new floors! Not only did this company have the most reasonable price and best products out of the 4 companies we looked at, but also they were able to quickly fit us into their schedule and got the job done in less than a day. Luis is so friendly and easy to work with, I would recommend them to anyone!",1
"I've been into Morphe a few times and every time I go in everyone is so nice to me! I don't know what's going on with these other reviews.. The girls always talk make up with me and about what's new/what's coming in next.  They have such a large stock of brushes, eyeshadow (palettes and single shadows), lipstick, eyelashes, blush, etc. They even have Jeffree Star if you're into his make up. Their eyelashes are some of the best. I can get anywhere from 10-15 uses until I have to throw em out. Everything I've tried has been great quality. I love their Jaclyn Hill and Dare to Create palettes! I don't know so much about their 35 palettes but   I feel like their new palettes are the same as the Jaclyn Hill one. You should definitely check out this store if you're a make up lover.",1
"For a chain franchise named Touhenboku Ramen, I'm not giving this a 5 star review for their ramen. Rather, it would be for their donburi. After Ryu's Noodle Bar moved elsewhere because of a fire, I've been on the search for another place that serves great chashudon.I found my answer for that, and it's Touhenboku Ramen. Touhenboku's donburis come in two sizes, small (to go with a Ramen) and large (an order by itself, comes with a pop of your choice). I tried the large chashudon with a coca cola, and I was not disappointed one bit.It was so amazingly sweet and savory, and blew me away. The delicious slices of freshly cooked meat were perfectly augmented by the portions of fat on the same chashu, the mayonnaise, and the seasoning on the rice. It might be a bit too savory for some people, but for me, it was just the right amount. The soda that came with the dish worked very well with the donburi itself too. I loved it.The dish came out super fast too, it took a few minutes for my bowl to arrive at the table.I fully recommend Touhenboku's donburis. Give it a try if you're into savory Japanese style rice bowls!",1
"Took the family to this show while vacationing in Las Vegas. We had a great time! The dragons blood soup was super delicious. The rest of the meal consisted of a whole chicken, brocolli, dinner roll and a couple whole red potatoes. Very entertaining!",1
Still the best smoked meat and deli food anywhere!  It is well worth the line up to get a table!,1
"Richard made my birthday. He's amazing.  We went you Yinzburgh Barbeque while visiting a friend that lives in town. We all lost it over how good the food was, especially the ribs. We live in New York so are used to having pretty good restaurants and this was better than any of the big names like Dinosaur or Hill Country. Get some ribs and chat with Richard. You won't regret it.",1
Victoria is nothing short than amazing. She is very knowledge and professional. When I started going to her my skin was in bad shape and now after just a few visits my skin has completely transformed! I am forever grateful for her. If you need help with any skin issues she is your go to person.,1
Well stocked. USO staff is always friendly but this is the best I've seen yet. I wished my flight would get delayed so I could hang out here a little longer.,1
"We had an amazing anniversary dinner at Naples 15! The atmosphere was charming and authentic. And, it is true Italian food! We ordered several items from the menus and we really liked them all. You can tell the owner is truly passionate about everything he and his staff create. We can't wait to return again to introduce our friends to this diamond in the rough.",1
I've been searching the internet for a good Toyota independent shop and  I read a lot of good reviews of this place here on yelp and decided to bring in my 4Runner for timing belt and water pump replacement since it was way past the recommended 90000 mile service at 116XXX miles! I did not want to suffer the consequences of what could have happened with this interference engine. Jeff is very honest and didn't try to break my bank  with repairs not needed. It took about 3.5 hours to complete and I had more than enough time to get to work. Thanks Precision Performance for a job well done!,1
"I actually found Sprinkler Repair LLC based on a Yelp search (they were the only one in my area that had great Yelp reviews).  Dave was prompt, professional, did a great job at a fair price.  He definitely worked a sweat up as it was 104F and my house has a very old and oddly installed system that he figured out (where I clearly could not).  I'll definitely use him again and recommend him highly.",1
"I am from NYC and I was at home as soon as walked in. It looked right, it smelled right, it felt right and if you are from NYC then you know what I mean. The owners are from NYC. They make the bagels and all of the salads. The rye bread was great. It had just the right favor and texture. My friend and I shared a rueben, a Rueben's brother, macaroni salad, pasta salad and coffee cake. I also had a cold brewed iced coffee. All I can say is that it was REAL coffee. I took home bagels and chicken salad. They were all great. The bagels are best I have had in the south. Everyday I wish I were closer to this deli. I almost left out the pickle. It was to die for.",1
Excellent!  Found this location on Yelp.  We have a vegan in our family so it's was nice to have something for everyone.  I hit the Thai Cobb salad (omitted the bacon) and added tofu.  It was excellent!  Will probably come back before we go home.,1
Really big store with friendly staff. The self serve dog wash is awesome!,1
"Love this place. Lola Rosa gives vegetarian a good name. If you are not vegetarian , you wouldn't even know you are eating vegetarian . Everything was incredible tasty and our entire group of 5 people all raved about how good our meals were. Just look at this gorgeous table of food... and then mail me your favorite dish and a thank you note when you go (I am in the states... wishing I was now Canadian).",1
"Billy and the gang are amazing. Delicious food, great specials, incredible service. We come almost weekly since moving to southern highlands!",1
Hamptons is the new kid on the block at Tivoli village and they are coming out swinging hard.  The food is top notch. The Cauliflower sauce that comes with the salmon makes you crave it once leaving the place. The Prime NY steak is out of this world and probably one of the best steaks I have had.  Service is top notch and they did a great job with the design of the place.,1
"Found this place after a Yelp search one night after 9PM when every other smoke shop in town is closed.  The fact that they are open late every night gets immediate stars for me.  The selection seemed to be like most other smoke shops, and the prices were average.  The guy working was really cool (and cute :-), and after I mentioned Yelp, he was quite generous with the discount and a freebie lighter.",1
"CUTE!!! Not only do they have cute clothing, they have cute jewelery... and even their sale items are soo adorable! This reminds me of the SF boutiques in that not only do they have french connection items but they also carry other lesser known brands. And their shoes are adorable!!   They even have cute chocolates and home decor items!! I'm swooning over this place!",1
I'm half Dutch and was happy to find this restaurant on the Danforth. After three visits I must say each meal was wonderful and authentic. The thick pea soup (Snert) was as good as my grandmother's and the poffeges were delicious and as good as I have tasted in Amsterdam and Bruges. The atmosphere is comfortable and the cocktails were loved by everyone in our party. Now one of my favorite places to eat in Toronto.,1
Wow...talk about service. This is a true suit buying experience. Simple and old school. You walk in and Barry immediately knows the type of suit will look good on you.,1
"Consistent taste (delicious), quality ingredients, attention to special orders, and friendliness.  ZZs has become my go-to for pizza and wing delivery.  I add a side salad, which has a great mix of the freshest ingredients, to have for lunch the next day. This place really rocks!!  Don't change what you're doing.",1
"A friend referred me to KaiZen a couple months ago. I had been experiencing hip flexor issues do around 6 months. Wasn't sure what to do.I decided to follow their suggested treatment plan and I'm happy to say that I've had incredible results so far, feeling much better and my 2 nd scan shows great improvement. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. I've training very hard my whole life and the thought of injury is something that has never happened until now. From now on after my treatment plan has finished, I will keep up the appropriate care. Self care is very important and I feel that my new found friend (KaiZen) will remain part of my regime.Thanks to all of you, I'm so happy with my results so far.This is somewhere I will definitely refer!Kimee Dufault",1
Amazing Boba! Staff is very friendly. Sat outside with five dogs and they did not mind (they're small dogs). I wouldn't recommend sitting on the patio long though with how hot the Arizona summers gets! We were burning up! Dog Friendly: They gave us a bowl of water for the dogs! Great place to enjoy boba with your pups! Love this place!,1
"Beautiful establishment and great service! The owner was making the rounds to thank every customer. If that's not great customer service, I don't know what is. It's a small business, so don't get twisted about the 11:00am start or Monday's. Try to support a great local business. I'm sure the million Starbucks will accommodate you first thing in the morning!",1
"Every Single Time this place is amazing. It doesn't matter where I stay, why I'm in Vegas or whom I'm with. No matter: I make it to this gorgeous and glorious, civilized and perfect haven for delicious food. I've had many different waiters here and all are outstanding, but it is definitely IVAN on this trip to made my visit most special. Stuck alone and exhausted during a loud and intense convention, I came scrappy and overheated with suitcase in hand, having traversed the annoyingly trendy Cosmopolitan to reach Milos on the third floor, east tower. But worth every step. I hid in the bar area, at a little round table, getting some work done and enjoying the $49 Four course dinner.. WOW!! But, like an absolute PIG I had to order the tower of eggplant and zucchini. This thing is a revelation. Forgo the bread and get this for the table. Ivan was my white aproned hero and he made me feel comfortable and welcome. Wrapped in a friendly smile he was a total professional, a psychic really - coming to my aid when my table was about to be invaded by teetering bar butts slowly encroaching inches above my candle. He arrived instantly and moved me to the corner table, averting a candle butt burning. LOVE this place.",1
"I love Zen! Everything about it is wonderful. The location, the staff, there service, even the music. I've been seeing Mindy for a few years and she is superb. So glad I've had Zen to keep me looking well kept since moving to Cleveland!",1
"The sign reads ""lost children will be given an espresso and a free puppy.""  I can attest to their ability to pull together a full breakfast, from the good hot coffee, to the cheesy omelettes. They have a lot of batter-type things on the menu - pancakes, waffles, etc., which is not celiac friendly, but they have a Chili-Chip omelette that is 100% gluten-free and is delish (omelette stuffed with veggie chilli and cheddar cheese), served alongside a nice side salad. You just have to make sure the kitchen knows if you have any food allergies. School is cool!",1
"Cute place and wonderful food! This is a must try! Their baba ganoush was on point! I ordered the Adana and it smelled so good, I completely forgot to take a picture. I devoured the entire dinner. Their desserts are also wonderful and don't pass up on the Turkish coffee!",1
"Some of the best tacos I've ever had that weren't grandmas hahaTheir hot sauces are on point. Nice and spivey. The prices are great and reasonable.In my opinion, better than pepes tacos",1
"one of the best body shops i have ever used.  My car was handled very quickly and professionally...returned spotless and fully detailed.   it was an effortless process for sure.They are not that bodyshop that will throw things together, use aftermarket or used parts behind your back...first quality all the way.i met the owner Brian and he was very kind and attentive...he is a true professional and understand this business and will quide you at every step.The office staff was very friendly as well.you cannot go wrong here...A+A+A+",1
We enjoyed by far the BEST sushi in Notthern OHio. Sweet Heart Rill a wonderful dish. AK 47 excellent. Monster Roll excellent. Quality texture taste all amazing. Environment modern excellent. Service simply perfect.,1
"Best place ever. Super cool teachers, spacious yoga studio and clean environment. Price is also very fair. I wish they had more classes",1
"Even though it looks questionable and is just down the street from Pita Jungle, Z's Greek is hands down the best Greek food in the neighborhood. The pita alone is way better than down the street. Everything is fresh and the owners are very nice. I have not eaten there, but call ahead and pick up in the drive through weekly. You should definitely give it a try!",1
"Upon entering the restaurant I was immediately greeted and seated. Very pleasant. The mood of the place is very warm and welcoming. Classy. The server was absolutely phenomenal. The way he described the menu was like poetry, his voice was so professional and pleasing to listen to. I finally decided on the pistachio salmon and was very surprised at how quickly it arrived! Not to mention how absolutely delicious it was! The server made sure to keep my raspberry tea coming! Dessert?! Yes! Breath taking! Strawberry watermelon cobbler! Amazing food! Stupendous service! WHEN you go, see if the tall handsome bearded gentleman is working! I want to say his name is Tony?",1
This is a great spot. My kids love to check out the various donuts at BoSa.Always a favorite for the kiddos,1
"First time here and I'm beyond happy I found Janet and her team. I was dreading finding a new dentist, plus I haven't been in so long, but they completely put me at ease. Everyone from the front desk to Dr. Euzarraga was so friendly and made me feel really comfortable. Michelle was my hygienist and she was amazing! If you're looking for a new dentist I would highly recommend Dr. Euzarraga and her team.",1
I had a great experience my 1st time at MedMen. The dispensary was very nice and i felt secure while making my purchase. The Consultant (Young Black Female with glasses name starts with an L) was very very knowledgeable about all the products and there affect. She gave me all the right advice to fell comfortable with my purchase. Sorry I couldn't remember her name but I'm sure its obvious why i did..lol,1
"I found Smok'n Hot Vapors by accident, and MAN was that my lucky day! I LOVE this shop! the people are SUPER friendly. Not one of those Stuck up Shops where they frown on you for asking questions! Real Down to earth People!! They have a great selection and Awesome prices! I started out with the Little Ego Twist, but when it was time to upgrade I knew exactly where to go , Im so Happy I did too! They sold me a beautiful 50W setup and its Everything I wanted. When it's time for me to go up to the Big Boy toy I'll be buying from them again!      There is a sweet selection if juices and you can Try everyone of them before you buy it, get it in the nicotine you want Pronto! That's why , when I need juice or coils or ANYTHING vapor, I drive my fat ass 29 miles to see them! They are my FAVE! to Sum it up... If you want Quality Vaping products at competitive pricing from REAL People, go down and check them out.. You will not be disappointed!!",1
Great Buffet.  Love the variety. Had a good selection of meat and bread.  Will go there again.,1
"Just wanna give a huge shoutout to Susan! She's an efficient, extremely friendly and personable bartender who knows her way around a bar and how to treat patrons and make them feel welcome. Wow! A couple of cold ones on a warm fall Sunday afternoon was what I needed and she just made my day. A true asset to the establishment. I'll be back..",1
The pizza and wings were excellent!  I would highly recommend this pizza and will no doubt order pizza again the next time I'm in Vegas!,1
"If you're visiting from out of town, do yourself a huge favor and dump the strip for a change. Why pay 4x more for shit food and poor service? My wife and I ate here tonight, and the only regret I have is that we didn't find it sooner. For less than $40 we both had a couple of Modelo beers on tap, she had two tacos Al Pastor and a slice of chocolate cake to go; I had 2 carnitas tacos and 1 chicken taco, plus all the chips, queso, and salsa we could shove down our throats. Service was fan-fuckin-tastic, and every bite was amazing. I honestly don't know why this place isn't rated 5 stars. Top quality ingredients made fresh, and tasty.  Try getting anything close to that anywhere on the strip anymore. Good luck!",1
"I've been going here for two years straight. I usually see Max, he's a really friendly guy and wants to take care of you. He is new to the office and he's doing a great job. I love the front office lady i always forget her name she always has a great smile and is usually really busy but always does a great job. the intake nurse before you see a doctor i am always matching colors when i go in there it's so funny. I really believe this business has had some good changes since the last 8 months. Very friendly lgbt doctors.! i really recommend the 3 doctors here they know there stuff! i've never had one bad experience here. It does take a week to get in there some times or more  but it depends on the time of year.",1
Great location even better leasing agent!! Hannah is super helpful & knows her job well. Hannah helped me get 2 different apartments & was extremely patient & responsive!,1
This place rocks-- its our go to sushi date night. Service is great-- chefs are fast and very personable if you are at the sushi bar.Make sure to get reservations!,1
"Loved this place! Everyone is super friendly, you get a decent amount of cash for your old clothes.",1
The food is so fresh! I love that they have a drive thru! The atmosphere inside is so cute. My kids love the all you can eat French toast. I love the salads! The fresh bread makes the sandwiches!,1
"I planned on proposing to my girlfriend on Saturday night when we were in Las Vegas, and wanted to do so outside on the patio. However the patio was closed due to the weather being too hot. So, when my better half was getting ready, I told her I was going downstairs to the sportsbook while she finished. I actually went to the restaurant to speak with a manager. Pascal was the manager who took care of me, he was awesome!!  He showed me where we were sitting, which we changed to another table no problem. We discussed the menu, etc etc.  When I showed up with my fiance for the dinner, he took care of us beyond my expectations. He basically was our waiter for the night, alogn with the amazing staff they have to assist. We never had to ask for anything, and staff was available at moments notice. We ordered the tasting menu, $155 per person. But it was one of the best meals I have ever had, and easily the best night of my life. The food was impeccable, not a bad dish. The tasting menu is the way to go, I would never do it any other way.....you get to taste everything. The langostines were amazing, the octopus outstanding, the ravioli were out of this world....and that's just the appetizers. It was the best $450 I ever spent.....I can't wait to go back for our 1yr engagement anniversary.",1
Dori is very knowledgeable and knows what she's doing. She was awesome and did a super amazing job. Reasonable prices and just wonderful. I walked in there one way and walked out transformed. Thank you Dori.,1
Dr. Williams is fantastic! My whole family has been coming to him and is practice for years and have always appreciate their great work and service. His front office staff is so friendly and always remembers my whole family! The dental hygienist are very nice and take care of any need.I thouroughly recomend Dr. WIlliams to anyone who is looking for a great dentist and a great experience.,1
"One of my two favorite Mexican places in the Chandler/Gilbert area. El Palacio in Gilbert and this are the two I go to most. I argue with myself over which I like more, each time I visit one of them..Si Senor's has awesome green chili! To be honest, I haven't tried too many of their other items. I had their green chili there my first time a few years back, and when I stop in again I crave it so bad that I just end up ordering it again. I kind of alternate between their spicy green chili and their mild green. My dad likes their red too, I'm just not a fan of red in general. Sometimes their green mild is pretty hot, and sometimes their spicy green is so hot I have tears and snot running down my face (if you like heat, you know this is a good thing). Although when it is that bad, I usually cry all the way home and promise to never get the spicy again. Then a visit or two later I forget and order it again.Salsas/bean dip/chips are always great. You get a round of sopapillas with honey free at the end of every meal. Love the food and I always have leftovers for later.The one thing I don't like is it is always very crowded and with a busy place comes noise. Clearly many people also know how good it is, so if you don't get there early it can get loud and the seating is a little too close for my taste in general (but nothing obtrusive). But when it is less busy and you can sit back and enjoy and eat your green chili and cry spicy tears it is about as good as it gets.",1
"Been coming here for years, not much to say other than: BEST HALAL WINGS IN TORONTO & GTA!!!",1
"Delicious! I went in with a craving for Mexican food and was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was.  Chips and salsa is made in house.  My suggestion get the mild and ask for a sample of hot to add a little heat for your taste buds.  The mild has chunks and fresh cilantro the hot is smooth but just hot not tasty.  I asked what was good and was suggested to try the most popular burrito.  It is a wet green chili burrito. Conveniently, there is picture on the wall next to the register!  I will definitely go back to this place....highly recommend Phat Phranks.  Even during lunchtime rush, ordered to-go and I was back in the car in less than 10mins.",1
There mango agua fresca is the bomb!!! Along with the food and there red hot salsa. Friendly service!,1
"There was a line of about 10+ people before 9am on a Tuesday. That's fine, it moved quickly once it started moving (aka once more staff arrived for their shift). Once seated we were greeted immediately. Got a nice booth. The avocado toast here is what was the most memorable. I'd get 2 for myself next time!! Also had the everything bagel and lox. It was nice. Mimosa was served in a martini glass. Ambiance is exceptional.",1
I never do reviews but being a surprise resident we do not have a lot of oriental cuisine. When Chef Panda opened I was ecstatic and my excitement was fulfilled when I tried their beef and broccoli. There was so much flavor. and the ingredients they used were fresh. You can see the employees in the back cutting the meat. Slicing off the fat. It is good to know that the food does not come in frozen bags. This is an awesome and tasteful place. Give it a try.,1
"Came here for dinner with a group of friends. Really busy and trendy spot located in the same plaza as Honey Salt. We started at the bar with drinks while waiting on a table. I ordered the Julietta, which was a sweet and refreshing martini. My friend ordered the cucumber martini. The presentation on both were nice and they were crafted very well. We ordered the following appetizers:Roasted cauliflower-served in a hot skillet. Was crispy and had really good flavor. The fried egg was a nice compliment to the roasted veggies. Meatballs-served in a hot skillet with a side of garlic bread. Good flavor and a good table share plate. Caesar salad-fresh and flavorful White truffle garlic bread-good plate to share for the table. One of our favorites. Crispy and soft bread topped with fresh ricotta cheese. We each ordered an entree and they were all really good. Nice size portions and good flavor. We had some leftovers. Chicken Parmesan-crispy and flavorful. Served with a side of pasta with cream sauce. Chicken pesto pasta-another favorite. Pasta tossed with pesto sauce and topped with grilled chicken and pine nuts. Really tasty. Squid ink pasta-flavorful and had a bit of a spicy kick Short rib pasta-sliced short rib on cream pasta served with arugula. Short rib was tasty and tender. Scallops-served medium which was perfect. Really good flavor and texture. All in all we really liked this restaurant. The food and service were great. Good place for date night or groups. We will return.",1
Excellent photos - truly beautiful. The whole experience was very nice. Stuart made it easy for the whole family to be comfortable and bring out our best smiles.,1
Great place to select a mattress. The sales people were great and knowledgeable and put no pressure on us. Also they were wonderful with our two younger children. We look forward to a good night sleep on our mattress!,1
"Tried a new place for lunch. The service was great, very friendly and attentive. Food came out within about 5 mins, perfect for a lunch break pick up. I have the teriyaki chicken bowl for $5 (great deal). I like that I was given the option of light or dark chicken. I had dark meat and it was delicious! Veggies were nice and crunchy and the chicken was perfectly juicy.",1
Some of my best sandwiches in Europe were at gas stations. Never thought I'd have a same experience in the states but this is the place! Even better is the car wash best ever! I can even have a glass of wine! The logistics are a bit confusing at first.,1
"I had a wonderful experience at Bravo Bridals! I've been to many different stores and have tried on multiple dresses, so I was all shopped out. Melissa, my consultant, put me at ease right away and after hearing what I was looking for (mostly what I wasn't looking for), she pulled dresses that all stole my heart. She was super patient, let me and my MOH take our time (we stayed past the closing time), and gave helpful insight into each dress. I felt right at home and walked out with a wedding dress that's truly enchanting.",1
"incredible church! Just read the unfortunate article over the email sent by one of the staff, but also saw the sincere apology. After being in this church myself I can safely say this statement bears NO reflection whatsoever upon the leaders hearts or attitudes towards any folks. They are warm, generous and probably the most racially diverse church I have ever seen.Their music, kids programs, heart for the poor, and love for their people is inspiring. Get there if you can!",1
"With a great selection of beers on tap, always having a fantastic seasonal beer and a wide variety of great food I could go here three or four times a week!  The salmon sandwich is one of my favorites and it goes great with an 8th street ale (which I happen to be drinking now) along with pretty much any other thing they have on tap.  Start with the wings or nachos and you will not be disappointed.  It's a great place to watch any sporting event.  A few too many Vikings fans for my liking, being a Bears fan myself but it's a great atmosphere for pretty much any time you're looking to have a memorable experience.",1
I have used Tulip cleaning for over five year's. The company has cleaned many of my apartments for my multi-family rental business. Their knowledge of the industry and troubleshooting difficult problems has proved to be invaluable for my company. They are big enough to do the volume but small enough that everything is done too Lupita's high standards.,1
"Get the egg tacos, add avocado. YUM.  The #20 omelette was good too, have it scrambled. Great service!",1
"If you can get in the door...go! Go immediately. Everything here is good. Literally, everything.Cute little neighborhoody spot with excellent homemade food. What more do you need?",1
"Do you ever get the feeling when you step into a new business and immediately know you're going to love it? Sweet Lorraine's was like that for me. This bakery just opened (though the official grand opening is on July 14th) and everything is not only made from scratch the day of, but they locally source their ingredients.  For example, the coffee, is roasted right here in Charlotte. The family who owns this business haas such a tremendous story. Michelle told me she's a pharmacist, and her sister was a bond trader in NYC. After their mother passed away, their father sat down to talk to them about the importance of doing what you love. Michelle's sister went to culinary school, worked in NYC, and moved to CLT to be with family.  Fast forward to today and their dream has come true! The location is lovely and bright with big windows and a bit of seating. All the staff are friendly and genuine, and oh yes, the baked goods are simp delicious! I planned on getting only one item, but was tempted to get three. Since the sticky buns were so popular they had sold out and a fresh batch was being baked. So instead, I got a fruit tart, a lemon blueberry muffin and a banana pudding- type dessert. Each and every one of these was fantastic.  The tart was not too sweet with a nice smooth pastry cream base. The fruits were fresh and not over glazed. The crust not too thick either (some places make it like a hockey puck). The muffin, which was recommended to me too was excellent.  Obviously there are real blueberries dotted throughout. But the muffin itself was moist, the top had a nice chew and clean flavor. No strange mouthfeel afterwards when you buy one of those packaged muffins, or ones from Panera.The banana dessert, I only had one bite.  It was fabulous and creamy and flavorful, but after consuming a fruit tart and big muffin, I need a break! (I'll save this for after dinner...or as dinner replacement.)Bottom line, I'm really excited to have Sweet Lorraine open here in Charlotte. In a city saturated with frozen yogurt and cupcakes and day-old baked goods pass as acceptable (I don't even buy the ones at Dean & Deluca, and even when the WF opens, they'll keep pastry in their case for a few days.) Sweet Lorraine's is a great change of pace. Good luck you guys...I'll be back for the cookies, breads, cupcakes and that deliciously shiny and golden brioche that was sitting on the counter. Mmmm!",1
"Single cut vs whole pie.  When I order cuts, it seems like there is too much grease.  When I order a whole pie everything comes together.  Aiello's has the best crust that you will ever consume. My six year old son and I finished a whole large pizza in one sitting.  Neither of us are overweight.  He said ""daddy this is the best pizza that I have ever eaten.""  He must be my son because I agreed.  I love there pizza and come from Oakmont to get it about 2X/month.  Stamp of approval.",1
"Bf and I drove to 5 Auto places and they all quoted us about the same $1000 to replace 4 blender Actuators. Finally found this spot walked in it was clean, receptionist was nice, talked to the mechanic which ended up being the owner, told the bf that I had a god vibe from this place and for $956 got all 4 fixed and a new battery. The owner worked with us and also informed us of financing if needed. Over all not only did they beat everyone's price but had great customer service.",1
"The service, staff, food and drink are fantastic. We rarely make it out of the bar into the dining room since Chase, Susie & Kate take such good care of their customers. If you don't see it on the menu Chef Jeff will do what he can to whip it up for you.  The Happy Hour rocks and everything else on the menu will blow you away.",1
"My husband recently took me here on one of our special date nights, based on the yelp reviews we have been wanting to try it for sometime and it certainly did not disappoint.The preset menu was spot on, beautifully presented, amazing combination of flavors and perfectly balanced variety.  The wait staff were so friendly & attentive, they really made our evening special.",1
"Love this place... Dr. Predmore was was amazing. She did exactly what I wanted and spoke with me on which syringe to do. I chose the Juvederm xtra plus and I'm so happy with the way my lips turned out.Rachel (the receptionist) is great she probably thought I was super annoying for asking a million questions lol. She answered them all, was so warm, and  showed me her before and after pictures. Very neat, clean, and professional. Highly recommend and will continue to come back here. Thank you to the staff",1
I was looking forward to trying this place for Breakfast and it did not disappoint! I ordered the biscuits & gravy which tasted amazing. Reminded me so much of my childhood and came with eggs & hashbrown on the side. Also ordered Chicken & Waffles and this was a win for me. Don't forget to eat it/ask for it with sweet & spicy sauce. (basically just hot sauce with syrup) GENIUS & FLAVORFUL. The chicken was so juicy and tender. The waffle was soft and easy to bite into. I'm looking forward to coming back again!,1
Delicious food and excellent service! Food comes out really fast and hot. I always get the Singapore noodles with tofu. Good prices too.,1
"For my new puppy, I was searching for a vet closer to me and for a good price. I called around many vets around the Markham/Richmond Hill area and asked for the vaccination, exam, and potential spay prices. Apple Creek lands in the middle; not the cheapest but definitely not the highest. What made me choose them was the level of service and the recommendations from a friend and also a fellow dog parent that I just met at the time that spoke very highly of Dr. Augustin and the clinic.You definitely get what you pay for, and I am glad that I chose this clinic as they are all very welcoming, upfront about costs, and the owner, Dr. Augustin, is really great. He answers all the questions that I have, even if it's not relevant to the visit. He explains the options that you have and even has suggested other options other than his own clinic (talked about different spaying/neutering options from SPCA/Humane Society, Microchipping, etc.). He's definitely not in it for the money and I find his prices very fair.I 100% recommend Apple Creek to anyone. Easy to book, easy to reschedule, and easy to talk with about any concerns! All staff are very kind and will help you in anyway they can.",1
"I made an appointment with Franky and could not have been more pleased. I'm a bit of a control freak and maybe a little ocd lol, but from the start he was calming and open to what I was asking for. I brought in a few pictures and explained what I wanted ( neither picture was exactly what I was asking for just an idea) so with an idea from the pics and me trying to transfer my thoughts to something some one else can understand he somehow managed to understand exactly what I wanted and turn it in to a beautiful tattoo. I'm Definitely coming back to him for all my tattoos :)",1
"So my review is solely based on customer service, and what I visually see. I didn't purchase anything only learned a bit about what type of pens we wanted and were looking for! Didn't know the difference of a few so the guy working took his time to break it down and help us out. Didn't seem to be rushing us to purchase which was very nice so we could test out all the pens we needed till we found something (or didn't)",1
"I had optic migraines before I came in for an alignment. After 2 sessions, the migraines are gone. I like how I can check in and be done within a few minutes, no long wait.",1
"Valerie A.P.I am from Seattle and visited Las Vegas last weekend.  My best friend's nephew has an excellent taste in restaurants and likes to take us to the ""best restaurants in Las Vegas.""  He was spot on with this choice!  Being from Seattle there are a lot of Indian restaurants and I have frequented many of them. I have to say that Ghandi has the best Indian food I have ever tasted!  The atmosphere is authentic and I loved the Indian music videos playing in the back ground.  The customer service is superb and they make you feel welcome as soon as you enter.  You must try the butter chicken - it was a hit with everyone a the table.  I am vegetarian, so my nephew ordered the sauce that goes on top for my naan.  I personally recommend the vegetable Biriyani.  Bon appetite!",1
"This show was absolutely amazing. The beginning of the show it starts off with a bang and it takes you on this emotional journey of high and lows, awesome and sadness. If you're an MJ fan you can appreciate the dedication that Cirque du Soleil put into his memory and his life. No matter where you have a seat, it is always a perfect view to see MJ's life message and the power he had over us all. 10/10 would see this again!",1
I had the center console of my truck tear right where your elbow rests. It was vinyl.I called these guys and they asked if I wanted to swing by and I didn't have time at the moment. So they sent their mobile guy out to pickup the console cover and take it to the shop!4hrs later it was delivered back to me wrapped in a brand new high quality leather that matched wonderfully. Can't recommend these guys enough. Fantastic.,1
This is the best Chinese cuisine in the greater Phoenix area. I have been frequenting Abacus Inn for over 30 years. They have the best Egg Drop soup and Egg Foo Young. Along with their other fine entrees. The atmosphere and service is always a delight.,1
Very flexible and responsive.  Went out of their way to help me on a last minute travel project in Toronto.  Ovais was very helpful.,1
Starving!!!! Drank all nite and slept most of the day. I need meat in my life. My brother recommend his place. I started with a whiskey and water. A little lite on the whiskey. The crispy shrimp is amazing. Bone in New York was cooked perfectly and and I ate every bite. Back to to the tables! Wish me luck.,1
"Gah! STRUDEL!!But I digress... This place is so quaint and the waitress so adorably German you just want to hug the life out of it. My friend and I came here after she got her windows tinted, and she was in the mood to be German.She got a platter of sausage, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut; I got the Spaetzl with cheese and a side of pan fried potatoes.The waitress was really fast and the food came out hot and quick- but my taters had bacon in them. I had no idea they would, and when I asked for a new plate sans bacon she took it back and gave me a new one. YAY! The sides do not say what they are clearly, so ask just in case.The Spaetzl was so yummy and fresh, and very good with the cheese (you can get it with meatless sauce as well, but cheese is better!) My friend devoured her plate, including the sauerkraut which she hated as a kid.Then we got STRUDEL!!!! GAAAHHHHH I love strudel! They have three types: Blueberry, Cherry and Apple, and they come with whipped cream and vanilla sauce. SO FRICKEN GOOD! Prices were moderate, and it seems they have a German Buffet here once a month- where you can have ALL YOU CAN EAT STRUDEL!",1
"My first time trying pho and all of my friends suggested eating here (many insisting it was the best and only place to get pho in Chinatown). The service is quick when you need something and then non-existant after you've received that something, which I find appealing because my dining culture revolves around talking and enjoying the company of my party while eating/drinking. We had the spring rolls, the egg rolls, and the Rare Steak Pho. They were all delicious! I had never tried the spring rolls which from my recollection are shrimp and chicken with veggies wrapped in a rice paper and paired with peanut sauce. It is chewy (almost like mochi) but with the fresh taste of shrimp really juxtaposed to the sharp peanuty flavor in the sauce I would highly recommend it. The broth for the pho is beefy, hearty, and will really warm your soul! I got the small and as it was my first time I didn't add any of the condiments that come on the side so I could just enjoy the flavors. I will definitely visit this place again!",1
This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. They have big menu with lots of delicious dishes. I recommend crispy noodle with seafood. The service is very good & fast! The owner is so friendly & always check  up on us when we are there. There fresh coconut is good too.,1
"Walked out of Travel Outfitters and wanted something quick and sweet. Walked into Le Macaron. It was not terribly busy at 3:15 pm (one four top eating crepes). The shelves were stocked and the owner was behind the counter. She was extremely nice and helped me pick out the most delectable and delightful scoop of gelato (pistachio). While everything appears to be on the pricey side (my scoop was almost $5), it was extremely delicious and the customer service was aces!",1
"I think this place seats about 15 people. Our group of 5 arrived at 1:30pm and for a while we sat with the friendliest guy who was finishing up, then we stuck his table to another table. It's not quite made for groups.I love that they have three types of veggie burgers, one of them vegan. Most of our team had Angus beef burgers and fries and all the burgers were thick and great-tasting. The fries and caesar salad were good sides. The staff were really nice. Some regulars showed up and everyone glowed with comraderie. It seemed like a nice place. In other news, they have a falafel burger. And a black bean burger. So I know I will be back at least two more times.",1
This is a very friendly place to get laser hair removal. My underarms are clean now. Now they have new machine. Painless!! Must try.,1

"Dropped in one afternoon to have a battery replaced on a watch that's been sitting unused for a year or so. Staff was very helpful and quick; they said I had ""come to the right place"" and went far beyond just changing the battery. Within a few minutes the battery was replaced, the watched cleaned, the correct time set, and the strap fixed. All for $10.",1
My son received his first hair cut at Kid Clips!  We are still regulars and my son is now 4.  Scotty and Rosa are both GREAT!  My son loves the play area so much we have a hard time leaving!  My son is always excited for his haircut because it is so geared to keep kids happy.,1
"What a fun thing to do, to memorialize a great event!The props and set up were perfect for the Epicurean Affair theme. The people working it were professional and kind-hearted; something not easy with an excited crowd.This is a business which should be supported!",1

"I love this place. GREAT food court, great prices both in the food court and in the market. VERY clean, organized, great selection. They always have what I am looking.  Great produce too.  Their seafood & meat dept is fresh, great quality, I come here allll the time.",1
He did a great job at my daughter's house....we're happy with the results.,1
"I lived in Phoenix for years, but never ate at Houston's until my friend Amie came from Wisconsin. We had breakfast there, and the food was great. We ate at the bar and the service was good. Mimosa was potent as I was tipsy after only the first drink. The price is a little high, but that's what you pay for the high end type of place it comes across as.",1
"Very well run, huge poker room with great amenities - from chair massages to a drink cart that rolls up to the tables - this poker room has it all.  They even have a lady who comes around every hour with a food menu and will bring your eats right to the table.  The room has a very comfortable feel and looks out from the second floor over the casino.  The only suggestion I could give them is to get table cup holders or those small roll up tables that other casinos have.  The staff is friendly and professional.",1
Good enough that I've been back 3 times in 4 days within the week I've been here in Pittsburgh. Tried something new each time and never left disappointed!,1
"Talented artists, professional and clean shop! One of the best in Charlotte by far!",1
"The vegan mac and cheese at Forage is enough to give this place five stars all on its own. Hands down the best flavor, texture, smell, and overall combo of ingredients in a mac and cheese I've ever had. Locally foraged ingredients make my heart swoon.",1
"Great place for some lunch tacos. Came here with a coworker on a business trip and we weren't disappointed. Convenient, fast and tasty. Also the cashier was very sweet and accommodating. Thanks Sinaloa!",1
"This park is an education center and information center as well. We spoke with Peter who is a ranger at the park and is from Florida. He is extremely knowledgeable about  the areas in and around the park. He answered all of our questions and gave us a lot of information.There is so much to do here. We hiked a little bit due to the HOT temperatures, make sure to bring plenty of water! The views were gorgeous, the plants and rocks were spectacular. We were glad to stumble upon this place. Many trails for all levels of people. What ever your experience level and fitness level there is a trail for you. Ask the ranger to give you advice. He or she will do a great job. If you have children check out the education series that are offered all year long. There is even Movies in the Park. Wall-E is next week. We may take that in, even though we don't have children! There is also a planet exploration day. We will attend next time too.I heard from Peter that Moonlight Walks will be back as well. When it gets cooler! Not into hiking? You can take a drive in air conditioned comfort to check out the views. I highly recommend getting out of the vehicle and taking in the views from one of the MANY viewing sites they have set up.We can't wait for it to get cooler and take in more trails without the sweltering heat, but the higher you go the cooler it gets. Today there was a breeze too which helped. Take more water than you need. Don't be that person who has to call for rescue! But if you get in trouble better to call than not!",1
"The best tacos in town.  This is my reward for anytime I'm doing well or need a boost. A little hidden,  but that's what makes this place such a treasure.  I was never a fan of pastor until this place.  Now that's the only thing i get here!!",1
"This is not a five star rating for the store as a whole but for an employee in specific. His name is Latrell. He went above and beyond to help me when the rest of his coworkers were too busy leaning up against the wall, disappearing to the back for over thirty minutes, or giving preference to their friends who had come into the store. I was in the store for over an hour and he was the only one who came up to me asking if I needed help when he was free. Others simply ignored that I was there. His professionalism and patience speaks louder than words. I'm extremely thankful he was willing to pick up the slack of others with a smile on his face. Keeping both parties in mind, he came up with a solution that was not only fair for me but the company as well. Thank you Latrell!",1
"Great food!   I will keep coming back, the food is outstanding the service is great.  Fish chicken etc.",1
"Server Jason fantastic...Excellent service, quite impressive how often servers stop by table just to check when they are totally swamped.  Food is good,  drinks strong, service great.  Highly recommend.",1
Their Kuro Ramen was soooo good. The black garlic oil had a nice kick to it. The pork was so soft it melts in your mouth. Wish I had order a triple order of the pork had I known. One of the better ramen joints I've had in awhile.,1
"We have known Tony for years. Over the past couple of years, he has spent countless hours perfecting the perfect pizza before opening Taglio. His passion and artistry comes out in each pizza he makes. His dough is light and crisp with just a slight hint of sweetness. He uses the finest ingredients from Italy. The levels of taste from each pizza he creates is beyond just pizza. It is gourmet pizza. He even makes GF dough if you request it a day ahead of time. Just let him know you want it. It is by far one of the best GF pizzas I have ever eaten. Tony's dad (at LaTavola) makes the best classic style pizza in the city but Tony's pizza is on another planet of greatness. You will not be disappointed with any of the pizzas he features. My favorite is the one with the Hot Honey..... a sweet and spicy combination of greatness. I love the fact that it is a rotating menu of food. Everyday you stop there, there will be a different lineup of food to entice you.Don't expect 5 star service just yet (it just opened so they are a solid 4 right now)...... but do expect a perfect 10 when it comes to the pizza and the food! Pizza Taglio will be around for years to come. Bring your favorite wine (may I suggest Ravenswood Old Vine Zinefandel $12) and treat your tastebuds to fantastic food!Great job Tony! I admire your passion for your food and so will everyone else when they taste your food.",1
"Great place.  We sat outside, overlooking the waterfront.  It was perfect for conversing, but we could still hear the live music from inside.  Excellent wait staff.  Food was very good and the small tapas portions allowed us to sample many flavors.",1

"Our sink backed up and our home warranty company sent out a plumber to fix it.  When snaking the line the plumber said that our pipe had broken under the slab and quoted a price between $2100-$3100 to fix it. We decided to get a second opinion and John came out to take a look.  Before he could take a look at the problem with a camera, he quoted a price to fix it at half what the first plumber said.  On the day he was going to fix the problem he took a look at the pipe with a camera and found no breaks in the pipe.  He even had another company come out who used a different camera to verify his findings.John saved me a lot of money and headache.  Thank you!",1
"So good, so fresh, so flavorful.  Like no place else.  Get the half and half bowl, the falafel, the beets, the cauliflower.... can't wait to try the brussels sprouts. Found out about this place and then went back twice before the week was out.  In my top three for Charlotte.",1
I was searching for a good tea spot in Vegas while I was visiting and I was recommended to 7 leaves by a friend of mine. I wasn't expecting much but when I got there I was greeted with the best customer service and friendliest people. Would recommend this spot to anyone!,1
"I am writing this review (albeit a little late) for Dr. Brian Shafer and the staff at Arizona Bone and Joint on North 7th St. I have seen Dr. Shafer on two occasions over the last couple years, both for Bursa sac issues on my knee. When I first saw him, I thought I had injured my knee and could barely walk. Upon examination, he diagnosed an infection in the bursa sac. He said it needed immediate antibiotics (gave me a shot at the office and a prescription to be filled) and anti-inflammatory. I was hesitant because I was sure it was injured with how much pain I was in though I didn't remember doing anything to it. Dr Shafer smiled and said if I didn't feel better in a couple days to call him back. I called him three days later to thank him and share that it was greatly improved. Fast forward a couple years and the other knee..I scheduled an appointment, was seen quickly, greeted by a friendly receptionist, and seen again by Dr. Shafer. Same / same...problem solved. I found the whole staff from the front desk, to the nurse, to Dr. Shafer, and finally the billing process for my insurance to be nothing less than stellar! Thank you to everyone.I found Dr. Shafer to be knowledgeable, friendly, empathetic, and would recommend him highly to anyone needing treatment for his specialty.",1
"Cleve has finally caught up with the fro-yo craze! Yay for Cleveland!You can find me here after TJoes. The place is self serve, and super tight inside-- poor floor planning. Per usu fruit, candy, cereal tops-- typically in disarray because it's mayhem there. You pay by the ounce.",1
"Everyone at Chi Foot Spa is very nice & makes sure that you are comfortable & well taken care of. I choose Chi Foot Spa over any of the other spas in the area. I workout a lot & am constantly sore. Chi Foot Spa is the only place I can go & consistantly get relief, prevent injury, & allow me to lead the lifestyle I love.",1
"My wife and i wanted to get italian somewhere on this vegas trip and we tossed around a few ideas where to go.  Carbone was a great choice.  The decor is beautiful inside.  I felt like i was in a scene from Goodfellas.  I called ahead to request one of the red booths for my party of 3 and they were able to accomodate.  For starters they bring out a really good bread basket and some salami.  We also ordered the chopped salad which was ok.  Next we got 3 pasta dishes.  The lobster ravioli, tortellini ragu, and spicy rigatoni vodka.  All were amazing.  Next we got the chicken massimo and potatoes louie, which was the best side dish I've ever had.  The portions appear to be small, but they definitely filled us up.  The server was also excellent, our waiter gave good and honest reccomendations.  I would definitely reccommend carbone for an amazing all around experience",1
"Very well mannered staff, Jet and Emilio are one of the bests in this branch. Very helpful people.",1
I have been coming to Canyon Modern Dentistry for the past 7 years... I cant say enough about how great this dentist  office is. I just had a crown done and was in and out in 2 hours. No follow up appointments needed. The Ceric crown that they make there is awesome and well worth it. Dr Castre and the rest of the staff are great and made sure I was comfortable the entire time. I highly reccomend Canyon Modern Dentistry.,1
"This hospital is the best hospital to go to in Las Vegas. The staff here are super sweet, they're caring and just all around fantastic. They took me and my pain seriously and when I had to stay two extra days at the hospital, every time they came in my room; it was ""are you comfortable"", ""do you need anything"", ""are you okay"" etc. and I really appreciated that. We joked around, had great conversation and they were very thorough in their care. Thanks to Carolina, Alma, may, Galina, Matt, Dr. Ching, Dr. Brumand, jovi, Sheila and Laura for being the absolute best care givers a patient could ever ask for. I know I'm forgetting some names I was so out of it but big big thanks to them too and the hot nurse that came into my room for 2 seconds. This is the only hospital in Vegas I would trust my life with. #1 hospital in Vegas is the title they have well deserved for the times I was treated greatly whenever I've had to be here. Thank you spring valley hospital :) you're the real MVP. You guys are great",1
"Many thanks to Dr Amanda Slusky and the entire staff working tonight.   I showed up with a projectile vomiting bulldog.  Everyone was helpful and professional.    I didn't get the best news, but everyone was caring and compassionate.   I've been coming here for 30 years now.  I wouldn't bring a pet I loved anywhere else.",1
"""The BEST gyro sandwich we've ever had!! (And we've eaten many!!! ) We loved the crunchy feta fries, the buttery rice with my delicious Chicken! We are definitely going back to this quaint restaurant with awesome service! Yanni's",1
"This place is amazing! I was beginning to wonder when we would get a good Korean place up in the NW, and finally this lovely place opened. The staff are super nice and very friendly, they come around pretty often so if you ever need anything you won't be kept waiting for long. The space isn't too big, and I don't think bringing in a large group of 10+ would be very fitting, but it's worth a shot! It was already quite full when I came at 1, and only 2 tables were left open. The food is great, and the one thing I always look for in Korean restaurants is good kimchi - you always know you've made the right choice if their kimchi is good, and this place has become my new favourite for that side dish! The price is fair, and they have a lunch menu that's also great for about 12-14 dollars. I'd say the only downside is they don't have too many items on their menu, but everything on it is already really good! Would definitely recommend to everyone.",1
"I have been a long time customer of Discount Tires, in general. I recently lowered my Truck with Belltech components. The front spindles created a clearance issue with my stock 14"" rims, so I needed to get new rims & tires. Too many Tire shops, just want to sell you the biggest & bingy-est rims, because they can make the most money. My mechanic, told me to go to the Blue Diamond Discount Tire & that they would make sure that I got the best setup for my lowered truck. When I got to the store, I was greeted at the door by one of the employees at the computers, telling me someone would be right with me, soon, even though there was a short line of people already. Sure enough, within a few minutes 2 more employees came in from the garage to make sure we all got helped. I got a guy named Bryan to help walk me through my choices. We walked outside & he took measurements of the key clearance issues of my truck & explained to me what he could do & what he believed that I would be happiest with & why. We went inside & looked at rims via Discount Tire's massive online catalog. When I asked Bryan what rims he would get, if it was his truck, he suggested 2 of the lowest priced rims in the catalog. I was shocked! This guy that I just met, got what I wanted for my truck. He explained that most of the chrome rims were too flashy, others too old school hot rod, & most the others looked like domestic truck knock-offs. After another 15 minutes of looking at all the rim choices, I realized Bryan was right & I picked one of the 2 rims that he suggested. It turns out, that they did not have those rims in stock & he had to order them from California. 2 days later, he called me back & I went in to have them put on the truck. Now that I have them on the truck, I can't believe how good they look.The Skinny on tires & rims: Make the drive out to Blue Diamond Discount Tires, they listen to what you want, don't try to over sell you & give you the best price & service.",1
"Getting a Friday the 13th tattoo has been something that I've been wanting to check off my bucket list for a long time and I'm beyond stoked to say that it finally happened!My coworker and I decided on Crown Electric Tattoo Co. mainly because they post their flash sheets in advance unlike other shops, so we were able to go in and already have an idea of what we wanted.We pulled up to the shop around 5:45 and the masses were swarming outside! The check-in process was very simple. We filled out the consent, finalized our tattoo choice, and paid up front. Shout out to the employee at the counter with the angel bites! She was extremely nice and maintained her cool despite the fact that there was an overwhelming amount of people coming in.We waited for about three hours until we were finally called for our turn. I was ecstatic when I found out we would both be getting our tattoos from Lex! I was admiring his work while we waited around the shop and I was blown away by his traditional American style tattooing. I'll admit, I was becoming really anxious, but Gabriela assured me I was going to be okay! My little ""unlucky"" tattoo was done in 10 minutes or so and I am so happy with the way it came out! Lex did such a great job. His line work is amazing! Gabriela and Lex were such cool, down to earth people, and really easy to talk to!Thank you for a fun event, Crown Electric! I'm looking forward to more in the future!",1

"Came here for brunch this past saturday with 2 friends and had the best experience!  The waitress (long blonde hair, very friendly and welcoming) was speedy and very attentive, and the food was out of this world (french toast).  Highly recommend!  Prices were on par for brunch in the area, but for the service and overall experience I was happy to pay that.",1
"Olive & Gourmando est un peu la madeleine de Proust des cafés-restaurants de Montréal. Bien sûr, le grilled cheese n'y est pas pour rien, avec son ketchup maison !L'endroit est toujours plein, et il y a très souvent le line-up pour l'heure du lunch. Chanceux ceux qui travaillent dans le coin de pouvoir prendre à emporter. Sinon armez-vous de patience car l'attente en vaut la peine.Et une étoile supplémentaire pour le service toujours impeccable.",1
"My 11 year old son attended Paint Monkey's Earth Day Frog class! He had a great time, produced an amazing painting! He can't wait to check out some of the Summer kid's classes! Paint Monkey also makes for a great Date Night or Girls Night Out! Joe and Mary Lou are fabulous, friendly and fun!",1
"What a terrific jewel discovered in my old mall!It was just about closing time, but the owners were happy to make rich, flavorful falafel, and savory beef saaj plates. My wife and I loved both dishes (the beef saaj is tasty, though very familiar - not particularly exotic - it is basically shawarma spiced beef in a pressed & toasted tortilla). The hummus was really lovely - just the right spiciness along with fresh pita. Sahara Express seems like a few other restaurants I've seen started by optimistic and generous entrepreneurs - very often after a little while the quality goes down and the prices go up. I hope that doesn't happen here, but in the meantime it really seems they are providing excellent quality and charging as little as they can, and I think they should be rewarded for it. Love this place and will be back!",1
"My family and I were on vacation and stopped in for lunch. The sandwiches were very fresh and delicious!!! The store was super clean, this coming from a person that hates public restrooms, I was impressed. The staff was friendly and even though they were busy with their lunch rush, made our sandwiches quickly and correctly all with a smile. My daughter dropped her glass of water on the floor and the manager, Antonela, came out with a smile, assured us not to worry cleaned it up and brought is another cup of water. It is very refreshing to see that even when it was busy she took the time to be friendly, courtious and make sure that the customers were taken care of. Definitely will go back when we are out that way and will recommend their location to all. I would give the store 10 stars if I could. EXCELLENT JOB!!!",1
Love this place. I come here 2 times a month to relax. Friendly front desk girls and great therapists!!,1
"What a great place to get coffee, tea or a multitude of various drinks.They also serve wonderful food and pastries as well. I love that you can buy a few healthy groceries and little kitschy items too. A favorite meet up spot for my friends and I.",1
really cool store.... I was looking for a gift for my wife and glad I stopped by this place. great selections and very helpful staff. my wife loved her gift and for sure I will be back for more :-),1
"I have been having back issues for the past six months, due to my work. Dr. Bates has been exceptional and is easy to chat with.  Check in is easy and they have great hours. I needed an adjustment yesterday on the quick and they made room in the schedule. Thank you. I have had over ten appointments and they have all been great. The massage therapist Alma is great. Highly recommend.",1
Jessica did an awesome job with my blowout and helping determine best products for my dry hair! Such a great place with wonderful people.,1
Awesome open late till 2am I think. Super fast service and very friendly male staff. Will definitely come back late night for a mani pedi or gel mani.,1
This is my 4th visit to Solid Nails and each time I have been completely satisfied with this my services!! Love my dipped nails!! I have found my new nail salon!!!,1
"I came here for the first time because I happened to be in the area, and this came up on the Yelp app as the best place to go for waxing. Asha threaded my eyebrows and I am so happy with what she did. She takes the time to create a shape that suits your face, even if there is a long line of people waiting. I am willing to drive from Vaughan to Mississauga to see her again. I highly recommend this place! Only $5 to thread eyebrows and $2 for upper lip. $15 for full face.",1
"First of all, awesome enviornment, even one of the best restaurant I have ever set foot in. Secondly, staff is kind and helpful, though this is kind of within my expectations. I am not surprise but definetely satisfied.Now, the main reasons why I gave it 5 stars instead of 4, is the food. It tastes EXCELLENT, appetizers was good enouch to steal some of the limplight for the main course, yet main course still remains one of the best food i have eaten. Dessert was good but too sweet for my taste.",1
"My wife took me here for my birthday as I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay.  Just warning be prepared to spend some money.  One thing good about lunch is that you can get comfort food, but still a lot of money like $25 dollars for the Hell's Kitchen Burger or a $20 dollar pizza.  Then if you want the fancy stuff be prepare to spend over $20 dollars on appetizers.  But just remember you are paying for the experience, maybe a once in a lifetime deal :)Okay besides the money part, the service is probably one of the best we had as they made sure we had clean forks and spoons every time they clean up.  They made sure our table was clean and see if everything is okay.We ordered the lobster risotto, beef wellington, scallops, sticky toffee, pineapple with coconut ice cream, Caesar salad and a drink.  It cost around $140 without tip.What I liked was everything on the food.  The only complaint was the sauce on the Beef Wellington as it was very salty.  The beef does look dry when you see it, but once you taste it, it is tender and moist.  Toffee pudding was awesome as it was very moist and the ice cream was great.  Scallops and risotto very good as well.We got to meet the executive chef Michelle Tribble from season 17 and she took a picture with us. I would say we would definitely come back here again and yes there is a red and blue kitchen working together.  Pretty cool how a small kitchen can cook so much.",1
Enjoyed the enchiladas and the yummy salsa after a fun Segway tour of Scottsdale. Food was delicious and just a right amount of spice and heat,1
"After disappointing experiences with three different vet hospitals over the past couple of years I am pleased our search is finally over. Dr. Avery is an excellent communicator - extremely patient, straight-forward with his advice and sincerely interested in our dogs. The clinic's decor is fresh and clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. I feel confident our young dog and our old-timer will not be over-medicated on the one hand, nor neglected on the other. Unlike several other vets we've dealt with, Dr. Avery conscientiously advises based on the pets' needs, not the needs of his bottom line.",1
The food is so delicious! So many options it's over whelming. Lol. They don't skimp here on anything. The portion size is great for the price. Fresh desserts and bagels made everyday. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive. They even have a deli that you can get cuts of meats and other goodies from. Definitely a must for any bagel/New York style food lovers.,1
"I have been a patient of Dr. DeSouza for four years.  I am so impressed with the Gilbert staff and with Dr. DeSouza.  They are caring, friendly, patient and treat me like family.  I am so grateful for their expertise in treating my macular degeneration.  Thank you, thank you Dr. DeSouza and staff!",1
"All around a great place. I went there for lunch, the lighting is low, the ambience is quiet and the food was some of the best I've had.Service was very good, the staff is friendly and helpful. I will go back every time I'm in Vegas.",1
Our food was cooked perfectly and they were very flexible when I asked to change a few things to my meal. Alycia was our server & she was awesome. Very friendly and personable . She made sure we were always taken care of with whatever we needed . We will definitely be back !,1
This is one of the best motorcycle not only Indian motorcycle dealership. Mark Moses and his staff are very knowledgeable friendly and courteous.It is a no pressure dealership. With plenty of old and new Indian motorcycles. Along with parts and accessories and apparel.,1
"Our family was hunting and wandering around for something different than our normal places to eat.  I have always been a Longhorn girl and of course the kids wanted McDonald's (blah blah). We came across Amberjacks. Best decision we made.  Love the old general store feel when we walked in. Our waitress was amazing and they had something for everyone of us. I had prime rib. Hands down the best I have ever had.  Hubby had beef tips, kid one had cheeseburger and kid two had ziti. All of us were happily satisfied. Reasonable priced.  Definitely a go to from now on.",1
This is an awesome store where you can get designer name brand items and not pay a whole years worth of your salary! Staff is super helpful and nice to chat with too,1
"If you go to Vegas you must go to Fat Tuesdays! They have an array of differentiating drinks and within large containers. I do believe this is a signature Vegas must have, because once you get your beverage you're off to walk the strip with a large quantity of alcohol in hand. Even if you don't have $ allocated for drinks, they have a shot menu with items for a couple of bucks.",1
"I have been buying my glasses here for over 10 years and won't go anywhere else.  They have an amazing selection of the latest frames and the staff are great at advising you on which frame is best for your face/colouring.  Not the cheapest place, but the service and selection make up for it.",1
Lovely ladies! It was fun seeing you two today at Ribfest! :),1
Wow!! Such a cute place!! Great music! Plenty of seating!!! Service was very very on point !! I'm in the service industry so I'm very very crucial about service... let me tell you Kylie is such an amazing server!!! Not to mention I heard she's a lady boss.. EVEN BETTER!! I hope whoever the owner of this establishment is sees this and gives her a world of kudos!! I never ever say I want to come back for a certain server but I most definitely will be back for her!!! If she's not here I'm sorry I don't want your help. KYLIE YOU ROCK!!!! Keep doing what you're doing you're truly AHHHHMAZING!!!,1
"We've been to The Montauk numerous times and we've always had a good experience. We love going for Happy Hour too.  The food, drinks, atmosphere and service are wonderful.  We loved having Skylar wait on us recently.  Outside of her efficient service, she knows how to assess her guest's personalities and responds appropriately.  My friend was teasing her and giving her a hard time (in a good way), and she dished it right back in a very professional and funny way.  We loved her.  We'll certainly come back.",1
"The service was great and the food was delicious. We got the dumpling dim sum, Kiwi Kani Roll, Potato Roll, Salmon and Lemon Roll, and mango/chocolate Mochi. All were incredibly delicious. Monday and Wednesday are half price on all sushi rolls which is an incredibly good deal. I will definitely be coming back!",1
"Great old fashioned bagel breakfast, especially on Sunday morning.  The place is very busy on the weekend breakfast.I usually have a bagel with eggs.  There are various things you can add, such as salads, onions, salmon, cream cheese, etc.There are so many delicious styles of bagels, and eggs any way you want them.You can't go wrong with Kiva's as your weekly breakfast spot!",1
"Where to start. One word AMAZING. First, this place allows you to bring one bottle per two people with NO corking fee! I mean if that's not enough then I don't know what is. However, it's not pricey if you want to just buy cocktails. Second, the steaks are really affordable. The steak price point is only $30-50. If I order the steak on the menu then I usually always get the filet mignon. It comes with potato chips and stuffed Parmesan mushrooms. You can also order a variety of different sauces to eat with your steak. I usually just eat it plain because the flavor is so good.Third, you can order specialty steaks. My husband and I usually order the Tomahawk steak and it's seriously the best steak ever. For sides we also love the portobello fries and the bacon for an appetizer. Finally, this place has bottomless mimosas on both Saturday and Sunday for only $16! They also have a filet mignon steak scramble that's literally my favorite scramble in all of vegas. If you want a nice steak house and don't want to go to the strip then go to Echo and Rig- you won't be disappointed! The service is always superb!",1
I got the house milk tea and the boba was soft and yummy. I would definitely come here again if I'm craving boba in Vegas!,1
"Really great food but wish their hours were a little bit more flexible.  Tuna tacos are amazing and the Umami Chef Signature is amazing as a salad, or roll.",1
"This was my first place to look for wedding dresses, and the third dress I tried on was ""the one!""  Professional, fast and friendly service! Loved my dress soo much and would recommend this place to any bride looking for her dream dress.  I just got married on Saturday and had sooo many compliments on my dress! Thank you for making my day so perfect! Once you have your groom and your dress, you are all set!!!",1
"These guys are the best, staff is friendly , very clean also lots option for pedicures .Will be back definitely .",1
"The food is delicious.  We ordered a few items among a few friends; shared plates to try each items and I have to say, it's all good.",1
This place is so good!!!! The BBB is so delicious & Russ has the absolute best customer service I've ever seen. He always goes out of his way to accommodate his guests.,1
Amazing food!! The place is always packed and the staff is super friendly. My husband and I love coming here! We've never been disappointment!,1
"In Canada everything seems rip off. However, this place is the best. I went there for car wash, this place is really worth it. Clean place, friendly customer services, packages under $40 exterior and interior cleaning is awesome. I drove my SUV from Texas to visit family friend. Then I went this place for car wash. I am very happy, vehicle looks brand new again, very few people are honest like them. Thanks.",1
Fantastic Time! Ian and A.J. really took care of us. Great atmosphere as well as customer service. If you get the opportunity stop in and grab a burger and beer. Try the Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale!,1
Wonderful experience....   So helpful and friendly . My mother passed away and they made a pendant out of her wedding rings. It turned out so beautiful I cried!!!,1
"I was already impressed by how fast the staff responded to all my emails. The lady at the front desk named Lissa was very friendly and welcoming. She gave us a tour of the overnight, boarding areas and helped  us feel at ease especially my dog Iyla. We watched on the monitor when Iyla was first introduced to the other ""campers"". Lissa went over everything before hand and gave us instant feedback. Their communication is awesome. We downloaded the app that let us see where Iyla was. There was always a staff member in the enclosure who was either cleaning, changing water bowls, and or playing/petting the campers at all times. I felt comfortable as I watched Iyla go from timid and staying close to the exit to walking around with her tail wagging and actually interacting with the staff and other campers. This definitely put my heart at ease knowing that Iyla now has a place she feels comfortable at when we are away or busy at work. Another lady helped us when we went to pick Iyla up. I forgot her name :( She was just as nice and so informative. I had a list of questions which she answered with ease. We booked Iyla's first overnight stays. I will definitely update this review after the boarding experience at the end the month. This review is long, but I know there are just as curious and nervous fur baby parents out there! :) PS: They even give you a card that tells you how the camper did during their stay and a cute baggy of treats and info for 1st time campers.",1
"Really good smoked brisket.  Great flavor and very tender.   We enjoyed the sides of Mac and cheese, cowboy beans and fried okra.  Friendly service and reasonable price",1
This place definitly is a must see spot if you are visiting Madison.  It is a major hub of campus and has wonderful views of the lake.  It is always great to grab a pictcher of beer and sit out on the terrace.  If you aren't drinking you can always grab a delicious coffee from the Peet's that is inside.  Heidi the barista is great and knows how to make a perfect latte.  Live music on lots of weekend nights too.,1
"Date night in Cave Creek and stumbled upon Pizzicata in  a plaza right off Tom Darlington before Cave Creek Rd.  Great atmosphere on the patio and bar inside with in door dining.  My wife ordered the lobster ravioli and I had the pizza  which was incredible.  The crust is low fat, no cholesterol and imported from Italy.  Highly recommend stopping by for dinner or lunch!",1
"Previously, I was a customer of another ""water store"" for about two years. Their customer service was slacking and I got a ""bad taste in my mouth"" once they disclosed the pH level in their water goes away within 24 hours...at $2 per gallon. What a rip off!!!A good friend of mine highly recommended Red Rock Springs Water. Of course, I was a little sceptical. Based on my previous experiences, I challenged the owner of the authenticity of his alkaline water. After a conversation, I make the decision to give it a try.OMG! While I've heard stories about good tasting water before, I was absolutely blown away at what I discovered. Not only was my pH level was still 9.5 after a week, it was also THE best tasting water I've ever experience.It gets even better...The better tasting alkaline water here was HALF the price of the place I used to get all my water. Only $1/gallon here. Plus, you can easily access even the alkaline water outside from their dispenser during non-store hours.I highly recommend the quality and customer service at Red Rock Springs Water.",1
"I had an initial consult for clear correct braces 11/20/17 at 7am. I had got there about 15 minutes early and was greeted by Dr. Perno himself. I thought to myself wow, how many times are you greeted and given the forms to be filled out by the doctor themselves. Most doctors would of made you wait until their front staff came in. He was very personable. I was in and out in a timely fashion. My second visit was 12/4/17 for a filling and cleaning. I felt absolutely NO pain or discomfort during my filling and once again Dr. Perno was very personable and humorous. The dental hygienist who did the cleaning was nice and took her time ensuring my teeth were indeed cleaned properly. The next day after,  I got a call from Dr. Perno himself making sure I was okay and not having any issues after the filling which was AWESOME! I'm a RN and not too many doctors will take the time to call you themself, so that speaks volume. Everyone from the receptionist to the dental assistant to the dental hygienist and down to the doctor was all great.",1
"Have been here for breakfast food and bbq for dinner, BOTH are delicious!! BBQ is definitely top notch. You won't be disappointed",1
The nicest piece shop i have seen in my life. Hopefully the dollars will one day allow me to be a regular purchaser here. they are willing to negotiate and are over the top helpful and nice.,1
Michelle is so wonderful!  2 pedicures with her so far and I cannot wait to go back.  Invest in the deluxe with her....so thorough!!  She is even doing my daughter's fills - fantastic job!!  She is an excellent addition to Serene - will definitely be the only one I go to from now on!!,1
"Service and atmosphere is awesome...then great food. A real down home experience. Definitely try the green chili omelet, spicy creamy and oh so tasty.",1
"Every Time I go here I love it more! Service is spot on, food is crazy good, and beer beer beer! Not sure about the low stars, they deserve 5. Love the pulled pork quesadilla, buffalo chicken wrap, the walleye is out of this world, and the cheese curds are the best in the city. Yes, the best. Great gem to Monona!",1
"So good! It's near my job but I never stopped in. Initially, I was going to the Thai restaurant in the same parking lot but decided to come here instead. So glad I did. And a little salty that I didnt try it sooner. You won't be disappointed.",1
"This place never disappoints, their Fried Tofu Fingers are the best. I just wish they would bring back the chocolate cheese cake",1
"This place is a bit off the TTC grid. But it is around a 10 minute walk from two subway stations.I've been here twice, and both times were great. Their Bun Bo Hue is very good. The broth is flavourful, and the noodles are just right. Their chicken vermicelli plate was also amazing. The chicken is tender and juicy with tons of delicious flavour and a touch of lemongrass which I love. The beef was nice too, but I'd opt for the chicken which was very juicy. The spring rolls were fresh and good as well. Overall, I'd definitely recommend coming here.",1
Very good for fast pizza!  Very friendly staff too.  We ordered through Uber Eats once and it was good so we went in and ordered 6 pizzas.  Very good for the price.,1
Love this store!!!! The geniuses are just that and always on their game. Watch out...it is always crowded and if you walk in you might not be able to walk out. Macheads unite!,1
"I'm not sure why this location has so many bad reviews. Every time I come here I'm greeted, the store always looks very clean and organized, and today both ladies in the store were so sweet and very helpful. They also price match for items online which is awesome! My favorite location for Children's Place!",1
"Gimme an M. Gimme an E. Gimme an A. Gimme a T. What does that spell? MEAT! Mission BBQ is definitely not short in that department. But, that isn't all this place has lots of...read on to find out more!I eat a low carb/clean diet and stay away from places that have lots of ""mystery ingredients"" inside of their food. Want to take the guesswork out of what is in your BBQ? Come on over to Mission. Simple, FRESH ingredients are used in their IN HOUSE made food. Nothing is frozen and everything is made daily. Or, at least that is what the amazing manager told me as I picked up my food.I was greeted by the most helpful, beautiful and sweet cashier. She took a ton of time with my family and to explain the menu. She didn't get mad I asked tons of questions and she asked if I wanted to taste things to make sure they were to my liking. Hell, my youngest dropped the lid to her cup on the floor....and she insisted on giving her a new one. Now THAT is customer service. I LOVE the fact this company supports our veterans and first responders. Thank you all for your unwavering service to this great nation! I was even told by the manager they would be honored to display any memorabilia​ anyone in my family who served may have. That makes me so proud to support this business!The establishment was super clean. From the open kitchen to the counters to the drink area and the tables. The floors were spotless, the tables weren't greasy or sticky (the BBQ bottles either) and everything was fully stocked. The bathrooms were also clean as well. Onto the AMAZING FOOD! Sweet baby Jesus....of all things righteous and holy on this earth....the brisket was OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you can make my picky 10-year-old​ moan with happiness, you know you have done something right. It was tender, moist, juicy, flavorful and just plain amazing. That brisket didn't need ANYTHING. The pulled pork and pulled chicken were equally as fantastic. The smokey flavor was there, but not overpowering, the meat wasn't charred at all and it wasn't a pile of fatty meat. The green beans were spicy and delish! I love the onions and bacon inside. The collard green were slap yo momma tasty. A good kick to them and I loved the chunks of tomatoes! Overall, I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could. The customer service was out of this world. From the cashier to the management and even the bus boys....a total joy! I will be bringing my USO cup back with me for $1 off my next combo!",1
"If you have always wanted to look at a man like a peice of meat and deny him with a simple wave of your hand for a better slab, than this is the place for you!! LOL........but no seriously, the food is killer and the cheese breads are to die for, but try not to fill up there is so much to love here! my husband and I come back for more prob twice a year and haven't been disappointed. He loves the fried bananas and I love the filet and rib meat.  Two tips....make reservations and save yourself a loong wait, and skip the theaters and redbox a movie afterwards because you will be so stuffed all you are going to want to do is lay out flat   :)",1
I really enjoyed the 4 course dinner cruise on the St. Lawrence. The waitstaff and crew were kind and attentive and attended my every need. The light show at the end of the cruise was awesome.,1
This is still one of my favorite restaurants. I have since moved to Avondale and still eat here once or twice a week. I now always get something from here to take to dinners or party's when I need something. The only time that I don't recommend this place is when there is a special event going on but if you are at event where else would you go? I have remended a lot of people to this place. Breakfast lunch or dinner it's always good. And clean.  Steven Julian,1
"This place is an awesome mom n pop sub spot, i was at the hospital up the street n found this. The subs are pretty awesome n tasty n good portion for cheap... I got the ny style 10"" for $5.49. I love it, kinda hidden in a neighborhood but its great. Support the small bizz!!! My new sub spot!",1
"So unbelievably delicious!!We always eat at the bar.Matt and Shalon are always there and wonderfully attentive, nice, accommodating, ... just super.This is our go to place and you cannot go wrong!!!So good, I wonder if it should be illegal.Recommend is with a 10/10 score",1
Friendly owners. Authentic Texas style brisket. Reasonably priced compared to other bbq joints in the city. Wish they would slice their brisket a bit thinner though.,1
"We ordered fried mermaid, pad thai and fried ice cream for dessert, it was all good and the service was excellent!",1
"My water heater was starting to leak rusty water so I knew it was going to have problems soon. I had rec'd a quote from a local plumbing contractor to replace the heater and it seemed very high. I called Water Heater Pros who asked me a few questions over the phone, gave me a price and arranged to have a person out the next day. The representative arrived EARLY (when does that ever happen??), checked the unit, confirmed the price and made arrangements for the next day. The crew arrived, early again, and the work was completed in a timely and competent manner. Overall, a very good experience so I would recommend this company.",1
"Been here a bunch of times, but never reviewed it. Best tacos around period. I haven't tried anything else. Why?",1
"Super fun place.   Bowling, bounce houses/obstacle courses, arcade games, beer, wine, cocktails, food.  Prices are very reasonable.  Staff was very helpful and attentive.  Almost didn't come because of bad reviews but it was great.  Combo packages so you can do multiple things for a reasonable price.",1
Awesome staff everyone there is so polite the onwer Jeff is an amazing guy. Definitely suggest you make a trip there if you need a battery.,1
Very happy with the service! The girls are so very nice and helpful! I got the matcha milk tea and did half soy milk and it was great. Very satisfied! Thank you for awesome service.,1
"The good:The food, the staff, the prices, the happiness at the end when you're fullThe bad: nothing. Really good place, just go before or after the business rush to avoid the crowds.  The chicken biscuit is Divine",1
"CONFESSION: I love lentils!!I will out-lentil anyone, any day. I've been to known to eat nothing but lentils for weeks on end, and I will sporadically throw a cup of lentils into any stovetop concoction that approximates soup or stew. Sometimes if I'm feeling sassy I'll boil up a cauldron of nothing but short grain brown rice, green lentils and an umeboshi plum, and devour it (with a smile).This is where I buy some of my lesser known lentils and rice in bulk. Rube of Rube's Rice is one of the oldest vendors in all of St. Lawrence Market - he's 86 - and he's always kicking around.Don't forget that in addition to the floating kiosk in the middle of St. Lawrence Market's basement there is an accompanying store closer to the entrance of Domino Foods. That's where you'll find even MORE rice and legume varieties. Rube's stocks all your usual suspects in terms of rice (brown, basmati, sticky, jasmine, wild, arborio, red, short grain/long grain, etc.) as well as some rare types, like a green, short grain bamboo rice that was infused with green tea flavour. They also have every type of legume imaginable - lentils like French, beluga, red and green, chickpeas, split yellow and green peas, adzuki beans, kidney beans, etc. Now go buy yourself a pressure cooker and get cracking on those overnight soaks!",1
Ripal is so good go and ask for her I am a returning customer and she always makes my eyebrows look way awesome :),1
Best tacos I've experienced in a while. It's worth the wait. I enjoyed everything about my meal. Shrimp tacos are definitely a hit. Will be making my way back.,1
"My fiance, his friend, and I had just finished dinner here. Man, tonight was awesome. From the funny and social  sushi chefs, to the amazing sushi, to the green tea mochi that topped it all off. The staff are amazing, attenative, and know how to crack jokes. The sushi chefs made me a special dish and it was heavenly. There are no words to describe the Mountain Roll. This will be our go to sushi, no matter what anyone says, and once they are able to serve sake, it's over. My personal favorite here in Vegas!",1
"We have been using this practice for the past 9 years through 3 dogs and 2 cats and they are absolutely wonderful.  All of the staff is friendly, kind and makes us and our fur kids feel welcome.  Every single time that I've had an urgent need to visit the office, they have found a way to fit me in.I want to address some of the negative reviews about Dr. Oster's personality - they are flat out wrong.  Yes, Dr. Oster has an Eastern European accent.  Yes, she is a strong woman.  And yes, she will be frank with you about your pet's health and your options.  Through the years, I've gotten to know her fairly well and there is a very caring, funny personality behind the slightly stern exterior.  I have seen her filled with worry trying to rule out illnesses for my one senior pet.  I have had very difficult conversations with her about prognoses.  I have experienced her spending a significant amount of time with my pet(s) and me, taking the time to get to the bottom of our issues.  I wouldn't take my pets anywhere else - in fact, we drive 30 minutes one way just to keep using this practice.",1
I'm so lucky to have Yafo in Charlotte. I went here for the first time at this location. I went to the SouthPark location food is still consistent. I ordered the build your own bowl with rice and chicken shawarma as a protein. The parking was great and the person working the line was super helpful since there's so many toppings. I also got a size of the Greek yogurt Mac and cheese I recommend you give this place a try it won't disappoint !,1
"Recently discovered Saku as I work and live nearby and love it!! Great quality sushi, and the presentation is amazing for the price. In this past month I've been there four times already and as a creature of habit I always get the same thing. Try their lion king roll, Washington roll, aburi sushi, and pressed sushi, it's a must!!",1
"Manny showed up with his partner within the hour to fix my broken AC unit.  I was afraid the entire thing had blown but he said it was most likely the capacitor and he could fix that right now for $120.  30 min later, AC blowing cold air and the day was saved.  Great service, nice guy, fair and honest.  Highly recommend.",1
"Good sandwiches and a very nice staff!  Always glad to support a local business, especially when they do such a great job!",1
Trash hash = Number 1. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Found a shirt for my wife even though they were quite busy.  We missed our table being called because we were too busy being tourists and when I came to check the list I told the host we missed it and they seated us right away.,1
"If you're uppity, don't let the name discourage you! This is one of those places where you kind of have to become a regular if you live close enough. I came here with a couple of buddies one night just to get some food and a drink and hang out. It turned out to be the perfect spot, given our tastes in venues and what we each had in mind. You walk in and it's open seating. The bar space is great; you have a couple TVs in case you want to watch sports, there's a big blackboard with all the draft beers (which rotate every so often) and the bartenders/waiters are all personable and helpful. Prices are reasonable, and portions are huge! Maybe too much...but who's complaining? I ordered a Reuben, which I don't regret the slightest bit. My friends got sandwiches too. We all have appetites. We all barely finished. Couldn't have asked for a better spot. I actually can't wait for an excuse to be back and try some of the menu items that I heard were really good.",1
I have been to Thailand several times. This is the best Thai food I have ever had in Vegas. Their Tom Ka Kai soup is the best soup I have EVER had. I also love the green curry and mint dishes.,1
"Excellent pie. I had the sausage & peppers; top notch. High quality toppings, chewy crust, super fast. My only disappointment was being charged $4.00 for a soda.  Pizza is reasonably priced. I'd come back.",1
"Consistently good meals ,great drinks .The chips & salsa great - just wish there was one salsa that was a Little less hot, but that's so so minor . The staff is very friendly & welcoming . To be specific Zack & Chris are Terrific servers ! So so nice and accommodating . Always welcome us with great warm conversation ! Zack- did you buy that water pik?Ha ,a side conversation we had !Such a fun local place . The food is very very good always fresh !",1
"I think this facility has one of the best Emergency Room departments in the valley.  I've received nothing short of exemplary service from everyone I've encountered there.  Inpatient staff was equally amazing.  Having worked in this industry, I appreciate the extra mile(s) that St. Rose staff has gone to ensure that I felt involved in my care and showing that they also were truly vested in caring for my medical needs.  The pride they have in their duties is evident in the outstanding care they provide.The hospital is clean and modern.  There are free phone charging stations and comfortable reception rooms.  The healing garden is a beautiful spot and always fantastically maintained.  The patient rooms are comfortable and include a nice sleeping area for family members who need to stay with patients.Highly recommend this facility!",1
"We came to this restaurant last year and again today while traveling from California. What a gem! The food is high quality (they use Boars Head meats!)and fresh and the menu is creative.Both times, we've been greeted by the owner who is extremely accommodating. They have fresh squeezed juices and also offer healthier alternatives to everyday delicious items. Each time we've been I got a Gourmet Grilled Cheese. They offer various types with different styles and meats etc. the bread is to die for! I think it's sourdough and a thick cut, and it really helps make the sandwich amazing!My husband has gotten some of their regular sandwiches and they were delicious! A good balance of all ingredients!A must have item is the Kale Slaw. It's a sort of cole slaw but made with Kale and it was SO good. My hubby normally likes meat and potatoes type foods and he loves the kale slaw! I also liked the quinoa salad!Everything was made very fresh and the service was quick. The first time we visited we were starving from traveling awhile and we were NOT disappointed. And this trip back we knew where to go for a good meal. I'm so happy to see so many great reviews, as we too love this place!",1
"If you want real Puerto Rican food with no frills this is it!Easy, reasonable and delicious!",1
"Kevin hooked it up! Ask for him - super nice and smart dude. He's a manager also and made my decision very easy. I was at another place before visiting this store where someone talked my ear off the whole time thinking that it's ""salesmanship"" but a good salesperson listens to you and doesn't pre-qualify you... which Kevin did all that, so he got the sale. Thumbs up",1
"I was really pleasantly surprised.  The food was excellent, the prices were reasonable.  I had kind of homemade orange whiskey martini that was fantastic.  The braised pork shoulder app and the croque madamme made it a wonderful dining experience.  Also given the location, you weren't fighting typical saturday night traffic.  I would definitely recommend!",1
Just had my volume lashes applied by Mikayla and I love them. The girls that work here are awesome. I will be back.,1
"Amazing cold pressed juices!  I'm officially addicted.  My husband makes fun of me because they cost about $10 per bottle but I feel like it's totally worth it!  So delicious and refreshing--I'll buy a few at a time and keep them in my fridge for when I'm craving something sweet--they keep well for a couple days.  My favorites are Unicorn Blood and Strawberry Fields (both yummy and sweet), their almond milk (they add a little cinnamon to it), and Skinny Genes which I think is a better pick me up than coffee--the cayenne pepper is guaranteed to wake you right up!",1
"Sometimes a Starbucks is just a Starbucks.  And sometimes with the right group of people working behind the counter, it becomes so much more.I have always had top notch service at this Starbucks.  They are efficient, friendly, polite, and make great beverages.  I can't speak enough to the quality and caliber of the employees working there.This is my favourite Starbucks to visit, and I'm so grateful it is the Starbucks that is closest to my office.",1
This was the best service I ever experienced. This company went above and beyond to help make my experience affordable and stress free. I would recommend this company to everyone.,1
First timer! Went great :) Victoria was AMAZING & made me feel so comfortable! Racquel (receptionist) was so nice .. I will definitely be coming back!$10 off your first visit with a yelp review,1
Loved this place so much went twice while we were in Vegas.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are a good amount.  I loved the taste of the waffles.  They were thin with the right amount of crispiness. The strawberry lemonade was delicious!,1
Stumbled upon this place with a sweet tooth and i was so satisfied i made a turn around to go get more for home...i cant wait to go back,1
"We had Sunny Plumbers come out to install a new water softener system, water lines, piping, and reverse osmosis system. After all was completed and inspected by Henderson Jesus came out to fill in the trench, do drywall, and painting. This was an all day process and he did a fantastic job on everything, you can not tell the yard was in disarray, holes where they had to do piping nor where he painted. You may get confused with my comments since both gentlemen that came out to work were named Jesus, the start and finish of the job. They both took pride in their work and it showed, we didn't have to do anything. The best part is that every thing works and it is wonderful.",1
"Hof Kelstein ranks #1 on my list of amazing Hofs, surpassing both David Hasselhoff and Germany's Hofbrauhaus. Why? Because unlike the latter, it makes me feel good about life. I mean, seriously... how could you eat one of their bursting-at-the-seam-with-cheese breakfast sandwiches and not have an optimistic outlook on life? And with latkes reminiscent of Channukah dinners or breads so fluffy you could use them as pillows, this is really all you need to be happy.",1
"A few weeks back my car was hit in a parking lot by a drunk driver, forcing me to get the damage repaired through my insurance.This is the place that works directly with Geico, who my coverage is with. While I have seen a good many mixed reviews on this site, I will be the first to say that the place does a good job and quality work as well.I put in my claim with Geico and was told that their next possible day to get an estimate was on a Wednesday, but that I should drop the car off on Tuesday just in case they could get it done sooner.Put simply, I dropped the car off on Tuesday morning, and had it back Thursday evening. The bumper was replaced and the work was flawless. The car looked good as new when I got it back.Again, I have seen many mixed reviews, but in my dealings here, the company has always done prompt yet quality work. Definitely recommended for Geico customers.",1
"I love this place!!! They have yummy chicken and waffles and donuts! I highly recommend it. If you can't eat gluten, their entire menu is gluten free!! And it is extensive. YUM",1
"Great food. Good service. The waitress/owner helped us with our selections. We especially liked the Walnut Shrimp, hot and sour soup and noodles. We had two children with us so they gave us a round table away from other customers. It was a quiet, excellent corner for us and the round table was perfect for six adults. This will be our new go to Chinese restaurant.",1
Very good/friendly service even though they seemed a bit under staff (very quick and efficient). Dim sum items were limited but just as good as the sushi items. My fav was the torched sushi.,1
"I have been going to Drew now for a few years with the goal of getting a full sleeve. If you are after a top notch artist who is a master of his craft, stop in and see Drew! I am on my third large tattoo and wouldn't go to any other artist!",1
"This place is delicious! My first time was about 3 weeks ago, and let me just say I have been returning each week since. The food is very fresh, and have several different ways to mix and match. When I say mix and match I mean different sauces, different veggies, and different proteins. Also the best part is if you're going in during your lunch time expect to be there a few minutes because it is super quick to get your food even faster than fast food restaurants but healthy ;). It is affordable and if you want to add avocado it's only $1 more what a steal and they give a good amount of it! (I'm an avocado lover so for me to have left over is a good thing lol) I've only gone to the tempe location, but I'm sure it will be the same satisfaction at all locations!",1
Love this place...Everyone was super nice and Jasmine was the best. Ive lived back in Vegas for 2 years now and this is the best set of nails ive gotten. Will never go anywhere else :),1
"This place is pretty conveniently located near my work and I always get the yellow curry level 4. I have found that their level for is more like a level 3 at other Thai places. The yellow curry is fantastic, it is easily my favorite thing from there. The Hor Joi was really delicious, it had a lot of flavors all intermingling and went perfectly with the plum sauce. The portions are great, the service is great, the location is tricky, but I will absolutely come back here again. I've already been twice in the last couple of months. The Thai tea is really nice, pairs great with a spicier curry.",1
"My favorite bird shop, even if it is across the country!!!  Jeani and Paul have always been exceptionally kind and have gone out of their way to make be feel at home at ""the Pickle""!  My birds absolutely love all of the toys I get fromThe Pickle, and I'm hoping for a flock addition from them this year.  The previous raters obviously have personal issues or conflicts with the Pickle Staff.  For that I am sorry.  I have found The Pickle to be welcoming and friendly!  Frankly I'm glad that they are so fastidious regarding hand sanitizing and ""screening"" potential owners.  Let's face it- birds are not for everyone, and it is ALWAYS the bird that loses when appropriate owners are not matched!",1
"I've been meaning to try this place for a little while now, and last night I finally got the chance! My boyfriend ordered it while I was at work, and when I got home I was starving! I saw the pizza box and devoured it! Despite being cold from being out for a few hours, it was so delicious!!! I knew right away it wasn't the normal places we order from. The sauce had the perfect garlic touch and the crust was the perfect amount of doughy and crunchy for me. All the ingredients tasted superior and fresh. I'm not even typically a fan of cold pizza, so I can't even imagine how wonderful this is fresh and hot. I can't wait to try out more of their items!!",1
Loved this place. It's not your authentic Mexican Restaurant but the concept is really good. It's different but super tasty fusion. I had the Octopus Tacos that were so good and my husband had the Shrimp Enchiladas that were delicious also. Hope to go back soon and try more dishes,1
"Oh my. I just love tacos, especially when they're made right. This place makes them right. My favorites would be the adobada and asada, squirt some lemon on them and it's just too good. It's no wonder they're so busy, they're a poorly-kept local's secret! Oh my gosh these tacos are good.",1
Well we had seen the reviews on NextDoor and it being so close to home we decided to try this GREAT new place tonight. Our dear landlady was going to come with us but she had to cancel . Feel better soon dear lady.  Now back to Sals !!! Great place and service / food is good too. Greg had the lasagna and I had chicken parm. Definite YES !!  Many items on the menu to choose from it's hard to decide. Come hungry as the portions are nice.,1
"So, I first found this place myself by looking through Yelp. At first I was a little hesitant because going somewhere for the first time is always a little scary. Honestly I'm so glad that I did though. So here's my experience.The environment is very clean and well kept, also super friendly and welcoming. They have so much variety of jewelry that you can chose from, etc. I also had called ahead of time to inquiry, and to see if I needed an appointment because it was going to be 3 of us altogether who would be getting a piercing. Vaughn was able to answer all my questions and said no appointment was needed, and let me know what time the piercer would be available.I decided to go with Jordan because I seen a lot of good yelp reviews about him. Now I can see why. If I could use a word past amazing to describe a person, that's Jordan. Jordan was absolutely BEYOND AMAZING! He's so nice, outgoing, and very confident in what he does. I was getting a nose piercing. He made sure to mark my nose first to make sure I liked the placement. He also explained the importance of different positioning of the piercing in case I wanted to switch it out later. He kept his areas clean and sanitized, and even wiped off the place I would be sitting. I was very nervous, but he made me feel very calm. Before I could even have the time to freak out, the piercing was done.He was very quick and precise. He also pierced my sister's nose and my friend's nose, we loved them! My sister was even more nervous than I was, and he even took the time to make sure she was calm first, even offered her a cold beverage. That's different to me because most people just want you in and out and that's it. He made sure to explain aftercare, and reassured us that if any problems occur he was just a call or message away. I will definitely be back here for all my future piercings.So if you're contemplating about getting any type of piercing, I say you DO IT and go see JORDAN!!! You won't regret it :)",1
Went in for happy hour with a group of friends last night to catch the tail end of happy hour. Everything was amazing from the delicious margaritas to the tasty tacos. The ambiance is just stunning. Our serve Marissa took great care of us and doubled as our photographer as well. May even pop back in the evening for some Cinco De Mayo fun. This place is a MUST!,1
"Last night I made my 1st visit with a friend of mine for a social Event with a beer lovers Group that I helped organize in the past.  Our Group had a reservation and due to our expected numbers the venue put us on their fairly small 2nd floor - which is their private Event space - with a separate bar, bartender and server.  As we did at 2 other venues earlier, my friend and I decided to share a beer and we chose their Barlie Brown, a brown ale which we both agreed was quite good.  I didn't order anything to eat while there so can't really comment on their food but as the Brewery isn't far from where I live I hope to make it back there fairly soon for either a meal or a snack (and more beer).The person in our Group who organized the Event arranged for us to have a tour of the Brewery awhile after we arrived, which was a quite informative experience provided by a quite friendly member of their Brewing Team.  The entire venue has a fairly upscale appearance - especially for a Brewery - and is quite spacious overall, although as I previously mentioned their 2nd floor private space is small.  Their service appeared to be quite prompt and even more so considering our Group was fairly large, with more people arriving as it became later.As a fairly new addition to the neighbourhood I'm certain there has been a number of adjustments made since they opened to try to increase and maintain their palpability; as my 1st visit wasn't an extremely lengthy one I'm giving the Brewery the benefit with a 5 star rating, based on the service, my overall impression of the venue, the quality of the beer I shared and the tour.",1
Still the best bufet on the Las Vegas Strip.  The quality is higher here.  I especially like the made to order mac n cheese.  The desserts are world class and the atmosphere is classy.  I love the osso bucco and the sushi!,1
I was very satisfied with my meal and customer service!!!highly recommended family restaurant,1
I'd never seen so many 5 star reviews and now I know why. I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful passing of my beloved Sampson. The ladies were courteous and respectful the entire time. They asked me to share my memories with him before the injection. I am glad that a friend recommended me to Angel Vet.There is not a more respectful and loving way to send your pet into heaven than to have these ladies come to the comfort of your pets own backyard to set them free. Thank you so much for everything during this difficult time.,1
What an amazing place for a great Asian lunch at a phenomenal price!  it is close to home so I have taken a variety of friends to lunch here more than a dozen times and have never been disappointed.  The service is friendly and quick and the food is consistently fresh and tasty.,1
"I have not been to many storage units, but this is honestly the only one you need to pay a visit to if you are needing a storage unit in the Henderson area. I had to move my storage unit for work from one location to another and they made the process so easy. I emailed them a week prior and they got back to me so quickly. I decided to scope out the place in person to see what it was like and I was greeted by the most incredibly friendly staff. I inquired about a 10x10 unit and when I asked if I could take a peak at one they had available before I moved forward with my purchase, they had no problem showing me it. I decided to move forward with purchasing the unit and they made the process so easy. I needed to put it under my company's name and they mentioned it was no problem. I just had to get an email from someone at the company stating it was okay. Super easy! I had my manager email them and we were all set in a matter of minutes.They walked me through the process very easily and explained everything before I signed. When I finished up, they even gave me a lock to borrow for the time being so I didn't have to purchase on there. If you're looking for good prices and kind people, this is definitely the place to go! I'm so happy that I decided to move my storage unit here and will be a customer for as long as I can!",1
"Mani, pedi, hair cut and color. They do it all and they do it the best. Love coming here. Really friendly people, great prices, and great work. I won't be going anywhere else for my hair or nails.",1
"I was craving some chicken and was recommended  to this place by a friend and man was it great. We got a grilled chicken and fried chicken sandwich (cut each in half so we could try both). Both chicken sandwiches were awesome but my personal favourite was the fried one. I liked how the chicken was not over breaded like some places and I could actually taste it. Everything was well put together and I had no complaints about the service , I plan to go back again to try the philly cheese steak which looked yummy as well.",1
"This place is one of the best greasy spoons I have tried in Vegas so far.  The gyro fries were incredible.  The pastrami burger is perfect.  The meat is well cooked, tender, and so well cooked that the fatty portions of the meat are translucent.  Perfect.  You can taste the coriander, spices, and seasoning.  The cherry lemonade was great, too!  Will be back soon.",1
David Silver was so helpful in buying my car. I was very impressed with the service that I received. The car is more than I expected with service that I have never received anywhere else. I'll buy my next car from this dealership again.,1
WOW.   Found the team on yelp at 4pm. They showed up on time at 8:30 and my wife and I got one of the best couples massages we have ever had and we have stared at the best resorts all over the world.   Best part is we can walk 10 ft to our bed right afterward,1
Yum Yum Yum.  I've been going to Jinya for about a year.  Food is consistently delicious and the service is always friendly & prompt.  I generally get the Tonkotsu Spicy but the last time I got the bowl with the brussel sprouts (can't remember it's name). It was fabulous.  It is a small restaurant and fills up quickly.  So we usually get there early & have no problem with seating.,1
"We have been visiting The Source dispensary on Eastern since they have opened. Every time we go in we feel right at home. Everyone always remembers us and our big white dog Burger. All of the staff is always so helpful and knowledgeable. We were in today and Dylan helped me pick out a nice strain, Dylan also handed me a sample of Seventh Sense CBD deep relief eucalyptus spearmint cream. I love the product, I used it on my shoulder that I recently screwed up while surfing. The cream has really helped out. Thanks again Dylan. I also want to mention Doug, I had to call the source on eastern with a question and Doug was super polite and very helpful. If your looking for a dispensary that really has top quality products and great prices and wonderful staff The Source is your place. Thanks again.",1
"The Best Ice cream, in town! Great place to bring the kids, and have a good time. The staff is very kid friendly.",1
"If you need CPR/AED/First Aid Certification..THIS is the place to GO!!It is conveniently located and was spotless and pristine inside. The couple that run it are incredibly friendly and personable.Kerrie teaches the class and they have plenty of space with 7 stations to work at, each with demonstration 'dummies' that are sanitary and very well-maintained.She has a great personality, in addition to her being a nurse with hands-on experience, which makes the entire learning process fun and enjoyable.I highly recommend Desert Education Solutions and will absolutely return there when my certification needs to be renewed!",1
"We recently purchased a 20 year old home in North Scottsdale that was gutted and flipped (to us). The one thing the seller did NOT do with the remodel, was cabinets. He saved $$$ by simply painting the old cabinets and it really looked out of place with the quality of the other items he did. I found Better Than New Kitchens and Dan Oldejans, here on Yelp. After searching around the interweb a bit more, I found that his business had FAR SUPERIOR ratings and reviews than anyone else...hands down. So we went with him. The outcome???? Phenomenal! All we did was a reface, but man oh man, unless you open a cupboard door, or drawer...you'd NEVER know it!! The workmanship was more like ""craftsmanship"". Dan and his team worked clean, precise and professional. We couldn't be happier with the entire process...from the first phone call, to the final walk through. His pricing is fair and equitable, and he is not afraid to be honest about certain things you can do to save $$$ without compromising the quality of the job. It was refreshing to use a licensed contractor that was on time, respectful and above all... High Quality!!",1
"This is such a perfect little gem in the heart of downtown Waxhaw. Another bonus is that a candy shop is opening up next door. There are lots of flavors to choose from. You will see your standard snow cone flavors and some odd choices like dill pickle and toothpasted. Whatever flavor you decide, I will recommend the marshmallow topping it is divine. The now cone is more like eating fluffy snow than chopped ice so it melts in your mouth like cotton candy. The staff make sure they get the syrup from the top of the cone to the bottom. Prices are very reasonable. They encourage you to bring your dogs (only outdoor seating) and make sure to treat your pet to the pup cup. It comes in vanilla or peanut butter and has a dog treat on top for only $1. The kiddie cup is $2, regular $3, and avalanche is $5.",1
Always friendly and kind. Will work super fast just to accommodate my busy schedule.  Not once was I turned away or had to wait long. They take great care of me and my little girls.,1
"I don't do barbers. I don't do barbers because several reasons; however, this is the morning of Easter and everywhere seems to be closed. I have tried to come here before because the reviews were amazing, but it just seemed to never happen. When every other shop was closed, UpTown Barbershop was open! We called and they answered right away. It was about a 15 min wait to be seen, which is reasonable. During the cut small talk was natural and not forced. The vibe is very much a bunch of guys hanging out doing what they love - making people feel good about the way they look.  The cut was followed by a quick neck shave and a massage - not expected but definitely makes a difference in total experience. As a gent, it's easy to go to the cheapest place for a haircut due to the rate your hair grows. Easily $30-60 a month to manage short to medium hair. The level of attention that they use to make sure your hair looks great, makes me think: maybe it's not so bad to pay a little extra to have a good looking cut.",1
My favorite coffee shop in Scottsdale hands down. Great coffee and great (and I mean great) desserts! Really can't go wrong here - except by not trying it!,1
"We love this place.  Tacos are awesome!!  They have Taco Tuesdays where you get 20% off.  The place is nothing fancy,  but the tacos are just like what you used to get down in Tijuana food.",1
"I just got back from another great stay at the MGM Grand! I am always surprised at the low ratings this place gets on Yelp. We used the Airport Check-in and got our room set up just the way we wanted, including getting a room early.  If you are flying into Vegas, take advantage of this service because the lines at the hotel front desk are crazy long!The MGM is huge, but contrary to other reviews on here, I believe it is well designed and easy to navigate. I use a wheelchair and it never takes me more than a few minutes to get anywhere on the property.  Just a reminder to all my Yelp friends out there...ALL casinos are designed to make you walk by those pretty little Slot Machines as much as possible. That's how they make their money. Don't expect anything different.Our room didn't have all the bells and whistles of some Casinos, but at $49 a night, I am not complaining. It was well designed for a wheelchair user, except for the Shower, which had the bench, hand held unit and the controls all jammed into one corner, which would've made things a little difficult if I'd been alone.  Luckily, my Girlfriend and I turned it into a positive (wink, wink!). Ok, sorry if that was Too Much Information.Every time I've stayed here the staff has been friendly and helpful. This trip was no different.  When we had problems with our Rental Car (no fault of MGM), the Concierge we spoke with went out of her way to help us!The MGM provides quality accommodations, great Customer Service and outstanding convenience to Las Vegas visitors. It continues to my first choice on my trips to Sin City!",1
"I really liked our experience.  Our salesman, Brad, never once pressured us.  We told him what we were looking for, he pointed out where they were and waited until we had questions. Every other furniture store we had gone to that day the sales staff hovered, pushed, pressured and wouldn't leave us alone.  And when we didn't like the product, they would try to get us to sit on it again and try it again.  I'm sorry, but I know if it isn't what I'm looking for. I don't need someone who doesn't know how we live or what we like telling me something that sucks is great.The store had Despicable Me playing on multiple televisions and my daughter was just in heaven. She could help us pick a sectional and still watch her movie.  Or she would stay at a display while we discussed an item and she was only a few feet away where we could watch her the whole time.  Genius, Mor!!! Absolutely genius.We left happy, and unlike other experiences I have yet to feel an ounce of buyers remorse.  The delivery for the sectional went quickly, smoothly, and at the time they said.  And the product is exactly what we saw in the store.  It looks great and I really feel like it will last us for years.",1
Great food and service. The desserts were particularly good. The gyros and pizza are both good.,1
"I was so incredibly happy with everything at this hotel. It surpassed my expectations! We stayed there the weekend of a Tough Mudder weekend. The cost was competitive with other places to stay in the area & it was close to the event. It was right on the lake and looked beautiful both inside and out. Customer service was great from check-in to check-out. Everyone was very friendly. We were blown away by our room. When we first walked in I actually had to question my boyfriend and asked if he paid for an upgraded room lol. He said no it was just the basic room with a king bed. It had both a shower and a tub, double sinks, and clean toilet area. I also appreciated that they had an actual hair dryer with power instead of the typical mini hairdryer that's mounted on the wall like a lot of hotels use. The towels were super plush and good quality. They also had robes too. They have coffee pots & complementary bottled water in the room. We had a nice view of the outside garden/patio area, where they also have a fire pit you can cozy up by. Overall great experience & I will definitely stay there in the future. It's nice to not always stay on the strip. I highly recommend this place!",1
"a little loud, but super dog friendly and wonderful drinks, plus the decor gives rustic vibes with wood accents. will def be back",1
"The Place to Be! I met my friends for a drink at The Yard House. It was super happening because there was a hockey game in town. From my last visit, I knew where I was going to spend my food calories: Truffle Fries. The Yard House's version of Truffle Fries is hard to beat. Shoe string fries are fried to perfection, then sprinkled with delicious Parmesan powder, other seasoning, parsley and a light drizzle of truffle oil. We enjoyed two orders. Our drinks were lovely. Martini, Yuzu with gin, and for me, I enjoyed an Angry Orchard Cider from the tap. Some parts of the restaurant were super noisy, but they put us in a quieter area in a booth. Our server, Stephanie was nice, but she was super busy. She apologized for the bar being slower because of the crowds. Good times!",1
"The Triple George Grill is a great spot downtown, don't let the grill part throw you off. Decided to try as it came highly recommended by some friends. Everything from the ambience, to server, to food was executed with perfection.",1
"Wow, all four wisdom teeth out for my 14 year old daughter and 48 hours later, she is doing amazing. Swelling was gone yesterday, and she feels great. Can't thank them enough for an amazing job done and for having the courtesy to give contact info if needed!!! Thank you tremendously!!!!",1
Ingredients are fresh and they grow many of the spices and vegetables on the property. The pink leek sauce with pasta is a family favorite. Portobello mushroom stuffed with spaghetti squash is a wonderful vegan option. All of the pizzas are made with fresh dough and are delicious. It is BYOB and cash only. The owner is there daily and it's always a wonderful experience.,1
"I REALLY like this place. you can tell it is family owned and the family works here. Most importantly, the food was delicious. I had the ""Tacodilla"" with Carne Asada and it was delicious. the restaurant is simple and authentic. I will be back.",1
Hole in a wall with good authentic Thai food.  Service was right on spot.  price is great.  will come back when we are in the area.,1
"Nothing is more refreshing than a Stay-cation at the MGM's Skyloft boutique hotel (unless you're staying at the Mansion in MGM). The rooms and views are breathtaking, and the service is nothing but the best. You'll be greeted with warm friendly smiles everywhere you go, the suites are fully stocked to for entertaining , and the staff will do anything to make your stay the best. They will book all your reservations, bring you your morning Starbucks, and the kitchen will even make custom meals for you that are not on the menu. This is the perfect place to go if you want ultimate relaxation without lifting a finger...",1
"being training with Jaydon D. he is very knowledgeable and his work outs are always challenging he has give me a good set of foundations to continue my training, for personal reasons i can not continue to pay for his services but i would highly recommend having him as your personal trainer",1
"Wow that's all I can say! Very fast service,great food and very good customer experience. Would definitely recommend to others and will return soon and try other menu items.",1
"Just moved into town from New Orleans and was hurting for immaculate cocktails and this place kills it. Love the drinks, food, atmosphere and service. I can't recommend this place enough!",1
"Discovered this gem of a restaurant as it is walking distance from my house, and wanted to try a different Sushi restaurant. It is a small location, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Less people means quicker service and better quality service!The owners greeted us and were very pleasant and attentive the entire time we were there. We placed our All-you-can-eat order and they brought it within no time at all, and altogether (instead of item by item like most places). They even brought us some additional rolls for us to try out and see if we liked them. After we were done with sushi we ordered dessert and the waitress suggested a few items (that weren't on the menu) such as sesame chocolate-filled dough balls which were really tasty.Overall, it was a fantastic place to dine at and has become my new favorite sushi restaurant. The service was extremely friendly and warm (which I find is oddly rare at Sushi restaurants lately). I even took a platter home for my family after we finished. Coming here from now on!",1
Dont try another gym. It doesnt get any better. $53/mo fir my family. Towel and free guests part of membership.,1
Great place to eat I'd you're visiting Downtown Las Vegas.  They serve the best veggie beef soup ever.  I love the hit sandwiches too!  Its a quiet and intimate setting which is nice!,1
Great tap brews particularly of German background but has something for every beer lover. Food was high end pub food. I would go back.,1
Saw this place from the road and said that I would come back to try it one day  Decided to try it today and wow was I impressed! The customer service from the man at the counter was out standing! He was very courteous and welcoming to me. That's very important to me. Also I ordered the 3 piece chicken combo and a watermelon smoothie. It was all just wonderful.  I will be back and highly recommend.,1
"I can't say enough good things about this studio.  The teachers are truly talented and do a great job breaking down a dance move into easy to understand concepts for younger dancers.  The teachers are patient and do a great job managing the kids in class.  My two daughters participated in hip hop and I would highly recommend these classes to anyone.  It provides all kids with more self confidence while burning some energy.  There are many other types of dance classes available too.I don't have a son, but this studio is very popular with boys.  If your son has an interested in hip hop, this is your place!  Fun, creative, and hip.  The year end recital cannot be missed.  There are many talented dancers as well as the performance by Team.  All dances and music are age appropriate and I never once questioned their music selection.  The Overture Center provides a wonderful setting for the performance.I love this studio!",1
"We had excellent service each time we dined at IHOP while in town. We were greeted and sat quickly. Our orders were taken promptly and our food came reasonably quick. Their new Blackberry Vanilla double dipped brioche french toast tastes amazing, might I add! Good value, service and food!",1
"I bought a used 02 Miata and after extensive research found Mike to be the only one to take a Miata too in Phoenix. I took the car to him and had his guys look it over and WOW! Treated my car like it was his own and shared a TON of useful information on how to care for it. Sorry your closing soon, I would have been a life long customer!",1
"Great used books, with lots of depth in business, teen fiction, recipes, classics. Basically, whatever I was looking for, there were many options. Helpful staff. And they buy books too.",1
"I went in to Ashley Furniture and I was greeted by Donna Archangel in new just what I wanted and I told her my vision we walked right around the corner and she showed me exactly what I said she was right on point. I told her ill take it all was good. Then the furniture was going to be delivered the day before Thanksgiving lol. I gave all my other furniture away just waiting for the new furniture. i had 13 people coming for Thanksgiving and no furniture. the new furniture came looked at the furniture it was the wrong color i thought, so I sent it back . Donna called me and said what's going on? I told her the furniture was the wrong color she told me please come down and let's see what we can do.

AwEsOmE!1. Mobile Massage comes to you!!    RV with a massage table/spa room2. Scheduling was quick & easy on-line   Even make your payment on-line3. Massage was GREATZane's massage are not your usual massage. It's like a cross between a Chiropractor & Massage. He moves your limbs while he gives you the massage which helps get all those tough spots.,1
"Really enjoyed this off shoot of the PHX Barrio.    Great tequila selection that was at first a lot to comprehend but my server Karen guided me through with ease.   Excellent selection of tacos from ""al pastor"" to ""salmon y arrachera""  - my favorite.   Highly recommend and I'm a native - i've eaten a billion tacos.  Sit in Karen's section if you want to navigate all the highlights this place offers - she's awesome.   The location has been many things and I hope and believe this one will stick.   Cheers to you Barrio Queen.",1
"Nice restaurant with a good variety of options (vegetarian, seafood, etc.) for most dietary restrictions or preferences. They offer large portions and have friendly service. Great place in Brampton; high value for the cost.Restaurant is clean, spacious, and bright. Pretty casual atmosphere.",1
Best indoor service! Vanessa and Miranda are sweetie! Drive thru is always busy! Go after 1 pm and it quiets down,1
"Super awesome lunch specials!  Huge portions, very good food.  Most of us got the lunch specials and they were very yummy with lots of food - salad, miso, rice, tempura and an entree!  Yes, AND an entree.  One of us got the teriyaki bowl and it was huge for the price.  Great service and we were back to the office in an hour.  We will be back!",1
"Love this spot! It gets quite busy so time is needed to stand in line but the bagels are worth it. There aren't any fancy gourmet options like Einstein's but that's what I like abt this place. The bagels are traditional, fresh and fluffy good! Desserts are from the east coast and that coffee cake!  The staff is quite friendly and prices are def reasonable ;)",1
"After driving past countless times, my children and I had breakfast here this morning.  We were quickly seated despite it being a Sunday and had a fantastic breakfast.  Clearly the menu caters to the health conscious with plenty of room for those seeking a more traditional breakfast.  The Morning Meditation juice was incredible and shouldn't be missed (a single serving would be good to share with another).  Don't miss this place!",1
"My boyfriend and I live in uptown and decided to go shopping for the day at Concord Mills, we ended up in Huntersville at Three Amigos. It was phenomenal! Our server, Katie, was amazing! Super nice, attentive and made us feel like we were at home. It was my boyfriends birthday so they sent out a desert on the house for us to celebrate. We have never been more satisfied with a place we ""accidentally"" ended up visiting. We will definitely be going back! Dating a chef makes going out to eat somewhat difficult but Three Amigos left him with nothing but good things to say! The couple next to us mentioned that they go three times a week! And we now know why, everything was delicious. You can really taste that their food is fresh and made with attention. Definitely a place to try!",1
"I discovered this place last year wandering around in Old Montreal. It seemed cute and cozy, and very reasonably priced. I've been here twice so far, and each experience was the same: more than reasonable portions of delicious food. First time was for brunch (4/11), second for dinner (2/12).The brunch option came with many things.. scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries, baked beans, bread, an assortment of fresh fruit (including pineapple, kiwi, watermelon and blackberries- swoon!) with my choice of juice AND coffee or tea. Everything was cooked well, delicious and satisfying. When ordering tea, you receive a carafe of hot water with your cup, along with your choice of teas from a box they bring right to the table.My more current dinner stop was with the boy. I went with the table d'hôte option, while he ordered à la carte. My menu included soup, entree, and dessert plus hot beverage for 16$. I chose the vegetable cream soup, which was a lot like split pea. The soup was average, but did the job of warming me up from being outside in the snowy weather all afternoon. For entrees, I had the chicken pot pie and M tried the croque-monsieur. Both were delicious and came with generous side salads. The crust on my pot pie was flaky and buttery, and the filling was by no means overseasoned. I'm not normally a ham person, but the bite of M's sandwich also tasted delicious. For dessert, my menu included a triple chocolate cake, with tea. Again- cup, carafe and the large box of teas. M ordered a chocolate mousse cake which was rich without being overindulgent.The best part about this place is the atmosphere. While small and cozy, I didn't feel cramped. I have never felt rushed, and the service was attentive and polite. I will definitely be coming back on future trips to Montreal.",1
"I stopped in because I'm traveling, and I forgot my tweezers. I figured I would try out threading. Found a great deal on Groupon for this place. Harita was very warm and welcoming. She thoroughly explained the process and how it works. If I lived in Vegas, I would make this place my brow place.",1
"This restaurant is a hidden gem! Great food, and great service! Rosie's is always a better choice then the chain restaurants in the area! Definitely a must try!",1
"For my recent birthday (April 5 - mark your calendars for next year!), I originally made reservations for Rosemary's. However, a few hours prior, I decided that I couldn't go to Vegas without visiting HB. I'm soooo glad that I made this last-minute change of plans!The band playing that night was awesome! They played oldies and even the Star-Spangled banner. Sadly, I only had the 1/2 liter of beer, while my boyfriend had two 1-liters. If you come here, definitely order the pretzel. It's humongous! It was so good that it was gone before I could take a picture. Our server spanked me with a wooden paddle. She just got hired a week ago. Man, she must love her job. HB - I'll see ya when I'm back in town! Luv ya!",1
"This place never ceases to amaze me. The food is delicious and so are their craft cocktails.Just a few tips - 1. Since their portions are smaller, they're definitely worth sharing.2. Sit on the patio when the weather cools down, it's magical.",1
I'm giving Paul 5 stars even though he didn't repair my washer. I called him and told him what was going on. He said the timer was shot. He had to look up the part and called me within an hour with an estimate. I was torn between having it fixed or buying a new washer. Paul said he'd hate to see me put money into my old washer since it was about 15 yrs old just to have it go out soon after. I bought a new washer. Nice guy and very honest! I wish he also fixed cars and plumbing! I'll call him again if I ever have another washer or dryer problem.,1
"I just came from there and has such a fabulous experience that I had to sit down ASAP and write about it. A friend and I had taken our little ones to the Discovery Children's Museum. I had suggested we hit this candy shop afterward, as another friend had posted a pic on FB of gummy chicken feet she had found there. :)  I was intrigued enough by gummy chicken feet that I had to check this place out. Plus, we love candy stores. We've been known to drive all the way into Boulder City just to visit Grandma Daisy's and we used to frequent Rocket Fizz on the west side of town before they disappeared.Anyway, Sweet Spot...beyond awesome! We walked in and no one else was there. The first thing that hit me was that it just looked...pristine! Many times candy shops look cluttered and feel cramped. Sweet Spot is small but the atmosphere was just perfect. I loved it the second i walked in. The second thing I noticed...it was like they had just been there waiting for us specifically. The two dudes there were so welcoming and friendly. They let us sample the candies. I sampled so much of the chocolate that I haven't even felt the need to open the chocolate I bought. And it is GOOD chocolate. The assortment of gummies was so awesome and they had some I'd never seen anywhere else, like the chicken feet and fried eggs. One of the guys took our kids out onto the front sidewalk to play hopscotch while we finished with our purchases. It was great. It was seriously like visiting friends or someone we'd known forever. We felt that welcome. On the drive home we asked the kids if they liked the candy store. Both of them said yes and were raving about getting to play hopscotch. Something so simple and it completely made their entire day. I've lived in Vegas since 2007 and I can honestly say Sweet Spot is one of my top five favorite places. I'm big on customer service and when I walk away with a happy kid and feeling like i just left friends, then you are doing something right. We will be back!",1
This is one of the best cajun restaurants in the area. Red beans and rice are perfect.,1
"Worth the DriveI was always curious and wanted to stop by and see for myself why Butterfields Pancake House draws such a large crowd. After visiting Butterfields a few times I had my answer, the food is delicious. In fact, everything is delicious in this bustling, get em in, get em out, breakfast spot.Anyone who has ever dined at Butterfields boast about the pancakes and for good reason. These pancakes are everything a pancake should be, light, fluffy, golden brown,  and very tasty.  Butterfields serves their pancakes with pure maple syrup and pancakes, come with most entrée's on the menu.However, pancakes, arent the only entrees that taste great.  The other breakfast items Butterfields serves up are delicious as well. I really enjoyed the Santa Fe skillet. The chorizo is well seasoned but not overpowering, the onions & avocados are fresh, and the bed of hashbrowns are perfectly crispy.My lunch companion decided to try  the ""create your own omelette"".  The omelette was large, fluffy, and filled with sausage, mushrooms, and cheese. My lunch companion said, it was the fluffiest and best tasting omelette he's had in a long time.  We both decided to order orange juice with our meal, which at Butterfields is fresh squeezed and delicious. The servers are helpful and careful to accommodate your needs.  Butterfields is worth the wait.  I am  interested in going back to try their lunch fare.",1
This restaurant is amazing.  Beautiful decor and the service is wonderful.  Has the prime rib dinner for $50.....   I think it was 3 courses and delicious.  Well worth the money and lots to take home.   The full size dessert (lava cake) was out of this world.Update.  Came here for my BF's birthday. We had the Tomahawk Tuesday dinner -$130.  Amazing!!!   See pics  Also wanted to mention that the drinks were also delicious.,1
Came back again to buy a truck that we both can use especially my husband.  We bought a used truck.  We used John again!  He is very knowledable and patient with us since it was the two of us and a 9 year old daughter. The original car we wanted was sold which was frustrating.  John had the inventory list with him and we took time to figure out what would work for us and our needs.  I was very happy with the service we received.  We will always support Ford Country.,1
"My husband and I loved this restaurant so much that we had a late lunch here two days in a row.  Luckily we had the same waiter who was awesome and very low key in a good way.The first afternoon we decided to order three tapas each.stuffed dates: fried and stuffed with bacon and almond.  The pepper sauce was smokey with a small kick.  These little nuggets were polished off in probably 30 seconds, they were just that good!calamari a la plancha: baby squid.  Extremely tender with a great lemon bite.  Probably the best calamari I have ever had.  Not one single piece was chewy.ahi tuna tempura: Two pieces of ahi tempura battered and fried. The ahi was still rare which was nice. Probably my least favorite dish if only because I have had different versions of this dish at Japanese restaurants.  However, I really dug the wasabi foam.molecular tuna raspberry skewer:  We had to order one of the ""molecular"" tapas just because off all the talk on yelp.  I kind of liked it but then again it was  nothing too special.  Sort of weird to eat a somewhat fishy/fruity jello.  Still not that bad.huevos estrellados:  This dish was crazy insane good.  Perfectly cooked eggs on top of amazingly tasty potatoes and bite size pieces of chorizo.  The best cooked eggs that I have ever had besides my Noni's.  The flavor in this dish is beyond good.  Perfect seasoning. Not runny or oily, just amazing. golden and red beet salad: Great beet salad.  Nothing overpowering about this dish which made it a perfect.  Love the citrus squares.Lastly we had to order dessert.  We settled on a arroz con leche and it was one of the tastiest versions of rice pudding that I have had.  Great citrus flavor.  Loved it.The next day we basically decided on ordering a paella and two tapas.Stuffed dates: Had them the day before and still amazing on the second day.Sauteed Padron peppers: A nice big plate of salty, crucnchy, and downright yummy peppers.  Loved these and they , along with the dates, are on the to order again list.For Paella we decided on the Valenciana which had rabbit, chicken, and veggies.  So glad that we came back a second day for the paella.  The rabbit was tender as well as the chicken and there was a perfect balance of saltiness. The rice around the edge of the pan was crunchy and very tasty.No dessert on this visit as we forced ourselves to finish the whole paella which was definitely pushing it.  We were stuffed.We had a great experience at the restaurant.  Food was fantastic and so was our waiter.  We will definitely be back on our next trip.",1
Three of us tried two cupcakes and they were delicious. Creamy - not too sweet icing and moist chocolate and carrot cake. The person serving us was polite and helpful in making choices.,1
"After leaving Bloom Salon next door to this place followed by a quick trip to the   then Verizon store on the end of the strip, I  noticed two women coming out of the restaurant with carryout boxes. From the sidewalk outside it's hard to tell that  there is a restaurant there.  Craning my neck, I looked up and saw the sign. The women said they liked it .So what the heck. I went in to grab a menu. I was met with an sit-down-and-order-now aroma coming from the kitchen. Behind the strip mall blandness and the busy road noise outside this place is a cool inviting sanctuary. The bar is nice as well. This is a Korean-owned restaurant and right away I though of those wonderful Korean spare ribs. But when I saw Calamari  on the Teppan menu I had to order it.  It was the best calamari I've ever had; big chunks of meat grilled with crisp edges and a tender interior.  The diner came with a broth soup (one of the best I've tasted) and the salad was excellent. These people really have seasoning down to an art.",1
"I've come and gone elsewhere... and I'm back!!  We have all tried other spots, to see if the grass is greener, but it isn't!! Sure at times some of the girls can be moody... but who isn't!?! I'm giving 5 stars based on quality, service, price, cleanliness and selection of polish's all of which are excellent!!!",1
"Choice espresso coffee here folks!Delicate crema, deep roasted and full bodied. These guys have selected a delightful roast and are super particular about the freshness and feel of the brew.Great atmosphere, friendly service, home made treats and all at very realistic prices.Well worth the trip",1
"Went with two of my friends and absolutely loved the food, drinks, and atmosphere. The cookies are amazing. Definitively going to go again.",1
"I purchased the groupon, and had no problem setting up appointments. I am having my stomach area done. After 3 treatments I purchased another 12 session for my legs. I am very happy with the service and results. I have found Kim to be very accommodating to my requests. They have 2 offices in the same building. This is not a magical process that makes you drop 10 pounds after every visits. I have noticed reduced inches, fading of stretchmarks and cellulite smoothing, It's definitely worth it!",1
"We were looking for a lunch place and my phone app suggested this place, I couldn't be more in love with my phone for suggesting it. It is a very small an unassuming place on the outside and you would miss it if you weren't looking for it. The wait staff was very friendly and very informative, our waitress made sure to ask if it was our first time and answered any questions we had. The food was amazing! I would put down what we had, but I think you should go in not knowing and have an amazing experience like we had. I will definitely be back for more!!",1
"Janair is the sweetest! She cut my hair better than I could have expected, my curls work so well now.  I don't know if I have ever had a compliment on my hair before, but I have been getting A LOT lately! Also, I REALLLY enjoyed my time visiting with her.  She was as nice as can be! I admire her and what she puts out there through her work.  I left uplifted!",1
Loved the Trash Can Nachos!!!! Superceded all of my expectations. Absolutely mouthwatering ! And the Draughts were crisp and fresh!,1
"We're up from Cincinnati and while shopping, opted to stop at Taki's. The reviews looked solid and we hadn't had good Greek food for years. (Cincinnati isn't exactly your hot bed of fine ethnic food.) Taki's didn't disappoint. The calamari was excellent. The lamb shank fell off the bone and was awesome. I had the flat iron steak which was very good. We'll be back for sure the next time we travel to the Cleveland area.  And we'll leave room for dessert!!",1
"YELPERS have this one right.  Best Korean restaurant in Cleveland.  All the other restaurants have issues but Seoul Garden is about as authentic as you're going to get if you enjoy typical Korean dishes (soups and rice dishes).  If you want K-BBQ it's average but you're not going to get great K-BBQ in Cleveland.  Service is  excellent and the hot tea is brewed perfectly and side dishes are above average.  Again, this is Cleveland people...not Cali.  I had the Rick cake soup and it was rock solid.  Broth was a consistent bone taste vs watery like most restaurants.  Dumpling was Store bought but certainly tasty.  The meat was sliced in strips and very tasty (very little fat).  I've been to South Korea and the Rick cake soup here is almost as good as Seoul.  Now go get some healthy soup for your soul!",1
Homer Simpson would love this place!,1
"Our first day in Canada we arrived hungry! We chose this restaurant because it was close to our hotel and had good reviews. This is a family owned and run business. The chef is a 5 star chef who decided to stop traveling so much and start a family Vietnamese restaurant. Don't be deceived by the storefront in the industrial neighborhood. The minute you walk in you are met by friendly service, elegant music, and calming decor. The waiter helped give us suggestions. Loved the mango salad on rice, spring and egg rolls were fresh and yummy with crisp peanut dipping sauce. Chicken and shrimp pad Thai was a little spicy for my 11 year old but no worries, both my boys filled up on rolls and salad....so more food for me and my husband! I had the meat Pho bowl with side of veggies to put in. The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth and my four year old ate all the meatballs. Loved the fresh flavors of the broth...I'm thinking ginger. For beverages we drank the hot tea they brought and also treated ourselves to a drip coffee, with condensed milk, poured over ice. Thankful for our experience here!",1
"Eric was AMAZING, the breakfast was unbelievable. We had the lemon ricotta and strawberry oatmeal pancakes and the wet burrito.Super super super!",1
"I really liked the work, the place, and the people.  Looking forward to a pedicure next! :-) happy happy happy",1
"Came here with a group of 4 on a Wednesday night after work. We had reservations so getting a table wasn't an issue, but it did fill up pretty quickly.  Really nice decor, good vibe.Had the Manti dumplings (amazing), Guernsey girl cheese (really good), duck kibbeh (good but i would get land ribs over these), lebneh (ok, it is what it is), fig salad ( really good), yogurt fluke (amazing), lamb's leg really good, a lot of food),  hand rolled could cous (so good), seared cauliflower, and oxtail basmati (so good).  This was a lot of food for the 4 of us but it was all really good. The Manti dumplings and fluke are must tries.  The lamb was huge so maybe ask your server about the portion size when ordering. I really loved the food here. Would highly recommend.",1
"Am a big fan of Trader Joe's and only wish there was one closer to Huntersville.  We generally hit this location although I sometimes head to the Uptown one before leaving work for home. I really enjoy many of their pre-packaged meals.  The Mandarin Orange Chicken is good, much cheaper and just as good as what you would get at many Chinese restaurants.  Other favorites are the French Onion soup and Carmelized Onion Dip.  With the dip, I recommend buying two because one will not last you long enough!  We ran out Friday night and I'm feeling compelled to make the drive again today.  We also buy a bunch of the frozen fish items to have in the freezer for a quick blackened mahi or seared tuna steak dinner.  While obviously not fresh, have found the taste to be pretty good once prepared.Open one in Huntersville and you get 6 stars (at least in my mind)!",1
"I cannot day enough good things about this place. I finally tried it yesterday with a friend and we are obsessed! I consider myself a hummus connoisseur, have tried them all, made an occasional batch, but nothing compares to the Parallel truffle hummus I tried last night. It was to die for and the pillowy hot pita was the perfect thing to dip. We also got the falafel balls which were amazing! Our waiter explained to us all of the fresh herbs that go into them which explains why they were so green on the inside, plus they come on a beautiful bed of beet tahini. Our server was named Jeremy and he was amazing and so helpful. the environment was also stunning! We sat up top and the view was really cool. Can't wait to return ASAP, perhaps for some brunch",1
Absolutely delicious cocktails great wine list and the food is fantastic.  Country Chicken buttermilk sandwich is so tasty.  We sat outside.  Great ambiance.  I love this place and will definitely be back.,1
"What an awesome Vegas experience.  I'm in love with this thing!The ride at night-time is spectacular.  Pricey, but doesn't break the bank.  They have ticket kiosks right at the beginning of the Linq promenade, and the High Roller is at the very end.  Very handy.My group and I went at about 11:30 pm on a Tuesday night and there was hardly a line at both the kiosks and the actual High Roller itself.  They ushered us into the building and through ropes of lines but didn't have to wait longer than 30 seconds to actually get into the ride.  I'm sure on weekends or at different hours this is another story, but I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly we were on the ride.The actual observation room is very spacious and can fit a large amount of people. The ride itself lasts about 30 minutes and has a video commentary,  but not excessively loud, so you can still talk among you and your group.  The drinks at the High Roller are about the same price as any bar on the Strip, but the bartenders were nice and friendly and made the drinks very quickly.  I think the cups are novelty and you can take them after you're done, but I threw mine away in the midst of all the fun I was having :(This is a super awesome addition to the Strip and I'm so glad it's here.  It's a beautiful 30 minutes of gorgeous Las Vegas scenery and a relaxing ride.",1
"So I've been getting my nails and feet done for 17+ years, Modern nails is definitively top 2 ... Walking in,  I noticed it's super clean and NO smell ... The owner Mai is very friendly and informative,  I can tell she knows what she's doing ... All and all the whole staff is very friendly,  nice people.  I look forward to being a regular there ... Ladies,  fyi is open till 11pm, appointments after 7pm !!!! A super plus for ladies in the industry !!!",1
My favorite hotel on the strip! Basically centrally located on the strip so it is nice if you are club/casino hopping up and down LV Blvd.,1
"Wonderful company to do business with!  We had a call back immediately after requesting a quote.  They patched and painted our garage, we also had them paint our daughters 4 bedroom house.  The pricing was very reasonable and the work was outstanding.  They finished our garage in two days and my daughters home in three.  We will definitely use them again.",1
"I can't stop thinking about the Nashville hot chicken, sweet and spicy and highly addictive.",1
Ive been going to Doggie Den for the last 10 years with all my dogs and I absolutely love it! They have great service and are very time efficient with getting the job done. My kids are always coming out so fresh and clean. With cute bows for my girl and a lovely bandana for my handsome. The prices are great for the work that they do. Don't go to Pet Smart! Come to Doggie Den for your bucks worth!,1
Straight flamas. My boy Waylon was a wizard with his ice cream sorcery. The boba was great and it's literally right next to a sushi place. They roll ice cream better than y'all do blunts,1
This place is a gem. The service was perfect. The food was delicious (I'm still dreaming of the brussel hash). I would love to see a cafe like this in my neighborhood in NYC!,1
"Stayed here this past weekend for the first time. It was an absolutely amazing experience! I heard so many great reviews and my bf's sister and her husband stayed here once and we got to see their rooms. The rooms at the trump are fantastical! My group of 3 just got the regular room but I believe it was still larger than most typical rooms on the strip! The room was spacious, clean, and there was plenty of closet/storage space! The bed was the BEST bed I've ever slept in! SOO COMFY! I just wanted to sleep all day and all night! but, who goes to vegas to do that?! lol! Another plus was the sofa was a pull out couch, so my friend got his own bed as well. The bathroom is awesome too! I have a thing about small shower stalls but this one was great! Enough room to move around and not touch any walls, which i like! There is also a very large tub/jacuzzi which I unfortunately didnt get the chance to try out. I will definitely go in it next time around though! Like all the other reviews mentioned, there is a tv implemented into the mirror. It was Its not a new thing haha. The service at the hotel is great, too. The check-in line wasnt too long and the lady that helped me was really friendly. She tried to offer an upgrade for 40 bucks to a one bedroom suite but I didnt  take it. Valet and the door man service were excellent too. Each time I brought my car up, there was someone to take down my information right away. The first night there, we tried to hook up our ipods to the iLove they provide in the room, but it was broken. We called the front desk and they quickly sent someone up to replace it. The only downfall I encountered was that both nights I stayed there, I tried to ask room service for an extra blanket for my friend on the pull out couch. Both nights they ran out of blankets. Really? They ran out? Weird. But oh well. They did provide us with the regular sheets though.",1
"Happy hour is great - both cocktails and appetizers are good, even the skinny cocktails.  And I LOVE angry edamame!  My girlfriend saw that I posted I was at Kona grill on my b-day (tagged on fb) and she phoned in and ordered my girlfriends and i a round of drinks at our table - how cool is that???  The waitress needed her managers help b/c officially they were not supposed to do it (my friend had to text a photo of herself with the signed card and her photo id) but they went to the extra trouble to make it happen on my birthday - what a sweet gesture!  they could've just stuck to the books and said sorry no-can-do, but instead they went the extra mile - great customer service!!",1
"This shop is my new go-to. I had issues with transmission light going on, car stalling and jerking. Also needed oil change. I took it in here because it was closest to me. But expecting to get screwed somehow because im female with an undriveable car.  Travis the manager was very professional and polite. Let me know what was going on and took it upon himself to call authorized jeep dealer when a trans problem was found to see if it was covered under powertrain warranty. Oil change was quick and service was great. Will be coming here again.",1
"My puppy and I had a sick day. So of course that means lets go get some icecream!I remembered Aloha Yogurt had a great Milkbone flavored Dogurt (Get it? thats cute. :) ) so we came here. Even though I came to spoil my puppy I was very very very happy with the unique flavor selection they had, and the toppings! The denseness and thickness of the yogurt was on point and that Oreo Brownie yogurt.. OH EM GEE! love love love.Next time I will need to try the coffee but if you are lookign for a palce that you can enjoy with your furry friend.. this is it. :)",1
5 stars is not enough. I would with out a doubt recommended Vegas Strong to anyone looking for high quality low pressure sales and installation. Ante and his crew are amazing. I started with one of the major companies that do HVAC and plumbing. They give away free flashlights and stuffed animals and also had us fearing that if we didn't replace a 21 year old furnace that we would basically risk carbon monoxide poisoning. The price they quoted for a new system was through the roof. I got estimates from two other companies one also high and one reasonable. I called Vegas Strong and Ante came to my house and gave me all the options of what we could do. I felt no pressure and felt like we were dealing with an honest experienced individual who was not trying to scare us into something we did not need. Ante beat the price of the lowest competitor and I couldn't be happier with the service provided. The Vegas Strong crew showed up at our home Saturday morning and did an amazing job on the installation. If you're looking for a new system or just a maintenance program on your current system I would highly recommend calling these guy's. Thank you Vegas Strong you have earned a customer for life.,1
Honestly every time I come here I always have an amazing experience. Everyone is so friendly. It is also clean and they do a good job!!!,1
"Archi's!!! I love you guys! Best thai food in vegas! Waiters are friendly, food is fast, thai tea is big, dishes are DELISH! I have been coming here with my family for years and they are still one of our favorites. Trust.I come here at least 2x a month for takeout. Takeout over the phone is quick and easy, food is ready within 20-25 min, and they are awesome!Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to try. It's very very very good.",1
"Didn't expect much when we decided to go here. I hadn't been to chili's in years and jokingly brought it up to the gf. This might be the best damn meal I've had this month. This place is awesome. 3 course meal for $25 for two people? Hell yes brother. Sever was awesome, food was awesome, and they had tv's at all angles. I SEE YOU CHILI'S. Coming here once a month at minimum.",1
Lee provided excellent service.   I ordered the beef burgundy pot pie.The outdoor seating is beautiful.The prices are good.,1
"Our experience at this race track was excellent. The staff is friendly, welcoming and superb. Highly recommend for anyone who wants a breathtaking rush of adrenaline  before heading back home.",1
"Who knew that stuffing my face with ice cream could help others?? Love the concept of partial ice cream profit proceeds going towards someone else's ""dream."" Why should Ben and Jerry make bank on ice cream flavors?Staff volunteer for their donation proceeds. Friendly folks and their ice cream.",1
Just the best meats around!!!! Highly recommended!! Value for sandwiches is unbeatable,1
Hubby and I brought our 2 year old granddaughter here for the day and we had so much fun! It wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be and the time seemed to fly by. She is still too young to go in the giant treehouse and playground by herself so Grandpa and Grandma certainly got a workout! They also have an area with video games and carnival type games like Skeeball where you can collect tickets for prizes. We were pleased to see that they didn't gouge you on food prices either. They seemed pretty reasonable. We will definitely return!,1
"Delicious thin crust pizza, and it's definitely a secret since there aren't any signs leading to it...just some random hallway and bam! you're inside Secret Pizza. But anyways, the toppings they offer are delicious. I got an all white pizza the day I came. I could probably eat their pizza all day long. GO!!! Prices are good, portions are great, and it's all quality.",1
"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time to eat this evening. We got 2 appetizers to start, the crab cakes and bacon sticks. Both were amazing!!! Then I ordered the strip steak special, it was cooked to a perfect rare temperature and was paired perfectly with a baked potatoes and vegetables!! My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich with the chipotle barbeque sauce paired with French fries, he said it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had and the fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned. We will definitely be returning in the future!!! Our experience was more enhanced by our server, Amanda. She was an amazing and attentive to server, always making sure we had everything we needed from start to finish!!! Thank you for a wonderful dining experience!!",1
Excellent food! Had outstanding service by Brittany. Must come when in Scottsdale for breakfast.,1
"My go-to place when I want a yummy salad. I know, who goes to a pizza place for salad.. First of all, it's really good and secondly, let me live haha I always get their Ahi poke chop salad and I split it with my girl each time. It is a pretty huge serving so you can actually split the salad between 2 people. They give you an ample amount of ahi tuna on top and they're pretty big chunks. The dressing is nice and light. Every time I've gone here, I've always had the best service. The waiters are always so nice and timely. I love eating here. And now that the weather has gotten warmer eating at the outside patio is really nice so you can soak up some sun while having your meal!",1
"I've tried so many bubble tea places, but this is definitely in my top three!Super friendly workers and they always give good recommendations!",1
"At the risk of sounding like I am giving a 'paid announcement' I will keep this brief.  These days I am all about Customer Service and of course product or service outcome.  Both were over-the-top.  My hair was done by Anthea Johnstone if anyone is looking for Civello's best kept secret!  I don't think my hair has EVER looked so good.  Each time I go it gets better if that's possible - right from the moment I walk into the Salon and until I leave am I treated with this incredible service.  Absolutely the highlight of my day as well as, I believe, a frontrunner in how business should be conducted.  Thank you Civello for making this such a great place and a flawless referral!",1
"Very glad to have this cafe right next to work. Hands down the best coffee in the area, and their lunch selection is perfect: simple, tasty, high quality. My go-to's : Caesar salad (always fresh ingredients, dressing is creamy, croutons always crisp!) , and the beef Havarti grilled cheese (country bread, gooey cheese, tasty pulled beef). No pictures of the food to post because I ate way too fast and forgot to snap a pic. Proof that it's good ! Decor is minimalist and cozy, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee makes you want to spend all day there. Highly recommend",1
I was very impressed with the salon; very clean and friendly service. I was more than pleased with my pedicure. Will definitely come back!,1
"I looked this place up before I came to Charlotte for a long weekend trip. I am a big animal lover and my boyfriend even has a an owl tattoo! When we got to the wildlife park, the raptor center was basically in the very very back. When we arrived, we walked in and spoke to a staff member that gave us a map and said we can take our time and go anyway we want. The pricing was $20 a ticket, which I thought was steep until I saw how many exhibits they had! I loved all the birds and even got one to flap its wings as I flapped my arms...and I didn't care how I looked doing it. The flapping bird, the bald eagles and the barred owls were our favorites, the barred owls even had a staff member in their habitat and were quite active which was cool to see!!! I would definitely go back again and spend more time there. Their gift shop had things from local artists, which we both thought was really cool since my boyfriend is an artist along with plushies and info on all the birds we saw. I highly recommend this place to anyone!!!",1
"Okay, it's 4am and you want something, greasy, fried, with meat and cheese, you want to stuff yourself silly just because you can and you don't want to spend more than...$8.  Where do you go?This place.It is packed, always.  But, the line moves quick, you can literally see all the food made by in right in front of you, including tortillas from scratch.They have lengua fries!?  I love lengua, and I love carne asada fries, but the only way I could think to make asada fries better would be to swap out lengua, and this place does it!  And!?  They are amazing.The tacos are super cheap and really really fresh, they have loads of drink choices as well as a huge variety of grilled Mexican goodies on request (jalapenos, onions, that sort of thing).Serious, for delicious, grubby, 24 hour mexican food, it doesn't get better than this.",1
Best local pub in Arizona. The owners (Jim & Vickie) are class acts all the way. The bartenders are always hustling with a smile on their faces.Have been there several times and always feel safe and welcomed. I am hoping this pub stays around for many years to come.,1
I love everyone here and the store is very easy to get around and I never have a problem finding help for anything. keep up the great work people!,1
"Dr. Mitchell is awesome, he is my ENT Dr and he is absolutely very detail oriented, great listener to what you have to say, he's friendly and I always appreciate his precious valuable time cause hes a busy doctor serving others as well but takes his time to hear your concerns. Karen his receptionist/MA is phenomenal with great pt. service and very kind but all his staff is beyond kind and incredible. I wouldn't change ENT Drs. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",1
"I was an Inspirador Bride last March. Now, that things have slowed down and I'm FINALLY done with my thank you notes, I can sit and write a review. I love Inspirador. The facility is fantastic, because it can serve as an ""all-in-one"" venue, but not be like a banquet hall. I really like the blend of concrete floors and exposed ceilings with the pretty crystal, soft fabrics, and wall of tealight candles. It's a place where traditional meets unconventional and does it well. I also liked that I was able to do everything from the ceremony to dinner and dancing there, because we had so many guests from out of town, and didn't want them driving all over Phoenix.My consultants, Cynthia and Andrea were hands-down amazing, and when I suddenly changed my mind with decor, Cynthia met with me and was able to help me come up with a scheme that was gorgeous. We used the all-inclusive package (but purchased our own alcohol), and were very happy with the total price. This is because you tell them what you want to spend on your day and they match you with vendors who fall within your price range.Overall, having my wedding at Inspirador was a very wise choice, plus...people are STILL telling me how beautiful the wedding was!",1
"LOVE this place!  I take my puppy, Castiel, there to see Nikki. She is an artist!  The shop is tidy, yet comfortable, with a variety of products. Their deluxe baked treats are awesome!  Make an appointment with Nikki, your pooch will thank you!",1
I have been a patient of Spectrum Dermatology for years. I have used several of the providers and each one has been knowlegable and helpful. Their approach is to listen first and to educate you. Recently I took both my teens for acne and they are thrilled with the results. My teens especially appreciated the assistance of Danielle before and after the appointment with the physician assistant. I recommend Spectrum for your dermatology needs.,1
"French cuisine at its finest!We began the night enjoying the elevator ride upto the restaurant. What a beautiful view. We were greeted, and immediately taken to our table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. The service was amazing, and we were very well taken care of. We tried so many wonderful things, and all were delicious. The main courses: rack of lamb, and beef Wellington were the favorites. We ordered sides, but the main course were delicious and the sides were not needed. It is pricey, but please keep in mind you are not just eating, you are part of a dining experience. Ride it, and enjoy.My goodness, what a wonderful experience to dine at the Effiel Tower restaurant. I hope to do it again soon.",1
Great new neighborhood restaurant! I've only eaten here once but was pleasantly surprised. Their beer selection is by far the best in town! I am excited for the weather to cool down so I can enjoy their great patio.,1
Timbers has been my spot since I turned 21. Miss the 35 cent wing Wednesday. Every time i come in here its poppin and always run into somebody I know. Cant ever go wrong with the wings fries.,1
"So had take the van here because I was trying to do an oil change myself on it but stupid Terrible Herbst freaking tightened the crap out of the oil drain plug bolt and I could not hand-loosen it with my ratchet. I ended up stripping the bolt head as the socket and wrench I used slipped through the corners. My buddy Bob, from the UNLV math office, recommended Jack & Sons and I knew I could trust him since he works on his own cars. I already had all the supplies to do an oil change so they simply charged me $25 to remove the plug and do the rest of the change. They used a vise grip which would've cost me $20 anyhow to buy and whole lot more frustration as I cannot lift the van very high. They also had it done in less than an hour and a half from when we dropped the van off, so it was totally worth it. I am bringing my other car back for work on brakes and some other stuff.",1
"Good food and great service. We came early on  Saturday to celebrate our twins' second birthday (with our four other kids). We arrived just the second they opened (11 am) they told us they don't do Teppanyaki at the table that early and when they saw our disappointment they changed their mind. They couldn't have been more accommodating and helpful. Our kids had a great show from an awesome and funny chef and the servers were attentive but not hovering.  Perfect experience, thank you for making this day so special for us.",1
The drinks are good and average price.  The place is stylish but it gets very crowded between the bar and wall where you have to go through to get to the bathroom.The bartenders are super nice and fun!  We love Nate!!,1
This pub/bar is great. The atmosphere is friendly and fun and it's at a great location. Drink prices are very fair and the food to pair With it is very delicious,1
"A little over a month ago I got my septum pierced by Danielle and she did an amazing job. There was a small wait of like 20 minutes (which in my eyes is a good thing) they were professional and very clean. Danielle took her time with the placement, walked me through each step even though I have had plenty of piercings in the past it is still nice to hear. It was completely painless and she was very quick. I think the thing that hurt the most was that the clamp was just uncomfortable but not really painful. She even switch out my nostril ring for me as well.I recommend this shop 100% and I will be going back to see her for any other piercings in the future!",1
"I like the re-branding that JCPenneys has done recenlty, like doing away with the weekly coupons, door busters, and offering merchandise at lower everyday prices (basically what it would had been with a coupon).$5 for a good quality plain t-shirt! I like that! (not like the crappy see-through ones at Old Navy for $9!)Another good thing that I like at this store is that it wasn't crazy busy like it used to be during the sales! I was actually able to shop in a quiet environment and check out quickly without a long ass line. No wait for a fitting room either! The cashiers were friendly at the two kiosks that I went to. Employees even greeted me as I walked around the store, they never did this before...unless they were talking to the person behind me?This location seems to have a much bigger selection than the JCPenneys in Goodyear (plus, the Goodyear location looks like a Kohl's inside). The JCPennys home store is located across the street, next to JoAnn's.They have a clean restroom too - thank goodness they remodeled it a few years ago (or it would had ended up being like the disgusting one at the former Mervyn's, now Forever21 store)...",1
"These folks are great. The groceries are fine but I really come for the little food stand in the back. Good quality, very reasonable prices, friendly even though it can be quite crowded weekends.",1
"Great Store. Thanks Dave, for your professional advice and HUGE help for getting the right Saxophone for my DAD.  Definitely will back again.",1
"Can't really complain about this spot.  Foods quick, yummy, and cheap.  The lady who mans the counter is ultra nice and very funny.  Shes not only fast on orders but never skips a beat with customers.  The establishment itself is a tiny little shack.  It's got a small seating area and is rough around the edges, but I think that's part of the desire to stop here.    This location has a bit of a different menu as well.  They offer fried rice, burgers, steak sandwiches, egg rolls, corn dogs, and it's all simple and delicious.  Obviously the wings are the main attraction for Long Wong's, but I think this locations diverse menu is what makes it stand out, and it's honestly my favorite one of the bunch.So if you're near mid-town Phoenix and are craving something yummy without breaking the bank, stop by and grub on!",1
"A great nordstrom, upholds vegas standards. Great selection, and great sister stores as well. If you don't find it here, you can find it at saks or maybe neimans. Sale season here is also very brutal, which is the half yearly womens, and shoes! Nordstrom's is also known for their no-nonsense return policy and (usually) impeccable customer service.",1
"This is definitely my favorite Cirque show. My second time seeing and I think it was even better than the first. I don't really consider myself a Beatles fan.. I enjoy their music. Well, some of their songs, but I never really go out of my way for them. However this show is awesome. So much fun! I love how Cirque subtly tells a story. That's always so much going on, but it's easy to follow it all. My favorite part are the female dancers that twirl through the sky. It's crazy they are hooked up to some kind of rotating bracket that gives them so much freedom and they can just easily twirl, somersault and spin through the air with no hindrance. Obviously, a slow about Beatles is going to have a lot of color. Very bright, energetic sets! My friend's favorite part was the VW bus. I enjoyed it too great concept with the bouncy, trampoline roof. They're a lot of talent in this show that's for sure!",1
"Favorite date night restaurant. The cocktails on tap are outstanding! Food and service are consistently top notch. Order the mussels, they're the best I've ever had. Also."", don't miss the bao buns. Plan to get here early or wait. It's 100% worth the wait. Walk next door to Brazwells or have a drink at the bar while you wait.",1
This is the best Sport Clips location I have been to. I have no problem trusting the first available stylist after my long history of solid hair cuts here. I just started taking both my sons there as well and they do a great job at making young kids feel comfortable. The online check in feature is a real game changer and upgrade to customer experience. Today I showed up about 30 minutes after I checked in online and was seen immediately. They do a great job here and I will definitely be back.,1
Pizza here made my night... Good people and great pizza. They can do anything you ask with a great attitude!,1
"We had great service at Sambalatte, and the cappuccino was spectacular. Perfectly silky. The Nutella latte was also delicious. It was nicely flavored without overpowering the expertly pulled espresso with the flavor or sweetness of the Nutella. (Fun fact: they use the actual Nutella spread in the latte, not flavored syrups.)",1
"Have been here twice. First time for drinks with friends from Canada! This time with just my husband and our son. We had lunch here and it was great! The girls working the bar and food prep are upbeat, personable and very helpful! We will be going back for sure!! Try everything!!",1
Jenn Kim is a hair goddess!!! I'm so in love my hair. She exceeded my expectations and I will never go to another hairstylist again she has me for life. I trust her enough to tell her to do what she wants and I'm sure anything she chooses would be  fire.,1
"I don't understand why the reviews of this bakery are so sensationalistic and rude. The owner is a character, but where is the harm in that? She was very nice to me. I didn't know what to get, and she suggested a poppy seed roll. It was  delcious, fresh and large. The price was reasonable, especially considering the prime location and how hard it is to find really good Central and Eastern European bakery in Montreal (Cheskie's has more selection, of course).Maybe the owner has reprimanded customers who take pictures because the end up in mocking reviews.I would also venture that she is curt with some customers because she runs a business on her own and is not entirely comfortable in English or French. If you want to try European pastries, give this place a shot.",1
"I was recommended Myler's by a friend a while ago. After wasting a lot of money in big-name shops, I decided to try out this family owned business. I've been taking my cars there since about 2008. A 1992 Honda Accord and after that one was gone, a Suzuki Grand Vitara 1999. They have proved to be loyal, honest and very responsible people. Steve, Lindy and Brian and the rest of the staff are very attentive and I have never felt I am been oversold or taken advantage of. Coming from Puerto Rico to live in the Midwest it was always a big concern for me to find reliable and genuinely honest people to trust and to go to with questions, expecting a truthful answer. Simply put, I recommend these folks!",1
"Who knew this would be my last dinner in Vegas thus far, and that I would end up getting wheelchaired back to my Venetian suite?!For starters, we were served a complimentary lobster-topped crostini.A light appetizer consisting of freshly chopped watermelon cubes topped with halloumi set the stage for the best yet to come.Dropped by for dinner when the hostesses mentioned a Halibut special: fresh halibut on top of lobster mash. The menu is not extensive, so it may not cater to some (or many) taste buds, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the most well-prepared halibut I've ever had. The dishes look simple, but I truly appreciate every bite, a subtle flavor that lingers on your palate the rest of the night. The complimentary white chocolates are icing on the cake.Do not come here hungry - you will not be stuffed. Come here when you want your taste buds satiated with an interesting take on seafood.",1
"Tried YaYa's Tacos out while they were up in Anthem.  I arrived just before they were closing up for the night and even though they were closing they made me some DELICIOUS quesadillas, cauliflower rice and beans....OH THE BEANS!  I highly recommend YaYa's Tacos to anyone that sees them out!  Thank you for being so accommodating.",1
"I will never stay in a different strip resort, if I can avoid it. I love this hotel. This was my first stay at the Aria and I can't say enough good things about it. My experience began when we mentioned off hand upon check in that we were on out honeymoon and the next thing we knew, they had upgraded our room to a junior suite (free). Shortly after arriving in the actual room, someone stopped by to drop off complimentary cakes and chocolate covered strawberries with a congratulatory note. They really went out of their way to make our stay special. The rooms are also extremely nice. Curtains that open and close by remote, excellent views, and very modern decor. I've seen some people complain about the AC, curtains, and water flow from the faucets. What these people don't seem grasp is that the Aria is one of the most (if not THE most) environmentally conscious resorts on the strip. They have numerous environmental certifications (look it up). These are a result of such room features as curtains that close automatically when you're not there, lights that turn off automatically of you leave them on, low water flow, and AC that adjusts when you are not in the room. I, for one, feel great about staying in a place that feels luxurious but makes every effort to be energy and water efficient. The pool is also excellent. It's low key (doesn't have that ""spring break"" vibe), plays some great music throughout the day, isn't terribly crowded, and offers plenty of shade for those looking to stay out of the sun. It was one of the reasons we chose to stay here. I love this hotel. Is is more expensive than some of the other southern strip resorts, but well worth the extra cost. Give it a try.",1
Ok I'm updating this review.  I wrote one 18 months ago about the gaming bar area.  I now go to school next door during the day.  I walk over once a week and Ronika is ALWAYS my server.  She's so friendly and her hair and make up are always perfect!  She takes a lot of pride in her appearance.  This girl is an amazing server and I almost wanna shake her and tell her how she should be on the strip working cause she's a 10 and so soft and kind!  And thank u so much.   I've been being to write this but today when 5 girls from class and myself walked over she remembered from my last time I had the INDI card and just automatically discounted me.   Thank u girl!  PS:  get the Ruben and Onion Rings!,1
"This place is definitely a gem out here in surprise! The staff is always great, the prices are good and unlike most bars the food is actually top notch! You really can't ask for more. I recommend you give this place a try for some good Irish grub. They also have pool tables and plenty of TVs to catch some sports if you just want to kind of hang out at the bar. Love this place",1
"Local joint for the students to find great happy deals and bargains on drinks/grub. This was a very fun place, super convenient location and good ambiance.",1
I absolutely love to eat here. It is close to my neighborhood and is actually  pretty clean. The girl in the front is always very friendly and the food is super tasty. There is a lot of variety  and I as a cook myself do recommend this place to anyone that has a craving for sushi or chinese!!!,1
The best day club we experienced during our Fourth of July Weekend! So many hot bodies and the best music. Going through security was a breeze and the guest list wad free before 1PM. No room to put your stuff and $50 lockers were ridiculous but I would come here again!,1
"This was my go-to place before I moved out the the neighbourhood and had a child.  My husband and I were here probably far more often than we should have been - now it's a rare treat.  The atmosphere is great, it's small and cozy.  Great list of beer and the STAFF are amazing.  So friendly and unpretentious, unlike a lot of the other bars along the ""Assington"" strip.   Oh, also best nachos in Toronto!  The food here is REALLY good - an unexpected surprise.  One warning, and it's totally not the fault of the bar - it CAN get a tad douchey on a Friday or Saturday night.",1
"My wife and I have been going to Michael's since I bought her wedding ring in 2009.  Since then, we've referred every friend and relative to Eric Shelton over there.  He's the nicest and most knowledgeable jeweler I've ever encountered.  He always takes the time to understand our needs, and uses his expertise to make our buying experience wonderful.  Overall, I've received great service and great value at Michael's.  I will continue to go there and refer everyone I know to Michael's as long as Eric's around!",1
"Going back for sure. Food, service & atmosphere was very good. It was our first time there & everyone was so nice. Drunken Noodles hit the spot.",1
"I have to say that Eric is about as spot-on as it gets.I don't really like fried chicken with bones either.  I'm a breast (no bones) man myself.  But I love me some Price's chicken.  That's how good it is.  There's nothing quite like forcing yourself into that mass of humanity and coming out with a greasy box of chicken (and fixin's) and running through the meadow to your family in Freedom Park and digging in.  Unfortunately there seems to be less chicken in the box when you arrive at the park than when you left.  I don't understand how that works.Nonetheless - it's greasy.  That's what makes it good.  Deal with it.The Coop doesn't close at any particular time, no matter what anyone says.  They close when the chicken runs out, so if you want chicken, you get there early.In other words, don't get your underwear in a bunch to get there just before the doors close, because there is a very good chance that it's all going to be gone.  These people have been doing their job for a long time - they aren't going to run out right at closing time.  That's when they go home.  That means everything is shut down and cleaned up then.  The chicken will have been long gone by then.On the process - it's like the Soup Nazi, without the need to stand in line and move two steps to the left.  It's more like a somewhat-controlled mob.  Have your cash ready and when you get to the counter, place your order.  If you get to the counter and don't have your order, be prepared for someone else to take your place.  And don't go getting upset, okay?  You've now been warned.",1
"I am not a huge mustard fan so keep that in mind.  But this is by far the best mustard available.  You might think there couldn't be a big difference between Bertman's Ball Park Mustard and Stadium Mustard but they are world's apart.  Promise.  Check it out, I personally love it on Burgers just as much as hotdogs but you can use it anywhere you like brown mustard.",1
"Decided to visit this place because a friend of mine just started working here, Kristin, she alone is worth a visit to this place. Kristin has such an upbeat personality and a beautiful smile, make sure you ask her when you go and tell her Amber sent ya !!The restaurant has a huge patio facing Central Ave and the inside is decorated very tastefully. They have a nice selection of wines, specialty cocktails, and beer ( mostly Asian imports ). My husband and I ordered :The Temple of the Thaiger- delicious and described as a party in your mouth, and it was. Perfectly seasoned chicken layered on fried won tons.Satay Sampler- This was shrimp, chicken, and beef covered in a peanut sauce and was very yummy.Freshie Rolls- we had the chicken and the veggie and both were soooooo good, this is a must try !Jasmine rice- steamed to perfection.All food is made to order and is fresh and delicious. This is a family owned and operated business with Thai born chefs that really know what they're doing. It is a little pricey for Thai food, but the quality and flavor make it worth it. They also have several lunch specials for $7.95 from 11-2 Monday thru Friday.",1
The massage was excellent. You get to choose from a deep tissue massage with hot stones for just $30 an hour or a foot massage for $20. That's the same price as breakfast on the strip. I highly recommend this place and it's a short ride about 10 mins to and from the strip.,1
I popped in randomly after losing the case for my contacts. They gave me a starter pack of solution and a case. Super friendly and very helpful!,1
"Okay, I am a Marriott fan, and used to great Marriott service. Meeting the family in Scottsdale for Thanksgiving, 6 of us, so we had 2 two bedroom suites. Solid hotel, not the Ritz, but perfect for the six of us. Great Marriott service, clean and efficient and quite reasonable with breakfast and coffee throughout the day included. In a nice convenient area of Scottsdale, many attractions and dining choices close by. As always, besides cleanliness, superior customer service and pleasant staff such as Kim and all at the front desk were great representatives of superb customer service, kudos to the breakfast staff and housekeeping staff, top notch even giving up their own Thanksgiving to take care of the guests.  Marriott is a solid brand, and this economical choice of the brand does not disappoint, will be back!",1
"I have a standing nail appointment every two weeks.  This place takes care of me and literally opens early just so I can keep my appointments.My girl is V - and she is so thorough, she will not let me go until she examines my nails for perfection.  I know this is standard practice, but I do love the mini hand massage at the end.  She also does a rock star pedicure - but the one day when I didn't plan for a pedicure and she wasn't available - Chau's son Michael did my toes.  Now, he was just ok in his technique but man can this kid give a massage.  AND it was a good 10-12 minutes!Prices are reasonable.  I forget off hand what a new set costs but fills are $18, manis and pedis are $25.  Add another $5 for gel top coats and french tips.Another great nail stylists (sorry if that's not a correct title) is Terry.  She's incredibly creative and has shown me incredibly talented designs.  It's unfortunate that more people don't post the pictures of her art.",1
Every home needs a nice balsamic vinegar and olive oil! This is the place to come for home and gifts! Staff is very knowledgable and make recommendations! Love love love,1
"Excellent food, great customer service! Have friends in town visiting who are huge fans of the show. Our server James gave was great and knew the menu well. Highly recommend the Hell's Kitchen burger- by far the best burger I ever had in my life!!",1
"I'm from out of town and I was able to get some key questions about their services answered by email which was very helpful (thank you Yasemin for your help). I submitted my photos online and they were ready before I arrived in town. Fast service, knowledgeable people and my prints came out great. I highly recommend them for your photography needs.",1
"We just had our flat/rolled roof replaced by Stell Roofing. Our experience was very similar to one of the other reviews - very knowledgeable, professional, lots of pictures of before/after, high energy, stayed true to estimate, etc. There was quite a bit of knowledge transfer about what was done wrong on the previous roof (a lot) and how they would make it right. The crew did a good job of cleaning up at the end of every day. There was quite a bit of additional material and labor that were not on the original estimate, and they included those as a courtesy.As is the case with roofing, they could have easily cut some corners if they wanted. Instead, they chose to 'do it right'. That's what I appreciated most - hard to find companies willing to do that these days...If you have a satellite dish, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with them ahead of time (you can always cancel) in case there's an issue reconnecting the equipment like there was with ours.",1
Went to P&E Carbon Buster and engine repair. I had the Carbon buster treatment on my 2016 Subaru Forester XT with direct injection. What a difference! She drives like a new car again! Restored power and acceleration! I love driving my car again! Thanks guys!,1
"The best service EVER from Steve Nelson - Rolls-Royce Towbin. He is just an awesome guy, very knowledgeable, experienced, and friendly. We were very impressed about how well he knew the car, then we found out that he was a master technician before. That's the right way to have a start and be promoted. We believe that no one will be able to replace him. Highly recommended.",1
Ok here we go!!I've been eating from king palace for over 2 yrs and I have to say this is the best Biryani in Toronto.Quality: it's the best! What I love about king palace is that I don't have ask if it's spicy or ask for extra spicy. It's just perfect how they make it. Full of flavor. Spice level is on point.Portion: it's a decent portion and should be able to satisfy the average person.Price: 10.50The review is based on their Biryani only and the price of the Biryani is ok for the portion and quality.The curries are a bit on the pricey side but I've had the butter chicken and it's very nice as well. It's not watered.End result: it's a great place for some really good Biryani and there is a variety of curries as well but the Biryani is addictive.One again king palace you rock!I had a craving and you satisfied my craving....raising my review to 5/5,1
"I was in a rear end accident, and had to have my Toyota repaired. Rob the manager took me step by step through the process, and kept me updated on the progress of my repairs. They did an excellent job. It looks like I have a brand new vehicle. There is no sign I was ever in an accident. The guys here are professional and very kind to this working mom. They were flexible and understanding of my schedule, and helped get me back in my car. They even assisted in reprogramming my remote for the door. I recommend this shop for anyone needing the job done right.",1
Very helpful staff and this place is vegan friendly.  Cute spot to check out.  It's nice to have restaurant options for plant based diners.,1
"I had wanted to check this patisserie out for some time, but was never in the area until yesterday. This Japanese run patisserie manages to present Japanese inspired baked goods in a setting that manages to blend into the street of businesses on Coxwell.When you walk in, the charming atmosphere makes you feel like you're part of the neighbourhood, and when you look at the display cases, you'll see the usual staples like almond croissants and other types of bread, along with more upscale fair like a decorated Japanese cheese cake.I had the Mont Blanc pastry which looks like a you guessed it, mountain of chestnut paste, with a cream interior on a cake base, topped with chocolate and a whole chestnut.  The care and precision that they assemble their pastries shows that they really put a lot of effort into each piece.If only this place were closer to me, I would come more often.",1
"Always have a great experience when we visit Bass Pro. Huge shout out to the entire team answering questions and selling the guns! They are knowledgeable, patient, and hardworking! Kyle assisted us today and he provided us with great customer service! If I could give more than 5 stars, then I would!",1
"These guys are amazing.  The whole experience was trouble free.  they cleaned my tile, sealed it, and did my carpets before moving into a home we purchased.  We found a few areas that we were concerned with, and they actually called us before we could call them to let us know they wanted to come back out and try to take care of them.  I have already recommended them to several friends.",1
Yesenia knew exactly what was needed to get rid of my tension headache.  60 minutes with her is all I needed to feel soo much better.  Be sure to splurge on the hand held machine they offer.  I forgot the name but the add on is worth it!!  I checked in on Yelp when i arrived so the first use of the add on was free.,1
"This is my favorite place to go for drinks and appetizers. On Fridays the paradise location has salsa nights. It's a plus to get to see people dancing and having a good time. Love the stuffed dates, apple salad, empanadas and beef sliders. You have to try their sangria, they offer a white and red sangria. They have different flavored mojitos which taste amazing.",1
"A local bike shop that operates out of the RTC Bonnavile transit hub. I've bought a bike here and have had various repairs/upgrades done. The staff is friendly , knowledgable and don't try to upsell you. As a matter of fact , the staff is always open to engage in bike talk regardless of what you ride. This particular shop also have a bathroom with showers that is available to members for a very minimal fee. The parent shop of this place is Las Vegas Cyclery. This shop doesn't have as many accessories as a full blown shop but they have all the essentials. Repair costs are affordable. I come back because the people are very chill and down to earth. -John is the man. Knows his stuff when it comes to bikes. Always tells you the truth and is very knowledgeable.",1
"I had a very special print framed by a local company and they just about destroyed the photo. I took it to Cashman to see if they could help me fix the picture and make a new print for me. They went above and beyond for months helping me get it right. They were patient, helpful, kind, and generous. I highly recommend working with them!",1
"The hours at this location are the most convenient for my schedule, so they're one of my favorite places to eat, but that's not the only reason for this review. They are very accommodating to vegan diets and can make most of the curries and soups vegan upon request. Their separate vegan menu is also legit, but I usually tend to go towards the Massaman or Panang curry with soy beef (vegan). Also, their lunch specials every week day has been an ultimate life saver for time and money.",1
"Stopped here for a quick espresso and a break from the snow! The atmosphere is incredible here, so unique and fun! We got espresso shots which were great and the barista really knew a lot about the coffee and the brand. Would love to come back here in the morning!!",1
Love this place. Best garlic knots I've had. And they are given out for free. Most authentic italian place I've been in this city- like I stepped into a time machine/vortex to 1979 little Italy.  Prices are perfect $3 dinner salad. $13 chicken parm. Sauces are amazing. Service was perfect,1
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in south Charlotte. The service is always solid, & I've never felt passed over or neglected while dining here. The quality of the food is very consistent, & any modifications or changes to a menu item are always happily entertained. Most times, a manager is circulating & stops at each table to ask how everything is & if there is anything they can do to make our meal even better. I always appreciate that personal touch. The only negative thing I'd say is to agree with some other reviewers that the cedar plank salmon tends to be undercooked. Since it is my favorite item on the menu, I simply now ask for it to be cooked ""medium well"" & that takes care of the (usually) raw center. Other than that, 131 Main is dining perfection!",1
We stay at the mirage at least 5 times. Samba a Brazilian restaurant in there is amazing! But the new  Pantry is hands down my fav. Their Breakfast food is the best. They are super busy early am so I'd recommend afternoon time. Janel is the best server there!,1
"I got my diehard battery stolen few months ago. (Sad but true!) Unfortunately, sears was not open at 2am when this happened and I needed to move my car from its location. So I had to go to another place of business. The next day I called sears and Tom took care of me, given he wasn't able to replace my nonexistent diehard battery. He listened to my story answered my questions and even offered me a discount for my inconvenience.  I didn't call to complain, but I didn't expect such great service either. Lol. I am thankful for Tom and thes staff there for their kindness and service",1
"Gordon has really figured out the whole restaurant thing. He knows what it takes to make a successful menu that caters to Alllll, and how to stay relevant at all his different restaurants. We enjoy dining at all his restaurants and blessed enough to have tried them All.",1
Donny and George stopped by my new place. Informed me my logic board was bad on my lift master garage door opener. Gave a few options and went with the easiest. These guys are fast and efficient. I highly recommend Sun City Garage Doors for all your opener needs AND THET SO PLUMBING TOO!!!,1
"Moku never disappoints! Great food every time. I'm addicted to their Kalua pork, macaroni salad, and sweet corn. Large portions, food fresh off the grill, and great service. Can't be beat!",1
"When I walk into Champagne's it's like walking into instant comfort. Everything about this bar is relaxing, calming, and inviting, during the week nights that is :) Champagne's is completely transformed on Friday and Saturday nights when they offer karaoke. What is better for the weekend than the best priced drinks in town paired with an environment that is buzzing and filling you with energy but at the same time providing  enough comfort, occasionally I get up to sing! It's the reason that this is the only bar I frequent on a regular basis (2-4 nights a week). Great place to have a party for an upbeat mood and intimate seating as well as bar seating (just talk to them in advance and you can reserve a booth or two). Just always such a fun and interesting place to be. I love Champagne's because it always feels like home.",1
"This place somehow pulls off being a diner with a trendy atmosphere and theme, a full bar, kitchen-bar seating and fantastic food...all while feeling like part of the Carnegie neighborhood.I couldn't have been more excited when the hostess asked me if I wanted a seat at the kitchen-bar. I felt like a kid who was getting a tour of the place while I was waiting for my food. Food. Fantastic. Atmosphere. Comfortable & trendy. Price. Very reasonable. Like a lot of other folks have said here, it's nice to see a place you genuinely want to see succeed. Word of advice. Bakn Flight.",1
I  only come over every once in awhile for a salad & potatoe. Customer service is ALWAYS awesome.,1
"This place HANDS DOWN has the best ice cream in Charlotte. But don't expect your favorite flavor to be there twice in the same week, they're rotated or just as quickly as they are consumed. My only recommendation is to add their flavor list with descriptions on the wall; customers get bottle necked when it is time to order because they're just seeing the flavors for the first time.",1
"Good food and service. The pretzel is home made and very good--We had their meat loaf,pork chops, and Hungarian Sausage and all were very good. We always enjoy eating there before going to Coyote Hockey Games.",1
"We used to A to Z Valley Wide Movers for a move this past weekend. Carl and James arrived on time and had to load a truck at two locations. They did it in a professional manner and even though it took longer than expected, they were polite the whole way through.",1
"I cannot say enough about this place. I had tried a few places before Paradise Bay...and my dogs always seemed skittish when we picked them up. This is the ONLY place I have taken my dog where they are just as happy when I pick them up as they are when I drop them off. That means everything to me.I had a Japanese Chin that had several health problems and I was terrified to leave her with anyone (including my husband). But, my father was (also) dying at that time, so a few times my husband and I ahd to go out of town without any notice. Each time, Paradise Bay took my dogs with no problems...and gave all the medications that she was on. My Japanese Chin, Molly, passed away a little over a year ago. But, they even sent me a card when they found out.Currently, we have 2 larger dogs, a lab & a pit. Some places will not take pit bulls even if they pass the standard temperament tests. Paradise Bay doesn't discriminate!The staff is always friendly, especially Brandi. They are always happy to see my dogs, and more importantly my dogs are always happy to see them! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM for daycare and/or boarding.They offer grooming services which I find really convenient. Their rates are also really reasonable. For 2 dogs its about $40 a day of daycare (7A-7P) for daycare & $70/night for boarding (which includes the daycare!)I, also, like that they are on Facebook so I can get in touch with them that way to schedule services. I find that really convenient.New clients get a free day of daycare, so you can literally try them out risk free.Like any business, they have hours of operation that you need to adhere to, and I have never found it to be a problem to get there by 7P.This is literally the only place I trust my dogs with when I go out of town. I feel total peace of mind leaving my babies with them!",1
"Very knowledgeable, friendly, and CURRENT - Pamela is your go-to ND if you want a holistic experience that will truly transform your life for the better!",1
Theeeee best seafood buffet on the strip! The Korean BBQ is amazing! Theres a great variety of fresh sushi and the crab legs are very big with plenty of meat!  A must go when your in vegas!,1
Manager was awesome. Abigail beat up my problem shoulder area like a champ. Where does she get the POWER???,1
"The buffalo burger was everything we had heard it would be.  The restaurant was extremely busy and staff was very efficient but friendly.  Awesome setting--renovated Sears historic home.  After viewing some delicious looking breakfast dishes, we will return and try breakfast.",1
"Best local pizza delivery spot! They have a great menu, and their pizza sauce is very good. They are quick in terms of delivery however just give advance notice during prime times (weekends and game days). On average it's under an hour from ordering to delivery.",1
Well the name of this place says it all!! One of the best places for donuts in the Phoenix area! All the employees are all very friendly and the place is kept very clean! Try their Tiger claw... its one the best!!,1
My neighbor and I came here to have breakfast. This place blew me away. The customer service was very professional and courteous. The food was prepared and brought to us faster than we were anticipating. Which was AWESOME!!! I think this has been the best dennys experience here in the state of Arizona. Good job guys. :),1
"On my cab ride from the airport to the hotel, my cab driver told me this place was the best for pizza and that the founder was a James Beard awarded chef. When I first arrived I was told there was about a 30 minute wait, no problem since I knew it was worth waiting for. I couldn't have been waiting for more than 5 minutes when they called my name though! I can't remember the name of the pizza I ordered but it was a white pizza with caramelized onions and fennel sausage and it was pure heaven.",1
"Every opportunity for Stone Creek to excel in product and customer service they DID 100% perfect.What was to have taken 4 weeks was done in 3.  The price was astoundingly low for the 10' x 8' wall unit.The craftsmanship and quality of finish was factory perfect.  (I have been in the contract office furniture business for 45 years.)Linda, Store Manger, gave us a shop drawing and quote while sitting at there desk.  It was all on CAD...and VERY easy to design.  She also asked us many questions about things we had not thought of to include in the unit.Their delivery team was excellent.  Clean...efficient...and they cleaned the unit before they left.I cannot say enough about the great experience we have had with Stone Creek.I would recommend them to ANYONE as being price fair...responsible...done perfectly.LKCOWBOY",1
We love the 25 year aged balsamic and the chocolate balsamic. The chocolate balsamic in particular is great on strawberries and cream or peaches and cream. We bought from them when they had a little kiosk at the Seventh Street Public Market. See you soon! We ran out!,1
"I had to choose from a list of insurance-approved body shops to get my car repaired after an accident. Mike's Auto Body was nearby and more highly rated than other convenient options. They did not disappoint. The turnaround time was quick (less than 3 days) and they did a great job! My car looks as though the accident never happened and I am quite pleased with the work. They had to fix a large dent and some scraped paint.The neighborhood the shop is located in is not great (some interesting ""characters"" soliciting in the intersection nearby), but the shop itself is clean and comfortable. I did not feel unsafe going to and from the shop in daylight.The customer service was excellent, as well. Everyone I interacted with was professional and courteous. I was continually updated with progress on my repairs and they were actually finished a day earlier than expected. I hope I don't need to go back to Mike's for repairs, but I would definitely choose them again in the event of an accident!",1
Ive been here three times now and every time they have really hit it out of the park. The staff is incredibly friendly and most importantly the ice cream is fantastic. I love what they are doing here and I really cannot recommend this place enough.,1
"So We absolutely love this place! Our favorite plates are the seafood mix,  Island Bbq mix, and the short rib plate. Although we don't eat there and our order gets mixed up sometimes which they are  really good about fixing! They have vreat staff and have come to pretty much know our order and names who wants what lol even though we aren't there often. They can help anyone if you are a newbie and don't know what to get, that's what they did for me. Hence my bbq mix, chicken  (so juicy) the beef (good reminds me of carne asada ) and short ribs (mouth watering). Sorry my review is all over the place, I am eating and writing and well. Yeah",1
We celebrated my husband's 45th birthday here. The food was delicious and the decor within the restaurant was beautiful. We will definitely go there again.,1
I had my ba on Monday and I'm now starting to feel a little bit better! I am soo happy and in love with them so far! Misty was soo nice and helpful with choosing the right size I'm soo glad I listened to her we choose the perfect size of 520cc. I was a 34 b before surgery! Dr. Richards did an amazing job and I'm so happy I choose him! His staff made me all feel soo comfortable the day of surgery since I was extremely scared! The anesthesiologist was nice and had an awesome personality! He did my iv and it didn't even hurt! I highly recommend dr. Richards and would definitely go back to him for any future procedures! Hands down the best!!,1
"Tacos a fantastic. Specially the Al Pastor.  If you want authentic Tijuana tacos without  the TJ thrill, this is the place to go.    Place is very clean and all employees are very friendly.",1
We loved everything about this place. We had the tasting menu and everything was so fresh and very tasty. Sean gave us excellent service and the desert was scrumptious! Would recommend,1
Love this place. The team is so friendly and my puppy comes back looking fly and just like the teddy bear I've always known. Lucy Pearl enjoys her time here and will be back. Thank you for taking such good care of her.,1
I personally did not have the pleasure of going to this shop but my husband took my son. We made the mistake of going to another shop ( I will not mention) I honestly did not think his hair was even salvageable! After a HORRIBLE botched haircut this poor kid just had they were able to not just fix it but give him an amazing haircut! Thank you so much for getting him in so quickly and making his day! His hair looks amazing! I will never again take either of my sons anywhere else!,1
Thank you for a wonderful and magical prom night Jet Limousines gave my son!  Constantine the best driver in the world and Maryann coordinated perfectly.  Many many thanks and I can't wait to use your company again.,1
"01/12/2015 I locked myself out of my house and fortunately I had my smartphone with me. I went on Yelp, found Silverstate and asked for their help. Mike and Ezra showed up exactly when then said they would, provided their ID, unlocked my door and charged me a reasonable rate.  They were timely, professional, polite and informative.  I highly recommend them.",1
I've been to some great poke places and this one is really fresh and delicious with lots of great add ons! The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.,1
"Loved everything bulgogi--tacos, nachos, combination plate.  It's all delicious, with very friendly service. Expect to wait longer than fast food; everything is made to order and worth the wait!!",1
"The 25 $ dinner deal is such a good deal I couldn't believe it till I paid. Tried the salad, pumpkin butternut bisque, duck fat fries, lobster tail, calamari and steak with chimi. Everything was amazing and our server was really nice and had an answer for all of my little questions. Awesome place especially for the price. Oh and also now they have seafood Sunday so all seafood items are half priced on Sundays!",1
"I'm currently staying at Camelback Inn for 3 days. A pleasant treat after a molar extraction last Friday afternoon. Although I've sworn not to be seen in public with a swollen face, I am truly enjoying this trip. There's a trail just behind this resort and a completely awesome view of the hills. Awesome and I mean it.My hubby is out on his meetings and I'm juggling my work (the luxury of running your own biz, take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want, well not most of the time.. ). Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack. Excellent service, friendly staff (especially the  handsome young german ;)). Anyway, ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange, delish. My lil' girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl (raspberry or is it strawberries?) with peaches and berries.. I had a few spoonful, yummy.Kids menu was dirt cheap, fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty.I still have until tomorrow. Maybe if I have time, I'll head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah. Oh, as for the room, great decor, quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun.Simply love the view. It takes me away from everything. I'm in heavenly desert.Highly recommended.",1
"Everytime I come here I am delightfully surprised by the high quality of the food for the great price, plus the staff is so friendly!!!",1
"I came in an hour before close and although some staff were cleaning, I didn't feel rushed to get my froyo and get out. Everyone was really friendly and the place was amazingly clean!",1
This is honestly the best nail salon in the Valley!! I've been to numerous other salons and this place is the best.  There is not one nail tech that I would not recommend.... They are all amazing artists.  Mary is by far my favorite...but I don't bat an eye to go to another nail tech when I do a walk-in and she is not available. Never had a bad experience and I've recommended this salon to all of my friends!!! Top Notch Place!!!!,1
We always have a great dining experience here.  The chicken tenders and waffles with the strawberry butter and buffalo sauce are real good. The banana split waffle is another favorite.,1
"Yesterday I visited HON-Man Auto care in Tempe for service and repair of my Honda Accord. I am a regular customer of this establishment and once again they performed with maximum precision and expertise. They never cease to amaze me how they value integrity and quality of service. I have 178,000 miles on my vehicle and it still runs fine, thanks to Tait and Dave and the rest of the staff. They are the best.",1
"Great service! 10 out of 10 if I could! I normally don't write reviews but felt they deserved one. Went in to get a new tire for my bike, figured I would have to wait since it's the first week of school and would be pretty busy. I literally was out of there within 8 minutes with a new tire and not bad on the price either for a tire. Definitely will be back if I have any more bike maintenance needed. Keep up the great work!",1
"We just got our carpets cleaned with Treadstone, and we are absolutely THRILLED with the outcome. We had horrible pet stains on our stairs, landing, loft and bedrooms, and they are all completely gone! We weren't expecting the results to be this good and couldn't be happier. They were professional, courteous, quick in terms of scheduling as well as time to complete the actual job, and they are very reasonably priced. Our carpet looks brand new again! We highly recommend Treadstone, and we will use them next for our tile grout and windows. I'm sure we'll also use them for carpet again too (since it's likely my 5 lb Chihuahua will stain it again at some point:-). Great experience all around and highly recommend.",1
"I can't give this place enough stars! Locking yourself out, whether it's your car or your home, is such a stressful experience. Calling locksmiths because you ran out of options to get access, is just icing on the cake. You don't know if you're getting cheated, overcharged, or will get smacked with excessive fees after the service, or better yet - ""we only take cash,"" when taking the leap to make those calls.I wish I called these guys first! The quote they give you is the cost they charge you, no hidden agenda or fees. And it was well within the range of what to expect for the service. They said someone would be there in 40 minutes, and it was actually under 15 minutes waiting time when he arrived. He wore the trademark colors for the company to easily spot him waiting outside. He was courteous and kind, and had me inside within 5 minutes! No damage to the lock whatsoever. He even offered to make a key if I needed it for a flat fee. I HIGHLY recommend these guys! Word of advice: skip the first two locksmith search results on Google that are there as ads (it'll be labeled as an ad if you look carefully). In frustration and haste, it's easy to just start at the top and start the calls. Lots of these folks are vultures. I got quoted $15+$35 on the phone, which quickly became $125, and might have resulted in drilling a hole in the middle of the entire lock, which will cost more, which will then need a lock replacement, which of course, will cost more. Another company kept sending me petty texts an hour later (""I guess the price I gave you is too much."") Beware!!",1
It's a family staple now. Crazy combos and don't for get the cool pup treats they have.,1
"Thanks to the friendly staff at the pet hotel. Our dog always gets lots of attention & good care at this facility. Thanks so much for the thoughtful Christmas gift. Love the useful logo bag w/ goodies! It truly is a ""pawsitively""  kind gesture!",1
"Just came in after 2 years and I was greeted by Julie Bemis, she was extremely helpful. I had lots of questions and she was very knowledgeable as well. I came with a purpose and didn't feel and sales pressure from her. Which I like. I even had my 3 year old and she was even good with him. Seriously if you come in ask for Julie if you want great assistance, not only is she knowledgeable she truly seems to love her job and the plants. Which is a great combo",1
"This place was awesome! No line up just like the reviews said, great service with a smileThe food was really goodHad the short ribs bennyAnd caesar, very spicy but funAlso shared the avacado toast! Lots of unique flavors Worth a go!!!",1
We had a good time. Tried the ayce pizza and salad. The salad was fantastic. The thin crust pizza was great and since Noone else in the place was doing ayce we got the whole pie and they weren't concerned if we didn't eat it all. The people are very nice. Don't forget check in for free dessert. Yums,1
"I went in today and everyone was nice and respectful. Right away I was taken care of, and was listened to about my wants and needs. This is the second time I came in and the first time I felt the same. However I did an eyebrow wax which I enjoyed a lot as well, the shape they did was perfect plus it was quick.",1
Just as good as macayos just ate there last night.   We didnt have to wait at allThe services was great and fast.  Love there TCT's.  The smooth sauce is the best.  Cant wait to go back,1
Great noodles! This was my first time eat here and it was beyond expectation. I ordered the Shang Beef Noodles with hand pulled noodles. They give you a lot of beef and noodles which is always welcomed.,1
"I was walking on the treadmill, cooling down after my workout and I went to check in at the gym on Yelp....the first few reviews that came up were all negative and i was shocked that my gym had such a low star rating....So I am now compelled to write a review and really put things in perspective for you if you are thinking twice about joining after reading those bad reviews...#1. You are at a gym not the Rtiz Spa....So there isn't' someone waiting on your hand and foot every second. If you need something done there are always people at the front desk, trainers in their ""area"", and the manager's door is always open. All of the employees greet/acknowledge you verbally, with a smile, or a wave whether they are busy or not. That's pretty great customer service to me...#2. You are paying for a GYM membership...not a SPA membership...so yes they will charge for extra amenities like tanning, towels, smoothies, kids club, etc. There is no reason that I should pay a huge monthly fee for services that i don't plan on using...so splitting up the cost so that people like me that go to a gym to actually use the GYM aspect of it don't' have to pay for the ""extras"". That being said, if you want to use other stuff than the GYM then pay up! I have been a member of several gyms--mostly Gold's (going on 3 years now!) but also Sport and Health and Fitness First (those are two fairly large chain gyms but not sure if they are only on the East Coast) and they all have similar policies...you pay for the amenities that you want to use.#3. I have been a member for this gym specifically for 2 months and I go there 6 times a week. I have never EVER seen an ""out of order"" sign at any machine. #4. The gym is always kept in immaculate condition. I am always seeing one or two people cleaning something every time i go! #5. A gym is still a business...if you need to move or just want to stop going you need to give them notice....just like at your apartment or any other place that you pay a monthly subscription fee. That's just the way it is...#6. Yes the gym gets crowded at peak hours....that's why they are called peak hours...grocery stores also get crowded on the weekend...does that mean that they are horrible places and deserve a lower rating? Not in my opinion.Anyways....The trainers here are very knowledgeable as they have helped me out in the past with a few things--I've seen them work with a whole range of people from athletes to people who are trying to loose a lot of weight. I've only seen a few of them in action (Robert and Mike) but they are there all the time and so friendly :)",1
Good place to eat All-You-Can-Eat. Very cheap as well. Service is alright but let me tell you. The sushi is amazing.,1
This place is a great place to bring the kids and all of the family enjoyed it. I love the dairy free options. Always a friendly and help staff willing to give plenty samples.,1
"This place is my go-to for great Italian food, the hosts are always very pleasant and accommodating, food is amazing I've had everything from pizzas to their pastas there hasn't been anything I didn't like and the prices were more than fair. They have a really unique hot sauce(chilli sauce), it's home made by the owner, no idea what's in it but I'm a fan! Their tiramisu is my weakness, that's the one thing I can't help ordering love it!",1
I have been going to cobblestone for years now and they have always provided me with great service! This location is by far my favorite. Yesterday was my first time here. I had my oil changed and it came with a free wash. Customer service was excellent. Everyone was so friendly. We will be back.,1
I have been going to see Shannon for years! She does an excellent job! I trust no one else to take care of my hair and keep it looking healthy and beautiful!,1
"Wow what a wonderful dining experience.  Started at the bar while we waited for our reservation as we arrived early as planned.  We both went for white wines and both were very good- both recommended by our bartender Alex.  We had the Piadina app, great flavor and went well w/both wine selections. Flat bread with basil pesto/fresh basil/kalamata olives/tomatoes and feta. Alex was great and knew the menu well.  Very attentive while not being hovering.  The bar area is small but cozy. Menu is extensive.  Complimentary Focaccia is offered at the bar w/olive oil and balsamic as well as at the dining table.At the table we started with the seafood salad.  We wanted to try a little of everything.  Great salad and could be a dinner size salad.  We took half of it home since we were having a full meal.  Very good.INSALATA DI MARE  - Shaved romaine hearts, calamari, jumbo shrimp, octopus, orange slices, grilled zucchini pappardelle, red onions & tomatoes, tossed with citrus olive oil dressing. Entrees below were both very, very good.RISOTTO MARE E TERRA - Italian Arborio with onions, wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, scallops & large shrimp in a creamy vodka tomato sauce.POLLO CANNARELLA - Chicken Piccata with black & green olives in a lemon 18 caper sauce and white wine.  Served with aglio e olio fettuccine & mushrooms. (I substituted veal for $4 extra)The risotto was perfect and packed with flavor.  A little rich but one would expect that w/a cream sauce.  Enough for 2 meals.  The veal was thin and cooked perfectly.  While I am not huge fan of capers, they were melded into the dish without coming across as the main flavor.  The combo of the lemon sauce and veal was a great recommendation from Alex.  You can sub side items.  The veal saltimbocca comes with grilled polenta and the chix picatta has fettucine.  You can have either side.  I took Alex's recommendation and had the Cannarella above but subbed veal.  Fettucine was perfect al dente.We finished w/the crème brulee and honestly, the best I have ever had and I've had a few.The restaurant was packed by the time we sat down but we were able to pick our table or booth out of about 5 avl.  All staff were making sure no one was wanting for anything while again not being hovering or asking every 5 minutes if all was OK.  Our server was very efficient, did not bring everything at once (my pet peeve) and was avl when needed.All in all for our Valentine's day out, this dining experience was about perfect.  They also accepted a reservation for 2.  I had called about for a reservation and 3 restaurants in a row were keeping their Friday policy of no res for l/t a group of 4.  Really I believe V-day is meant for 2 people or groups of teens.  Oh well, their loss and our gain.One of the owners Juan was about and avl and also spoke of their history, per our request, and like Alex was available but not intrusive.  Very nice man I must say.  The other owner is the chef but we neglected to ask his name.  I know both men have a history of managing and cooking in Italian restaurants.  Tutto Pasta I believe for one.  We love supporting family businesses.  One post here on Yelp stated they did not like the fact that a little boy was running around making noise.  We saw the little guy and he was well behaved and remained near the kitchen.We really enjoyed all and will go back for sure.Need the menu?http://www.nonnosristoranteitaliano.com/dinner-menu.html",1
Jimmy johns has ALWAYS given me a friendly greeting & a correct delicious order. I do wish they extend thir delivery area though because they are my fave and I'm one street out of reach. Thank you jimmy johns,1
"I found this little gem tucked away by my church a couple of months ago. Since then, I've eaten here at least two and three times a month.The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. My favorite go-to on the menu is the Greek Salad with chicken. It is so tasty and huge! I never have been able to finish it in one sitting and always end up taking the leftover chicken home. Also delicious? Their baklava. It is melt-in-your-mouth good.I've taken many friends and family here after church and everyone has loved the place and added it to their list of restaurants to frequent.Just writing this review, I'm now craving their yummy salad!",1
"Wow. That is all I can say. I am left speechless after eating what is quite possibly the best lunch of my life. Let me tell y'all, I've been craving some decent barbacoa tacos for soooo long...it's almost pathetic. But, the wait and the struggle to find good barbacoa tacos was ABSOLUTELY worth it. The tacos at El Birotazo are mouth-watering delicious. Your tastebuds will be met with an explosion of flavor as you sink your teeth into the taco and the barbacoa broth drips from your mouth. This is what a good taco should look and taste like.",1
"Visited Dr. Kupka and Colleen to get my Botox and some fillers done. I have to say I'm always scared to try someone new for Botox because I never want the ""frozen"" look or the big duck lips but they are amazing! They took their time and listened to what I wanted and my concerns and did an awesome job. My lips are so subtle that no one can tell that I have fillers in, but they look fantastic. I even brought my husband in and he's doing his Botox with them as well. I 100% recommend them!",1
I had the pleasure of meeting Anji this past Thursday. Anji's talent is immeasurable.  She is beyond amazing!  I left there in awe.  Thank you Anji. You have changed my life in more ways than you will ever know.,1
"Until Rollin Smoke opened up, the barbeque  in Las Vegas was HORRIBLE!The guys at Rollin Smoke know their BARBEQUE !!!  Everything on the menu is fantastic!!  More specifically, the pulled pork, the brisket and the meatloaf.This is the only place in Vegas to get GREAT barbeque; and to make things even better, they are Razorback fans!!If you're in Vegas and you're lookin for some great food; stop by Rollin Smoke!!Woo Pig Soooie!!!!",1
Forget Panera & those other sandwich shops. This place is outstanding! Food is always fresh & delicious.,1
Wow so professional and amazing service!  We were told a 2 hour wait and we only waited 30 minutes and they treated my son with such respect.,1
The owner made good on the inconvenience. Great customer service and she was very very nice and apologetic. The gained a customer back! Thank you :),1
It's been my and my family favorite place for seven years now.good service amazing rolls.wish I could give them 10 stars!!!,1
"I LOVE this place. The food and drinks are incredible and on top of that, I really don't think I've ever met anyone nicer than the staff. I always go to the one in ASU's design building and I've never ever once had a bad experience. I'm in college, and tight on cash, and the employees always help me pick the best drinks that are inexpensive. Amazing, every employee here definitely deserves a raise!!",1
"Had the poutine with Kalbi beef and It was delicious!! The one serving would've been a meal alone but I split it with my BF. Perfect late night snack, great decor. Who doesn't love cute cartoon cows? The service was top notch!",1
Every visit is nothing but perfection! The Dominick's know exactly what they're doing.,1
"Left my four babies here over Christmas!  Have never felt so comfortable leaving them somewhere before. Two of my Chinese Cresteds need meds twice a day and one needs eye care all of the time. Everything done exactly as I asked. They seemed so happy when we picked them up. Our Zeus likes mom and dad and that is it. We got there and he was following Sue around like they were best buds. All of the staff knew each of them by name and they all seemed to have a favorite. Their belongings were all gathered and accounted for neat and clean. So excited to have found this place we feel like we can plan some more trips while we are in the Phoenix area. Oh and did I mention that the place is really clean and didn't stink at all. That is pretty amazing in itself. If you are like us and love your pets and hate to leave them this is the place to go. I could go on and on but you should get the picture by now!  Thank you Preppy Pet I will comfortable leaving Pixie, Samson,Zeus and Odin in your oh so capable hands!",1
Love it here! I come Often with my boyfriend and we really enjoy the amenities and the awesome views this plan can offer. I do wish there were less kids in the pool area but that's just me and my personal preference. Nothing against the hotel :-) Do visit and enjoy a relaxing day away from the madness of being right on the strip. Bonus: right next to shops!!,1
"We have now become regulars at Fresh Wasabi and we are not ashamed!!!!  Their rolls are out of this world!We are making our way through the list and have not found a bad one yet!  They are all most certainly naughty, but in a very GOOD way.  This week we gave the Spider Roll, Guilty Pleasure Roll, Untouchable Roll, First Love Roll, and Philly Roll a try... if you like tempura (and FW does it very well) you will absolutely love the variety of flavor and texture offered in the Untouchable and Spider Rolls.  The heftiness of those two were very nicely contrasted by the lightness and citrus in the First Love and the touch of spice and heat offered by the Guilty Pleasure.  The Philly was a solid, simple, basic roll that made for a good palate cleanser between the varied selection of tempura, spice, and citrus and probably enhanced our enjoyment of all the rolls.We added Sake Bombs to the meal this time and thought the libation was fun!  We had Mochi Ice Cream as a small treat to close the meal... and WOW, was it good!!  Again, a fabulous contrast in temperatures, textures, and subtle flavors between the outside layer and the inside ice cream.Why did I add the 5th star, you ask?  Because the service has met the mark... warm, friendly, welcoming, everything it should be and now more...",1
"The House Doctor team have been our exterminators for the last 2+ years based on the recommendation of friends.  They are hands down the best pest team I have dealt with in my 20 years here in Valley.  Super courteous, quick turnaround and the same great tech time after time.  If you need great service, these are the guys to call.",1
"Very tasty , not greasy, specialty donut, only seen in New York City. Rare found in Phoenix!",1
"I have a curly-haired redheaded toddler.  We call him the Ginga Ninja.  Thus far, getting him a haircut has been an exercise in incredible patience on the part of the barber/hairdresser, and V's Barbershop exceeded my expectations. V's Barbershop is light, open, and inviting.  Several staff members were visible as soon as we walked in, and we were immediately greeted and placed with a barber.   The Ginga Ninja was immediately uncomfortable, and our barber settled in, completely unfazed by Toddler Freakout.  A woman (sorry I can't remember your name!) staff member brought us a Tootsie Pop, and that simple, singular act of brilliance helped so much.  Our boy was still ridiculously upset, but between the professionalism of the barber, the ingenuity of the staff, and a whole lot of baby restraint, we got it done, and he looks awesome.I left V's Barbershop in awe of their skills, comforting environment, and attention to detail.  I will easily recommend them!",1
"today was excellent they the led my gift card to see if it was still useable. I tried out their ice green tea still drinking it. so refreshing. it's sunny out. also the service was good this person knocked out like 5 drinks with a smile on and went really quick. I been coming to this one cause its good service and fast pace drinks. keep up the good work guys. yes it is small inside due to being in the gakleria, but it does acquire a nicer outdoor space. qalso, like the fact that it's a non smoke area aka no smoking allowed. just enjoy to coming here",1
"Hey if the pizza isn't greasy, it's not NY pizza!!! We discovered this GEM about a year ago and have referred so many people here that are from New York City, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island even up state and the result is always the same, it's delicious. :)We started with a regular slice of pizza, then got hooked on the Grandma for a while, and ventured into the dinners, the Stromboli's are delicious, my favorite is the chicken parmigiana one, we do however like the previous version of the garlic knots, they changed and eh- the other ones were bigger and a lot more flavor-able. We really enjoyed the baked ziti, the ravioli, spaghetti with garlic and oil, and my husband likes the hero sandwiches and the bread is delicious, so my review is hurry up and go! The 2 pizza and a drink special is great too.... Oh let's not forget the cannoli I feel like I am in New York all over again.We absolutely adore all the staff, very personable, kind and their main focus is to see that you enjoy what you have ordered. Try it, you'll love it, and if you don't, try it again because something went wrong....",1
Favorite pizza place!!  Great pizza and bigger better portions than the chain pizza places. And cost less!,1
"My husband and I recently moved to Vegas and this is by far our favorite place for steak! The filet mignon with merlot sauce is to die for!! TO. DIE. FOR.....I can't even bring myself to try other dishes on their menu. The chocolate mousse is also delicious and my mother in law loved their creme brulee.  Obviously since its on the strip, its busy. Make sure you make a reservation and sit outside if you can! You won't regret dining here!",1
"Great place for a pint. The beer is great craft beer worth stopping by for a pint or growler. Games like pinball, arcade, or board games. Hula hoops, corn hole, etc. great place!!!!",1
Fun. Fast. Atmosphere kind of cool. Food was above average and the cost was reasonable. I would go back again and enjoy another pizza.,1
"Tried this place today for the first time.. AMAZING.. best street Tacos I've ever had, including the ones I've had in Mexico on the beach",1
"I had to bring my cat in for an emergency surgery.The vet tech was really nice, calm and friendly. My cat tends to bite people she doesn't know when they try to interact with her, but she tolerated the various indignities the tech did without even a hiss. The girl was very patient and gentle, and could tell when my cat was reaching the end of her tolerance.The vet was pleasant, brisk and informative. She explained what was wrong, the various options available, gave her recommendation but didn't push one option over the other. She answered my questions and concerns without making me feel pressured. The surgery went fine and took about as long as she said it would. Before releasing us, the vet tech explained the various medications, what they were for and how to administer them.Everyone I dealt with here was compassionate and reassuring. My cat is now back to normal, with only a teeny scar to show for the ordeal.",1
"Great customer service and quality.  We had a roach infestation at an apt. complex we bought.  Bill's sent out their best pest control person and she did a full assessment, baited, sprayed and retreated 2 weeks later.  She followed up with me regularly by phone to retreat any problem areas and within two months, the roaches I had been trying to ""bomb"" were gone! I wouldn't normally write a review for a pest control company, but they were that impressive.",1
Keith is the most fun-loving server! Loved my experience here and would recommend to anyone wanting a yummy meal and fun time out with friends. Definitely sit in Keith's section!!,1
"Best damn Hakka in Scarborough.  Tried all the Hakka joints in Scarborough,  but this joint has good food and backs the food up with good service. I keep on coming back for the chicken pakoras, chilli chicken and crispy ginger beef.   Can't go wrong with these choices.",1
"This spot is sweet. Very dark, cozy and tropical inspired. Their cocktails and unique and refreshing. Combining very tropical floral flavors to them. I recommend this spot if you want to feel like you're hanging out by the beach (even though you're in the middle of the desert at 120 degrees). OH, and their oysters. Yes.",1
The rental car building is easy to access and quick to and from the airport.  Alamo makes getting and returning your car easy and as inexpensive as possible.,1
"I opted for the adobada fries (everyday special) and for under $7 I had some deliciously crisped fries topped with guacamole, cheese, and tender carne adobada. Went with the habanero salsa and it gave this Mexican a run for her money. It was pretty legit. Will definitely try again but for now it scored a home run!",1
"Delicious! I had the Angry Sicilian sub and it was exactly what i was looking for! House made mozzarella and meat overflowing! Can't wait to try everything else! The Roasted Pork Italian hot sub is next on my list! Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean, great atmosphere, and my group had a great time! Definitely a must try for any Italian food lover!",1
"Moving is stressful! My story begins when my first moving company failed to show up one Saturday morning. I quickly went on Google and found All My Sons. Rick and Joe were able to come to my house within two hours notice. They were fast, friendly, and fun professionals that made the whole moving experience pleasant. They were able to move and unpack all of my stuff within 3 hours at a reasonable price. I would recommend All My Sons to anybody who wants to skip all the hassle and have an amazing moving day. Thanks again to Rick and Joe!From, First Time Homeowner",1
"This place is rad. Pretty excellent collection of vinyl. The guy has an ion-record cleaner and that he uses to clean everything that he puts on the main shelves for sale. Makes for excellent, pristine, clean used records. I spent a couple of hours going through their TONs of dollar bins and found 20 gems. Felt really happy with my finds. Good collection of everything...even Jazz and Blues...which I feel is always the litmus test of a record store's depth. Will come back.",1
"A classic 'hole in the wall' shop. I only ever get the patties, but they do have other items on the menu. Beef is by far my favourite, but they also sell chicken and vegetarian patties. Believe there are other varieties 'on special' at other times. Great price too! Can be a line up sometime as it is a popular place, but I've never had to wait too long.",1
Awesome service and knowledgeable staff recommending bomb juice flavors I really enjoy! They had some great yelp deals also! Thanks,1
"Best Chinese restaurant in Vegas, no kidding! At very good price, you'll have the most local Chinese Sichuan food here.",1
Best local bar dwn twn freemont stiff drinks good prices and the staff is awesome.,1
I am new to Scottsdale was told about this place from the management of my complex. Chris was so good with getting me scheduled and greeting me after they looked at my Jaguar they cleared the codes and said come back when I get another engine light. No charge great! I felt very comfortable with Autohaus they will be my new service place!,1
Ordered takeout of the Butter Chicken Pizza and sides of onion rings and sweet potato fries that come with a sweet sauce. The food is great and I cant believe the butter chicken flavour meshes well with the tomato sauce of the pizza. The service is friendly and they give great recommendations. The place is large and the atmosphere is relaxing because the place used to previously be a bar.They serve halal food and thus they don't actually offer alcohol. Their burgers are pretty famous and will try next time. They also have different unique types of pizza such as Jerk Chicken or Mexican style.,1
"2013 & Another great year as this festival continues to grow. We especially liked the addition of the ""Cooling Zones"" that had misting fans and free water in there.   Amazing selection of different brews that we've never heard of.   It was a little hot but the crowd was great.  We'll continue to return every year if we can! Loved the new venue too! So much room & shade! And the fact that he vast majority of the tickets buyers really know & understand craft beer as opposed to to some events where it's just ""kids"" looking for a fast buzz is a huge plus for me...great knowledgeable crowd with no safety issues. I met so many people that travel from other states for this event & I understand why. Great job, Motley Brews!",1
Excellent gyros and Greek salads. The baklava is to die for! This is one of the restaurants in our date night rotation.,1
"Delicious food and top notch costumer service.,Amberly was our waitress and she was exceptional , we are currently in our way to Vegas and already talking about what we are gonna have this time around .:') .. Give it a try ,you won't regret it .",1
"I love Trader Joe's!  I mostly go for their bars of oatmeal soap.  It has a very light scent, and I am often bothered by scents, so it is perfect!  I love to look at all their new items, and try samples.  I am a big fan of their three layer hummus, and they have a lot of really interesting frozen meals.  They also have some milk and dark chocolate toffee that is excellent!  I go for the soap and come home with a bunch of new things to try!",1
"Va*ca*tion a period of suspension of work, study, or other activity, usually used for rest, recreation, or travelFind a little vacation-recreation in your day to day so you don't end up living a life you need to vacation from  My hour of ""suspension from work- 8-9pm last night"" resulted in a private tasting at our local Nespresso boutique with A*AronHe was absolutely amazing, I ran in, in a hurry to get my usual sleeves and Aaron encouraged me to relax after a long day and take this time to taste the new bold flavors and truly taught me to enjoy my tasting. I surely am a women of my ways, but I would like to add I did buy one of the new flavors he introduced me to& of course still got 4 other sleeves of my usual :) Coffee time for me should be a mini-vacation.",1
"RideNow Surprise has such a great selection! Be sure to ask for Stephen Brown when you're looking for your next ride. He's so knowledge, helpful and so caring. It's awesome to know a dealership has really great people working the floor on top of great deals.",1
"I got a dirty chia latte and it was tasty. My friend got the nitro cold brew and really enjoyed it as well. We both got muffins and these muffins were above average in size! I will definitely be planning a return trip here, so much to still explore on the coffee menu!",1
"Wow, it's like Vancouver in Montreal (or at least the closest we're gonna get)! The sushi here is creatively prepared beautifully presented, tastes great and is amazingly affordable. As a friend of mine says ""every time I pay I feel like I'm stealing"".On Saturday I ate at Saint Sushi for the first time and loved it so much that on Sunday evening I went back for takeout. Both times we ordered the chefs tasting menu which seems to be the way to go. Everything was excellent, the stand outs were the Christmas Tree and the Michael Jackson Maki Roll. You really can't go wrong at this low key resto with friendly staff  and sushi rolls with names like Madonna and Bob Marley. And if for some crazy reason you don't enjoy yourself it will have only cost you $20 so, not much harm done.",1
cool place. cooler ice cream. I work up the street and like to come down on my lunch and have a couple scoops of their cookies n cream. Just tried the fudge today for the first time. melts in your mouth. definitely a new favorite,1
"In Michigan I refused to eat at a Famous Dave's because I had never heard of them, they just popped up almost overnight in different places.  Since no one I knew ever ate there I stayed away.  Today; however, I ate here for lunch and was really amazed at how great this place actually was.  I always love it when someone opens the door to welcome me into their restaurant, I know that seems trivial but to me it makes me feel they are happy I came.  Our server was equally amazing, she made sure our drinks were always filled and the food came out in perfect time.  She even remembered to bring a lemon with each one of my iced tea refills!  Not many servers remember to do this after the first one.  I just ordered the Famous Dave's Cheeseburger and could not finish the entire thing....something else that impressed me was that the manager went around with a smile, she stopped at every table to ask us how our lunch was going and Thanked us for coming in.    I know this is a chain restaurant but this is definitely a place I would go to again.",1
Great experience - clean restaurant with very good chicken and basmati saffron rice.  Healthy but tasty!,1
Great food! Love the vegan optionsI had the Canadian Platter. It was delicious! The coffee (Americano) was excellent and they have Kombucha which was a nice surprise. Definitely a good place for Brunch with my not-vegan husband (they have eggs and cheese). Will be back for sure.,1
Comfort food just like home ! Love the fiesta plate ...  Nice and comfortable atmosphere. Great music and great service. Highly recommend.,1
"Hubby and I were excited to try Taco Haus as we are big fans of Brat Haus. Anything Payton does is going to be done fresh and excellent. We started with the halibut ceviche. It was light and flavorful.The Asian preparation was great for the fish. Hubby ordered the pork belly tacos and asked for the house made salsas to add spice. He said that he is ordering the same dish again. I ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken. The skin was thin and crispy (the way I like it) and the inside juicy and mouthwatering. Hubby had to help me eat it as they was so much there. Two delicious sides came with it- my favorite was the street corn topped with spicy popcorn and 13 beans slow cooked with pork belly (Big Daddy's favorite.) The drinks were fairly priced and the tres leches dessert literally melts in your mouth. The servers were friendly and well informed; the atmosphere is ""joint like"" with great music- makes you want to hang out for a while. This Saturday we are bringing our whole crew in for lunch to try more things.",1
It's exactly as described!Never had polish food before and it was amazing! I Carnot suggest it enough.,1
"I tried this place out on the recommendation of a coworker.  My girlfriend and I managed to grab a nice table near the window with plenty of room.  The decor is a bit rustic but I really like the chill atmosphere and rustic style of the place.  Their menu had more items than I thought and they even had a menu of freshly squeezed juices.  These are very popular in South America but I never see them in Toronto so that was a nice surprise.  I ordered their picanha com queijo with fried cassava, rice, beans and slaw.  The cook on the picanha was a perfect medium rare and I loved the seasoning!  My girlfriend ordered a shepherd's pie with cassava instead of potatoes and loved her dish as well.  For dessert, we shared the passion fruit/chocolate mousse which was very rich and delicious!  What really puts this place over the edge for me is the customer service.  Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about   the dishes and and made excellent recommendations.  I would definitely love to come here again and try the other items on their menu.",1
I took a poll on facebook to see where I should get new tires and it unanimously Discount Tire. I stopped in randomly (no appointment) it looked busy. A very nice gentleman helped me choose which tires I should go with after I told him what I use my vehicle for. I told him I was crunched for time to go to work...he guaranteed it would be done (FYI it was done in the minimum time he told me). I mentioned I would hang out and get something to eat and he offered me a coupon for the restaurant next door (sweet!).,1
"What a awesome experience. Friendly, professional, efficient, and most of all, did everything they said they would do and then noticed things we didn't, and did that too. Robert was great. I highly recommend them for anyone who is in the market for a car. Thanks Robert !!!!",1
Looking for a quick lunch before hitting the airport.Pho was good and large.  Bahn mi was tasty too.Our server was quick and went above and beyond to help our son with Pho suggestions and with a glass of milk when he dared to eat a Jalepeno.,1
"I'm in town visiting for a couple weeks and I thought it'd be nice to have my nails done for the duration. I'm so glad I happened to walk into this particular salon.My technician Tuan did an amazing job on my pedi and gel mani. He was hilarious the entire time and made it a point to ask me how I wanted everything. Coming from a family that does nails, I am extremely picky when it comes to my nails. Especially when it comes to my French manicures, but everything came out great!I really liked that they had the liners for the pedicure tubs. It was a nice touch and made me feel like they take extra care to keep things as sanitary as possible.If I come back into town, I'l definitely be back!",1
It should be 7. I love the place - the price is good and the food is fresh. I always ordered the salad. I just hope that they will come to Squirrel Hill to open a store.,1
"Awesome place to live!!! Just 5 min from CWRU & Cleveland Clinic. Ok, the place is a little run down but the rent is cheap and they have everything: outdoor pool, indoor workout gym, huge laundry room, indoor parking. Front door security that will sign for your packages. Right next door, literally, is a nice forested park with miles of paved running tracks. In the winter there is a Huge steep hill in the park where you will find people sledding. A great place to learn snowboarding or build a jump and practice your backside 9. The hill is HUGE! In recall I would say the hill is about 6 stories high, no joke.  One time my friends and I were in the middle of sledding and a pick up truck pulled up at the bottom, a family of 4 got out (mom,dad,4yo boy, 7yo girl), ran to the top of the huge hill with the the dad carrying the sled, they all got on and screamed down the snowy hill. They ran back to the truck and took off!!! I'll never forget that. Good clean family fun. Anyway, the tower is awesome and if you get a high enough apt then sit back and enjoy the beautiful Cleveland sunsets. I lived on th 18th floor north view with a balcony. Great memories!!!!!Oh, the apartments come with bonus locked storage space in the building, nice!",1
Great hot dogs...Reasonably priced and very friendly staff. Will definitely return soon,1
Was very happy with my message I'm a hairstylist that works across the street. Very convenient location and she worked my sore muscles I will be back,1
"I like you roosters. Mussels, potato au gratin and malbec were all pretty damn tasty.You're good for groups, so much to share. you're good for vegetarians plus you have a solid burger and steak. Cocktails. It's one of those places that's you're afraid sell too much diversity. Somehow all is good. I'm a fan. If this was in NYC, you couldn't a get a table. Maybe you can't in charlotte. Sat at the bar.",1
"Came in on a Saturday afternoon for some beers and burgers. We sat outside on the patio, and this place is great. The beers are awesome and the food is great! Stop by for some local brew and some great food!",1
"Okay, I will preface this review by saying, I was extremely hammered when I came here, so the level of awesomeness I remember may or may have not been altered by that fact. Either way, I REALLY liked this spot.I got cozy at the bar with my guest under the funky blue lighting and soon after was joined by the Executive chef, Johnny Chu. What a wonderful wonderful man. He spent a decent amount of time chatting with us, which was cool. He really is a prime example of why I absolutely adore chefs. The only thing I tried food wise was the Wasabi Tofu, which was really good, but watch out, the first bite is REALLY hot, in every way. Excellent drink selection, but like I said, I had already had enough.. thus I am looking forward to revisiting Sens in a more sober state, very very soon!",1
"I'm not one to do car washes nor wash my car at that but I give this place props. By luck, I happen to choose this place because it was down the street from my friend's house and we were pressed for time for our road trip. I mean my car was looking embarrassing! If it was my child social services would've repoed my car from neglect. I'm so happy that this isn't your typical quick car wash. You have two terrible workers ( I mean people who work for terribles. Not workers that are terrible at their job. Hardy har har janel...) scrubbing your car down before the initial wash. I was glad for that since my car was in dire need of extra scrubbing. The basic wash cost $6 and ten dollar premium which included your tires shined and waxing. Either way it was worth the wash compared to other car washes that only do a mediocre job at cleaning off the dirt. also, using the vacuum was FREE which was awesome! Usually car wash joints charge 25 cents for however long. Besides the fact that it was hot outside and I'm not one to detail a car, I was glad for the free vacuuming. Definitely worth the $6.",1
"GLUTEN FREE dough!! Amazing fresh ingredients!! Yummy teas! If you've never been here, it's like a subway for pizza! You must come try it and they have an awesome app where you can order ahead of time and earn rewards",1
"My first time coming here for warranty service and my experience was great! Nick in the service department was exceptional in his knowledge, customer service and communication. I didn't have to make an appointment to get a new battery under warranty they took me in right away, and the only bad thing I can say about my visit there is as soon as I sat down in their comfortable lounge and started a movie on my iPad they came in and told me my car was done and it was only around 20 min? lol. Great service, great people, And highly recommended for sure!",1
"Great place.  Just had a small 15 yr HS reunion here last night.  I planned the entire thing from Florida, where I now live, and the team made it super easy.  We utilized the upstairs space, which was nice and intimate, but can easily accommodate way more than the 20 of us there.  The food we ordered was delicious (Italian sausage, fruit & cheese platter, chicken wings, and pizza) and we also had our own bartender who was great and she definitely fit in with all us girls.  The best part, for me, was that I didn't have to pay our bill until that night and nothing up front, which was so convenient, as I was able to collect money that night.  I will definitely frequent this bar on return trips home.",1
Went today with my family everyone had a great time.  When you pay to get in you think  the price is steep but it was well worth it. After 8 hours of walking and looking finally finished the zoo and aquarium. Even later in the day the animals were still up and moving around. Better by far than  the Phoenix Zoo. The only complaint is need to be more handicapped  friendly.,1
"One of the best activities in Vegas. Had Kenny take care of my company party and it was awesome. Everybody had a great time, the drinks were good and the food made everyone smile. Definitely will have to visit again.",1
"We take our pointer to A-VIP on roughly a once-a-week basis for daycare, and board him probably a weekend every two to three months, with one or two extended stays of a week per year.  He always gets extremely excited when he recognizes the streets that show he's being driven there, then runs in happy and leaves happy.  The staff are always friendly and always extremely professional.  I do note that some of the negative reviews mention that dogs smelled or seemed dirty when they were picked up.  Those times when we have had our dog washed before picking him up after boarding, he's been immaculate.  When we have not had the extra service done of our dog being washed, he then has the same ""dog"" smell that he would have after going to a dog run for an hour.  We are very glad to have found this kennel and daycare.",1
"Just had my windshield replaced on my 18 Camry,serviceTech was very professional, did a great job, and explainedEverything. Price was the best I could find, and it comes with free chip repair and guarantee! I would definitely  recommend them!!!!",1
"This was an amazing experience to ride up, while in Pittsburgh. FYI f you buy a 1 day Port Authority pass for riding on the trolley (light rail) and buses, you can use that for paying your fare(instead of cash) for riding this incline railroad. Views are amazing, you can see the historic stations on both the lower and upper level, and the upper level station has a lot of nice historical pics along with a nice gift shop.I'd personally recommend walking 2 blocks north on Grandview Ave once you're at the top, to take in the most clear view of Point State Park. Versus only looking from the observation deck that's next door to where the upper level station is. My original plan would've been to take the Duquesne Incline up the hill to Mount Washington, walk south from here to the Monongahela Incline, then went back down. A lack of time on my recent trip was the only thing preventing me from that, but hopefully next trip I will do that.",1
"The employees at Abbey Dental are a very sweet bunch! Starting with a cheerful hello from Linda, who also helped fill out my paperwork, I have a tremor that makes my hand writing look like a Doctor's, to Alexis, who assisted with my exam, xrays, etc. The staff was sincere, enthusiastic and supportive. Then there is the silly (but smart) Financial Advisor Anthony, who I teased at least 5 times. He and the staff got a big kick out of my jokes. Then the next night I broke a tooth. They were more than willing to take me in but I couldn't find a ride from Mesquite. However, they did all kind of gymnastics getting me in to see Dr. Mohlman and his tech Jennifer. They even spent 2 hours getting started on work planned for next week! For kind, accommodating, and occasionally silly people look no further than Abbey Dental.",1
"Oh XS! How do I begin...This is Seriously the best club I have EVER been to. I didnt have any problems with bouncers or anything.. I was given the opportunity to cut the line.. but i did had to pay the 20 Dollar cover.. My Boyfriend and his friends went early and got in with no problems and their cover was 30.. not too bad for a Vegas club.. I guessI went back in Feb. but The memories are still Fresh in my mind.  got in and all I could do was look  around at the Lovely Decor! Plenty of Stripper Poles! inside was kind of crowded but outside...OUTSIDE... You can DANCE in the POOL! I mean, at what club can you do that??? I can't wait to go back when its 101 degrees outside (at midnight)... anyways.. there is tons of walking/dancing room outdoors and if you look hard enough. you'll find the blackjack table on the other side of the pool. All in all I had a great time.. the Music was on point but the drinks were like 12+ and I mean $12 for the Lemon Drop Shot I had..Best Advice... Pre Party or drink in the lobby before you get in line... XS I can't wait to see you again!",1
"Frank from Hays came when I was looking for a second opinion.  ACE tech had come out the day before and said our AC unit compressor was bad and tried selling us a 11,000 buck system.Frank did a thorough inspection and found that the previous tech had left the blower on our HVAC system disconnected. That caused the AC unit to overheat and shut off, to which the ACR tech claimed meant a bad compressor. Frank pointed out that these units have a fail safe that kicks off when over heating. The overheating was caused by the previous tech not reconnecting the blower.Honest service from Frank and we will call Hays again and again.3/9/2018 UPDATEWe continue to be impressed with the service Frank provides. He came today for our yearly AC checkup.  Same great service and professionalism.To top it off, the owner Chris Hays stopped by to introduce himself and thank us for using their service.Top notch!",1
Stopped in for breakfast this morning based on Yelp reviews. Was not disappointed! I was grabbing food to-go and was advised to try a peanut butter banana parfait. It was delicious and filling! The wide variety of flavors and preparation options means this will now be a weekly stop on my way to the office!,1
"hey, this was a good hike, if you actually keep going after the small spring you actually have a much better hike up ahead with some great nature scenes and views of the stream",1
I am really impressed with this gym! Both of my girls go here (ages 7 & 4) and we've been coming for 1.5 years. They pay really close attention to the kids abilities and the coaches we've experienced are great. I kind of feel like I love here - 2 nights a week for 2 hours each time - but my kids really enjoy it so it's worth it! They definitely push the kids which to really like to see. I highly recommend if you are looking for gymnastics did your child!,1
"How some people below give it 3 stars is beyond me.First time I went my gf was mad at me and giving silent treatment. Strawberry, cream and marshmallow rolled ice cream made me go from enemy no 1 to bestie.Second time she came with and loved it.Third time I had to try the crêpe.Fourth time... Well that's this weekend due to my diet. You get the point.Yes there is a wait. But they are literally making it for you from scratch. Can't complain about it not being fresh.",1
"We own property in Las Vegas, but live in Los Angeles.  So, finding a good property manager was important.  We had a previous property manager we were unhappy with in Las Vegas.  I contacted Renton because of his reviews and they are all true!  We had some really tough tenants that destroyed the property and Renton dealt with everything and went the extra mile to get our property back in shape.  He is very attentive and easy to reach as well.",1
If you are in the mood for Jamaican food this is the place to go. We had the Jerk chicken and it was nicely seasoned while not being too spicy. Also tried the Ox tail with Peas and rice. Very tasty gravy and great flavor. Wish there were more in a large order. Also tried the Goat Roti and it was really enjoyable. The portion size was adequate. Can't wait to go back.,1
"Seriously laughed my head off the entire way through and completely understand why people see this show over and over again. When it was over and I was walking out, I wanted to experience it all over again.Bear and I commented and laughed about him throughout the entire trip. The only downside about the show was his opening act-- not funny, very underwhelming. But whatever, 15 min of that was worth it. Maybe that was the point, because CT came out with a BANG and kept the energy that high or higher throughout the entirety of the show. The night we saw him, the Luxor president & family (celebrating a birthday) were in the audience and he seemed to be keeping it as boss-friendly as possible... I would love to see one of his uncensored shows!",1
"We had Martin and his team out to repair our roof, which is flat and apparently more difficult to fix. We had a hard time initially finding someone who would take a look- High & Dry came out in a matter of days and we were so pleased with the bid!  They completed the job on time and came in even a little bit under budget! I would definitely recommend this company again to all my neighbors with the same roof!",1
"Each time I fly into Cleveland Hopkins Airport, I welcome the opportunity to visit The Pub.  I highly recommend the Fish & Chips. It's the best item on the menu, and the best I have found. And I have tried many Fish & Chips. The bartender is also very knowledgable on the beers served. Give it a try the next time your at Hopkins.",1
"Treated me very well and listened about my concern for my pet and took the time to talk about different avenues I can take with the treatment of my pet , very professional and polite , will return for future needs and assessments",1
"My wife and I got our first ink together here, and the whole experience was a blast and Dane did incredible work!  We absolutely love the South Pacific after vacationing to Tahiti, Moorea, Hawaii, and New Zealand, so we decided to get matching Tiki's to capture the spirit.  Dane's artwork was spot-on and blew away all expectations.Dane and Carlos are cool as hell, the shop is straight-up heavy metal macabre, and the artists are second to none.",1
"I've had sea salt cream but cheese mousse?! This was on some other level, and I was ready to get on it! Bover is new to the area and I have no complaints. The interior was nice and clean but a bit on the bare side. I'm sure it'll get spruced up in no time. I overheard that they've only been here about a month. The girl that helped us was super nice. She didn't rush customers and took the time to answer questions. I can appreciate that! I ended up ordering the roasted oolong tea with cheese mousse. The drink is served with a special lid so you can tilt it at a 45 degree angle to taste both the tea and the cheese mousse at the same time. Talk about a mousse mustache! The mousse paired wonderfully with the strong tea. On its own, it resembles a very light cream cheese flavor. The boba was cooked perfectly. I also tried the green tea and Oreo swirled soft serve. It was straightforward and hit the spot. I'll be back. Actually, can I just move in?",1
Found my perfect spot for an amazing facial. Julie and her staff are phenomenal at what they do and they the customer service is impeccable!. I left feeling like i got a massage as well as facial it was so relaxing and my skin has been glowing ever since. Can't wait to go back. Thank you Julie!,1
"Unique place! You can spend anywhere from $30 per person (for shabu shabu) or $175 per person. I got the lamb shabu. It was fun cooking my own food and putting together my own flavor combinations. The wine list was disappointing but they had tons of sake options. It's not listed on the menu, but you can get a sake flight. We had a good time. Delicious food. Great service. No complaints.",1
I love this place!! This was my first time going and i love it! Highly recommend. The gal did a great job on my brows and the price is great! Great for a college student on a budget!,1
"Arizona Brothers did an excellent job moving and packing my belongings. Not only were they capable of moving my Texas size furniture over a balcony in damaged, they also pack my POD so well nothing moved in the 2300 miles from Arizona to North Carolina. I was repeat customer with Arizona Brother as they helped me move in 2 years ago and I would have continued using them if I remained locally in Phoenix.",1
"Have been wanting a legit Pho spot in Mesa for a long time as most that do serve it in my area have very low ratings. This spot popped up on my ""near you"" when I was looking for food and I'm very glad it did. I got the squid,mussel, and shrimp pho with sweet/sour broth and it was excellent. Very affordable as well. They had a promotion going on at the time so it was 25% off which made it only $6 for a 24oz serving. A total steal. Would recommend this spot to anyone who loves Pho or anything of the sort.",1
"Love this place !!!! Go there, bring quarters. Have fun ! I live within a ten minute walk to this place and really enjoy going there just to unwind the brain for a few. Great games and excellent help if something doesn't work quite right. Also, try the popcorn!",1
"It's rare that I would rate a chain 5 stars but I have no problems with the State St. Jamba Juice and I always get exactly what I'm there for.  I prefer the all fruit smoothies and, surprise, they taste exactly as they should and the free boost options are nice.  They've started offering granola and surprisingly it's rather tasty, if the store would only open earlier I'd eat it for breakfast several times a week but instead I opt for it every once and a while for lunch.  The staff is friendly, it's always clean and it's really not all that expensive (I got a smoothie and granola for $7) for fruit smoothies so I have nothing to remove stars for.",1
Dan did solid work on my Porsche. Highly recommended.,1
"Tried Apteka for the first time today, but it certainly won't be my last! It has a modern, bright, greenhouse feel that's perfect for dinner with friends or a brunch date. There's also a back yard, perfect for larger get togethers when the weather is nice. We had the 1) special sandwich, 2) Bocziniaki z Kapusta, 3) Pierogis (7 for $11). 1) veggie pate on homemade bread. Taste is likened to BBQ (sweet and salty). Rather hefty portion2) one word: umami. The oyster mushrooms were well done and ingredients blended very nicely (beer, squash, miso, rye crumbs). 3) two kinds: smoked cabbage & potato and sauerkraut & mushroom. Both are very good. Felt more like dumplings than pierogis. Crispy on the outside, flavorful and stuffed on the inside. This is perfect for 2! We each tried a different house made soda: poppyseed (the most unique flavor. Tasted creamy/thick - likened to a very watered down horchatta (tastier though!!), lavender (tasted like you'd expect - my favorite), and wildflower (zesty, lemon-like, refreshing) I can't wait to come back and try the other plates!",1
"Had a fantastic experience here while visiting town. Our table opted for the Halibut spring rolls, which I'd HIGHLY recommend to anyone. What I appreciated was the description of the dish when it arrived at the table, as well - it showcased the server knowledge and the care in how they serve their guests. They tasted amazing. Although there are a lot of creative dishes on the menu, all three of us opted for variations on the Bim Bim Bap, which may seem amateur or even dull considering the cool range of options on the menu, but really, it's a classic choice, and Anju does an amazing job with it. The protein is specially seasoned, and the range of veggie toppings are clearly carefully selected.An amazing meal that won't be soon forgotten in a location I'd recommend to anyone in town.",1
"This is the best taco shop ever! I work and live near by and stop by here ALL the time for lunch. I love there carne asada tacos, cheese quesadillas, rolled tacos, and bean and cheese burritos. Pretty much anything here is awesome.",1
Rolled tacos = divine experience. So much bang for the buck too. Ashamed to be completely stuffed for $5 and their salsa is excellent.,1
"Actually four and a half starsGeorg and I like to drop a few hundred dollars on at least one dinner extravaganza every time we make it to Vegas.  We like to choose restaurants with some kind of view, and this one was AWESOME.  walking through the bar area to the restrooms was amazing, I've never seen the strip like that and I have been to Vegas at least 25 times.My parents are all about the platinum cards EVERYWHERE so I'm all about the free rooms for me and my friends, which means that it's ok to spent almost half a thousand dollars on the grand tasting menu here for two.Some things to note:DRESS nicely.  We sat there for about 4 hours or so, and saw people get turned away and make a fuss, but we also saw that the people who were dressed nicely; i.e. dresses and dress shirts + ties were seated next to the windows and the people who were dressed so so were seated in the back, or under the stair case.ORDER the floating island dessert.  this is the best dessert I have ever had.  Georg says its the second best dessert he's every had (first best at chez TJ)  I love desserts that aren't so sweet.  He loves desserts that are sweeeeeeeet.  This was perfect.  It was sweet, savory, creamy and fresh, and light. PERFECTION.The minus .5 stars comes from the small amount of leg room under our two person booth, slighty weird ""children of the corn"" type bus boy with the glazed look, and the fact that when our server asked how the food was and we said ""great!...blahblahblah awesome!"" he walked away saying ""yessss"" under his breath and gave a little mini fist pump.",1
"This is one of the best shows that I have ever seen in my life. The whole band is exceptionally talented they all mesh together so beautifully The Music lineup was outstanding and complimented in my opinion all the eras that I love and I highly recommend anyone who is staying at the LINQ and or nearby to see the show it's so worth it. The vocals, musicians the Father the son's the friends I mean just a beautiful experience kept me entertained throughout the whole time and was so impressed when he recognized Veterans for their service on Memorial Day. Please watch the show. Husband and I bought their the shirts",1
"This place is the BEST place for a street taco fix from carntias, tongue, carne asada, pollo etc... My kids love the salsa bar they can't get enough salsa.",1
"Great family run place with fresh produce, European products and amazing customer service :)",1
"Very fresh, tasty food had the carne sada crepe friggin awesome! Owner introduced himself, car show out front bonus afterwords. A over the counter camera allows you to view your food being created right in front of your eyes. Nice huh? Fresh squeezed juice, self serve coffee, great service as well-kind of a coffee house atmosphere which is fine outside dinning as well. So y'all come and giver a try",1
"I absolutely LOVE this place. I have been going for about two weeks now. My husband has signed up with me after I raved about how fabulous it is. I have not found another Yoga studio that offers yoga, hot yoga, TRX, and pilates all in the same facility. The teachers are amazing and the staff is so polite and friendly. We will definitely be sticking around for a long time.",1
Elliott Reid is the best!I love getting a massage from him. Talk about Deeeeeep tissue. I've had the same knots in my back for years and he's the only one able to remove them. Highly recommend him. He's located inside the Pearl Med Spa. I enjoy the serenity of this place.,1
Fantastic noodles!! I recommended to my friends! Everyone loves it. And it's pretty popular now.Top recommend: 1. Featured beef noodles and Pork Noodles! Noodles are very chewy and soup is very fresh and tasty.2. lamb skewer and squid skewer. Yummy! perfectly marinated and grilled. Tender and tasty3. All other noodles are good too but those two mentioned above are my favorite.Not recommend: cold dish. I have tried a few and don't like them.,1
If you are looking for a great optometrist look no more.  Dr.Johnson and his staff are amazing. My family and I have been seeing Dr.Johnson for 4 years going on 5 and I can't express how happy we are. Dr.Johnson goes through everything explains the test they give and it's a step by Step and he will answer any questions. They also have a great selection of frames too.,1
"Associate Misty, went far and beyond in helping me. I am Disabled and I park in front of the store. In July I dropped a 2-liter of soda that went under my car. I looked and nobody was around. Ten seconds later Misty came out got on her knees on the hot asphalt and retrieved the soda. She even asked if I want it replaced. She was in the store and so happened to look out and saw what happened. Thank you kind Misty. Not too many of your kind around.",1
We were looking for a place to eat with our dog. The burgers were great. Patio was clean. Will definitely come back.,1
"Every single time I visit the Kent area, you best believe I'm stopping at Taco Tonto's! They never seem to disappoint. My food always comes out hot, and super fresh. They weren't kidding when they say they have the best baked burrito. I love the huge windows in there, so when I sit at a table by the window it almost feel as if I'm eating outside. You won't regret visiting!",1
"5 stars plus!! My family and I went here this evening to purchase our flocked tree.  This particular lot was recommended to us by family friends that have been going here for years and they had rave reviews about Deerbrooke Farms.  First we were immediately greeted by friendly faces that were all eager to help us out.  The lot itself is quaint, well kept and the trees are absolutely fresh and very green... These trees are noticeably fresher, greener and beautiful to look at!  They have a wide selection of trees; from Douglass Firs, nobles, to unique Charlie Brown trees, they have it all.  It all made sense when we found out that the owner actually hand picks most of his trees!!  Once we found our flocked tree the staff continued to provide exceptional customer service.  Pat, one of the guys that works on the lot offered to take a family picture for us in front of our tree... Thanks Pat!  The gentleman that secured our tree to our car was also extremely helpful and did an awesome job!  We also found out that the tree stands they sell are guaranteed by the owner... Did I mention the high quality of trees they sell on the lot?!?!  This place is exceptional... If you're looking to buy a beautiful Christmas tree for your home that your entire family will love, look no further... Deerbrooke Farms Christmas tree lot is the place for you!Make sure you take a camera, there are good photo ops for the family there... Enjoy!",1
Very cute bakery. It was filled with people and the baked goods and dinner items looked great. I got the zuchinni chocolate chip muffin which is actually delicious! Definitely a great week day place to hang out and enjoy some good food.,1
"Sam Marshall was a great help in giving me and my sister peace of mind. He got us set up with a trust, wills and power of attorney for medical and finance. He answers all of our many questions and was very flexible for appointments. This has lifted a huge worry from me and I deff think he can help you, too.",1
"It is a great place for dessert and late night snack. We got the 4 cookies for $10 special and picked the chocolate chip, sugar cookie, and snickerdoodle. They were fresh out of the oven and melts in your mouth. Will definitely be back again!",1
Omg this place is beyond amazing the food is super fresh and cooked to perfection. I had one of the best meals ever. Coming back tomorrow before we leave NC....,1
"Excellent food ,excellent service And love how restaurant is set upLike a NYC little Italy restaurant Will definitely be returning as well as recommending",1
"Came here for a nice relaxing Sunday afternoon on the water; wanting to kayak for the morning. Zach greeted us and was so helpful with setting us up in the water. Seeing that we had electronic, he gave us a water bag for protection. Made sure we got set up correctly and felt comfortable before we got started. On the my way back, Zach was on the lookout for us and made sure we got back onto the dock without getting wet or falling in! Would definitely return, location is great and easy to get to. Beautiful experience!",1
We came here for my birthday. Sat on the beautiful patio. Gilbert was our server and he was AMAZING! I seriously wanted to take him home. So nice. So informative of  he menu. We had the best time and will come back again soon and ask for Gilbert. You know when you meet a good person. This place is lucky to have him. Thank you Gilbert for a great birthday dinner for myself and my family!!!,1
I'm grateful for this location. Shipments or computer and printing it's so convenient. Open early or late. Every worker there to date has been nothing but friendly and helpful.,1
"The new ownership has really made great improvements. Everything is very high quality and for what you get, the prices are very good. The happy hour and lunch specials are really good deals. All of the people who work here are very friendly. I will definitely return.",1
"Awesome avocado smoothie, I would go back and get more!! Super nice customer service and the honey boba was perfect.",1
I had my wedding dress and my husband's suit dry cleaned at King West Village Cleaners. My dress was really dirty from grass and dirt stain....they did a great job removing it. The price  was very reasonable and the service was exceptional.,1
Great dive bar. Clean. Super friendly bar tender. Live music looks neat. Nothing the night we were there. Recommended!,1
This my first time staying at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and i will say that it's very nice....I walked into the room and i was amazed at the view that we had received. Well since it's my birthday today the guy Kendhal gave a great gift at giving the lovely view. The room is super clean and i love a hotel with plenty of mirrors and this place haves them. One bad thing is you have to pay for parking and im not for paying for parking.... It's ok I will be back with out a car.,1
This restaurant is amazing for good sushi. The happy hour after 8 is great and has a lot of options. The blue flame roll is amazing and I will be coming back to try more!,1
"Just stopped in for a cocktail from a familiar cave creek face (thank you shannon!) Atmosphere and service were top notch. Food menu had lots of fun entrees that I can't wait to try, if it's anything like their food at burritoholics im sure it will be amazing! Their list of options for tequilas was the best you will find in cave creek.",1
"My husband and I have been here twice now for happy hour and our experience has been positive both times. The food is amazing- sometimes happy hour food isn't the best, but this place really is good. The bartender is also super attentive and friendly. He had regulars in both times we were in, but still made sure everyone in the bar was taken care of. Highly recommend the cheese platter- it's not on the happy hour menu, but it's awesome! A great local place :) we will be back!",1
Love this place. A great mix of fusion of Chinese and Mexican cuisine. I'm from the pacific NW and I'm Chinese so this a neat combination for me:) and quite original in a way. Have a craving for Chinese and Mexican food? No problem  visit Chino Bandino,1
First time at the Golden Nugget.  Wanted to find a restaurant off the street with good food.  The General Tso's chicken was delicious and their Chinese food is made at the Chinese parent restaurant so it's authentic.  A neighboring table had the pot pie and it looked amazing. Must try that next time.  Loved the bread at the table too.   Waiter was very friendly and the wait was about 15 minutes. Great experience.,1
This store is amazing. Great environment! We were greeted as soon as we walked in. They have so many accessories and mods in their cases. The guys there were so friendly they knew exactly what I needed and they knew so much about thee products. They have a vape bar to chill n taste test the different flavor a they have. So many to choose from and they tasted great!! The prices are reasonable.. Ill definitely be coming back soon!!,1
"From the moment I walked in,  I knew I was going to have a great experience.  Even though I was dining solo everyone I encountered had a bright friendly smile. Big points right there. I decided to sit at the bar for two reasons one I was dining solo and I didn't want to take up a table and two I wanted to be nosey and watch what was going on in the open kitchen.  I was handed off to a lovely gentleman by the name of Casey who was a complete sweetheart and made my dining experience even more enjoyable.  From his smile, to his pleasant demeanor to his recommendations he definitely gets five stars all to himself.Now for the food. My word it was delicious.  I regret my decision not to.take any pictures but I didn't want to be rude. Almost a full pound of yummy Frog legs in a sweet and spicy sauce topped in cashews on top of a  savory slaw was my first course. Now if you are saying ""frog legs? EWW?"" Don't knock it until you try it. They really taste like chicken,  especially if they are done right and these were done perfectly!  Next course was the Bouillabaisse.  OMG.. mussels,  scallops,  shrimp oh my. It smelled heavenly and tasted divine! Sweet baby jesus! It was in a savory tomato, fennel saffron broth that also came with a piece of toasted bread. I had to stop myself from eating all if it because it was so good and I was already full from the frog legs. Third and final delicious course was four freshly made beignets with warm caramel sauce. OMG!  I was only able to eat one piping hot, powdered sugar coated pillow of goodness that I dipped in caramel sauce. I was stuffed and forced myself to stop eating and take the rest home. I did however wash everything down with the complimentary glass of champagne that came with my meal as it was part of the restaurant week menu.  I swear I thought Casey was going to have to roll me out of the restaurant.  Will I be back? Absolutely!  I want to try more of there menu as well as some fresh oysters.",1
I love Uber and cannot imagine going back to cabs! When you order an Uber you can track the driver on your phone so you know when they will arrive. All payments are handled through the app so no need to worry about cash only drivers (is that still a thing? It was last time I took a cab) or an antiquated and temperamental credit card machine. The price is much cheaper as well! We live about $8 from the city and always take Uber if we will be drinking at all. Sometimes we take Uber if we know parking will be a pain. The drivers are typically very friendly and some even keep water bottles and snacks in their cars that they give away.We take Uber 2-4 times a week and have only had one bad experience. We rated the driver and put our concerns in the comments and Uber refunded the ride before we had finished dinner at our destination.I also like that you have to key in the fare increase during surge pricing so you never accidentally get hit with a surprise bill.,1
"Our daughter chose this place to have her ASU Grad party.  We rented the room on the left side of dining room and part of the patio.  The service was outstanding.  We worked with Blanche on ordering the food.  Her and her team did an amazing job.  We had sliders, pizza, chicken fingers, veggie and fruit trays.  We had about 75 people there.  Great personalities and interaction from all the servers and bartenders.  Was a great decision to select this place.",1
"I always go there for brunch. Pain de raisin and danois with strawberry is my favorite. They are not cheap but the quality is high. Sandwichs are delicious too, the bread ara made in bakery and it smells so good. I highly recommend this place!",1
"My first time here today with the family. We had 11:30 am reservations. It seemed like they sat the wrong family under my reservation, but we were seated quickly after they realized their mistake. We were greeted by our waiter Phil. He was very informative since we were newbies. The breakfast brunch buffet was great. My favourites were the oysters, omelette station, prime rib and the creme brulee. My husband and children also enjoyed it. I inquired about the bottomless mimosa deal. I was informed that they no longer offer that. The alternative is to purchase a $14.99 bottle of champagne and they give you unlimited orange juice with it. Overall, we had a great experience. The food was delicious and our waiter Phil was very attentive. We will go back.",1
"We shared a BIG (massive!) slice of the birthday cake along with a cup of the cereal milk and chocolate pretzel soft serve covered with their corn flake ""sprinkles""... and we devoured every last bite of everything! The cake was so good and had the wonderful surprise of having little sugary cookie pieces baked INTO the cake itself-- unexpected and delicious! And the corn flake sprinkles made the whole dessert extra special, a textural wonder. Loved it! Excellent service from Amy-- super helpful and generous.",1
One word - YUM! Great flavors and a fun place to go to!,1
"Everything was great about this place.  Service, staff and entertainment.  Not a bad seat in the house.  Great food and drink prices.  The musicians are hilariously funny.  Perfect for date night, friends or any celebration.  And trust me, they will make sure to help you celebrate.",1
"Best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Every time I come here I'm never failed.  On my most recent adventure I took my Mom and Step dad, who were in for a visit.  There was a special on sausage biscuits with gravy. OH. MY. GOD.   It was so delicious, it was ALMOST was good as my grandma's.  I savored every bite, and my only issue was that there wasn't more.  :(As always the restaurant was packed and loud. I love that about the Dor-Stop b/c it's so Pittsburgh.  Did I mention how much I love this place?!?!",1
"this place is great I would highly recommend this place to anyone , I got my nails done by Jennifer & she did an amazing job . I showed her the design I wanted & she did it exactly the same but better !!!",1
"This place may not look like much, located in a rather desolate, non-commercial stretch of the salt-river reservation. But they have off the hook native food that is unbelievably delicious!Go for the red chili and fry bread; you won't regret it. And have a chat with the owners - they're extremely nice.",1
"I have had two excellent experiences here and will always keep this on the list for Vegas trips.  Amazing breakfast with bachelor party buddies with just enough pomp and circumstance for a celebratory weekend.  Then, I had lunch on my last trip and really liked the French simple options for a moderate price.  In addition, they have wonderful house wines bottled for them in France.  Highly recommend as long as that does not make the line longer for me.",1
This bake shop has some high quality products.The chef knows what he is doing. I recommend this friendly bakery.,1
"Thank you, Nina for being so nimble and responsive to my last minute request. My friend absolutely loved his birthday cake. It was beautiful and fabulous, just like him! Definitely will be coming back and reaching out again. Keep up the great work.",1
The service was impeccable. It only took about 10-15 minutes to get our food.The sante fe sandwhich was very good.,1
"Best quality store around! The owners believe in what they do and they do it extremely well. All employees are very knowledgeable and helpful. They value loyal customers and do a lot to give back to the community. Our dogs and us love their events! As for any complaints about the place, I think when you put as as much work and dedication into your business as these people do, you want customers to respect that. Having worked in customer service for years I understand that inconsiderate and messy customers, who generally are rude first, tend to bring less friendly service.  I've never seen them be anything but welcoming to anyone. And they're not the kind of people who act fake or suck up to you for the sake of business. In a world of corporate chain blandness, they offer a great personal touch. Three Dog is the best! It adds so much to the Las Vegas commercial and cultural landscape",1
"Had an amazing taco trifecta the other night!!  All the flavors were spot on and enjoyed the different varieties of tacos available. The staff and service were fantastic. Will definitely be going back to try some more tacos & beer!If you are craving a dessert, I recommend the churros with a chocolate stout!",1
Excellent restaurant and service!!Recommend anyone who likes fine dining.They also have their signature cocktails menu.,1
"I would give this place 10 stars if I could! It's not every day that you come across a company that goes so far above and beyond in the name of customer service. I have been a member of the VIP program that includes inspections, priority scheduling, part discounts, etc. and have felt it is worth every penny (especially living in AZ where not having A/C is an emergency)  I have an 8+ year old A/C unit and they were able to recommend maintenance work to help me get some more years out of it before replacing. During the maintenance work some unrelated things stopped working and George Brazil replaced them complete FREE of charge. Fast forward, I am now a landlord to the house instead of living there and was disheartened by a call from the tenants that the A/C wouldn't turn on. A part that was replaced 3 month prior went out, and due to a technicality the warranty was voided. I  was of course not happy about this, but agreed to pay them to replace the part. When the air is out in the middle of summer you need it fixed ASAP. Later that evening after they replaced the part I received a call for what I thought was to pay the bill. Instead I was informed that some calls we made and they would honor the warranty and cover the cost 100%. I am impressed by a company that would do that after I had already agreed to pay. These guys stand behind their work. A special shout out to Conrad and Mike, you guys rock!",1
"This show was great.  The lead singer was AMAZING, the comedian a riot, and the girls were talented dancers and the best of Vegas. I really don't have anything bad to say at all. I highly recommend this show and would give it 6 stars if I could!",1
"Wow, spent $2000 on a dinner for 12 people.  Was well worth it.  Everything from the champagne and oysters to my grilled octopus was superb.    Everyone enjoyed their meals and the ambiance was nice nice.  A definitely gem in Vegas.",1
"We got back after a major snow storm. The driver was nice enough to lend us a brush to clear our car and he also waited to make sure that our car started. I've parked here a few times because it's great value, it's close enough to Pearson (5-10 mins) and we don't have to wait too long for it to pick us up after we collect our bags (5-10 mins at a specific pillar). I'll continue to use them.",1
"so much Good at this location, authentic fresh and great size portions.  Are you a fan of mexican food ?  (Silly question, Of course you are, how could you not be)  And this place did not disappoint, breakfast was eggsalant ! , service was great and a wonderful people watching spot.  I will be back.",1
"The best pazole in town! A beautiful and romantic-chic atmosphere, delish guacamole made at your table and a variety of beer, wine and tequila as well as mixed drinks to choose from. Me and my friends love going here!",1
These cookies are to die for. I have a real addiction now! They show up in great time and the cookies are warm and gooey and delicious! I love that the mixed box flavors change weekly! But honestly the standard chocolate chip are hard to beat! Love this,1
One of the best experiences in vegas I've ever had. We had just had a bad experience at another hotel and were greeted with profesional and polite guest service representatives. This hotel has a great atmosphere and is very classy for a great price. We were upgraded to a suite with a great view of the strip and the bellagio fountains. the suite had a back to the future theme with props used from the film. great hotel and great service,1
"Well my father always used to bring back food after work back in the 1980s , when he worked for Allegheny Airlines . . Always had some great stuff  !",1
"Came in a few days ago to open an account my home mortgage is through them so I figured why not, makes life easier to have every thing together, Tabitha helped me open my account she was so friendly and full of personality!! I love it! Got my new card in the mail already, definitely very happy so far!! Thank you us bank for being better than the other big names!!!",1
"I was having a large party at my home.  Two days before the event we discovered a Hot Water slab leak under the Dining room floor.  Eagle Service covered the walls of my Dining room, open the cement floor, found and repaired the leak and patched the cement.  When they left the job, you would have never known there was extensive work performed in that room.   Affordable, Fast, Friendly and service you can trust.  I have recommended Eagle Service to my Family, friends and to all my customers.  Just a note:  I'm a small business owner and I rely on my reviews to generate business leads through Yelp and other services like this one.  To tarnish a business with a 1 star review for not returning a sales call - Really!! Did you call Eagle back during normal business hours? , Shame on you Sir for giving this company a low rating for such a minimal thing and shame on Yelpforf not deleting your review !!",1
Awesome gym with friendly people.   We dropped in on a Saturday morning to get our workouts in before the day started.   The gym is equipped with awesome equipment.  If you do weightlifting this is where you want to be.,1
"Hands down my favorite burger in the world. I'm pretty sure it would be my last supper. You can literally put anything on your burger that you want, so every time I go I create the perfect burger. Anything from avocado to a fried egg, and any kind of sauce you can think of. Every night they have a different beer special, and usually a different burger special, but I always create my own, like I said, it's perfect. Though, if they ever have the Kobe beef burger special, it's a must. And to top it all off, you can get chips, fries, sweet potato fries, and my favorite, tater tots. It is hard to give this place enough praise, I just can't imagine going anywhere else to get a burger.",1
"This place was phenomenal. We shared the jerk chicken and it was SO GOOD. Every morsel was delicious. And they have Ting! They also mentioned they have a sample plate to share that has all of the other menu items. We didn't have enough room in our stomachs but have nothing but regret since for not ordering that. All of their food looked so good. Oh, and all their sauces are tasty too. And the place was clean and everyone was friendly and nice. Great, great place.",1
"SKYLAR!!!!  I hadn't been to a Fantastic Sams in years. I was hesitant but I'm done paying $85 for a haircut. From the outside you might think twice about going in. It's kind of hidden between a smoke shop and a nail place. I have long, fine, straight hair with a side shave. I showed him a photo of what I was looking for, basically a few inches off and some layers. We had a consult before he washed and conditioned me (with a massage! ). He made some recommendations for hair care but no sales pressure. I got the blow dry and style. When he was done, I couldn't believe it, it was exactly what I envisioned! He's an ARTIST!!! I'm definitely going back to him! He'll probably end up in one of those fancy salons. I'll follow him anywhere as long as I can pay Fantastic Sams prices .",1
"It had been a while since I was here.  Used to go all the time when I lived in the neighborhood, but I'm quite a ways away now.  Still, my wife and I got the urge to stop by.With everything that has changed in Tempe over the years (I miss Eastside Records being next door to this place), it's nice to see some things haven't changed.  The price may be slightly more than it was, but you can still get a great meal for under $10.00 or, in our case, just getting and sharing teh whole chicken for $12.99 (it will make two meals for two people easily).  The choice?  Grilled marinated chicken or steak (or a combo plate of both) with corn or flour tortillas and beans, salsa and marinated onions on the side.  And, to note, these are whole beans, not the typical refried you get at most places. It's simple and delicious, and you don't feel like you just consumed a lump of grease and cheese after you're finished eating.  Yes, they still only take cash or check, but typically regulars know this and make sure they have money on hand before going in.  Also, I'm sure everyone who has eaten here has finished off the rest of their condiments by just mixing the beans, onions and salsa all into one cup.",1
"Love this store.  Their Seafood & Meat counters are awesome.  Produce dept. is good.  Can find items such as FRESH Kale, not bagged, chopped.  Even found Blood Oranges there once.  Heirloom tomatoes.  Yummy!  WAY better than Woodmans, but then that isn't very hard to do.  The staff are friendly, and helpful.  This has become our favorite grocery store.",1
"I have been bringing my 3 boys to this location and we love it. It's been two years and I always recommend it to my friends. The boys are always eager to come over and have their cleaning twice a year. The new location is amazing, the people is great and the Doctor makes the feelings really painless even to my 4 year old.We are moving out of state and I I recommend this dentist 200% percent! We will miss them and the staff!",1
"We eat regularly at Casanova Bros Pizza. (have only done take-out) I think everything I've ever had is the best because I can't figure out what I like more. Each time I have something, it becomes my favorite. They have delicious pizza as well as sandwiches and pasta. The staff have been really nice to us both on the phone as well as in person. Nothing has been made wrong or ever forgotten in our order. It's been just as ordered which I value. I have recommended this place to others and hope they find it just as yummy. It's at the top of our list for places to go in the area for food. I highly recommend it. If it were possible to give it more stars, I would.",1
"Fantastic, professional, and efficient. Helped me move downtown, reached when expected, finished how they should. Didn't dawdle, were a fair price, and were easy to work with. I would definitely recommend them to any friends or family of mine.",1
I love this sushi resto! I've been here a handful of times and I always get the tasting menu. It never disappoints. I find its better when you go in a bigger group because then they give you more variety of sushi to try. The service is very fast and the tasting menu is filling. I always bring people here because it's good and fairly inexpensive. It's $25.50 for three courses. The only downside is that they don't serve alcohol!!  it's really too bad. My favorite thing on the menu is the Christmas tree. I've had the salmon and the lobster and both are delicious! It's super tasty and crunchy. The tasting menu also comes with salmon sashimi with apples cut julienne style and a vinaigrette. For two people they also give with four different maki rolls and two sauces. One is a spicy mayo and one is a vinaigrette. I will for sure be back.,1
Best tacos in Vegas! If your ever on the strip and your hungry for tacos then go here. You will not be disappointed.,1
My husband and I had a date night decided to try our the Roaring Fork. The service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We were there during restaurant week and decided to try the duck. It was amazing. The creme brulé we chose for dessert was scrumptious. We will definitely be going back!,1
"Chatime is the go to spot for a delicious drink, they have a lot of variety that doesnt dull the quality. i love to come here whenever i am around China Town!",1
"Best BBQ in the city of Phoenix! Phil has mastered just the right amount of Sweet and Spice that has set the standard on what should be called Phoenix BBQ nationwide in the same terms as Kansas city BBQ, Memphis BBQ, and Carolina BBQ! Trapp Haus BBQ is  one of three must stop restaurants in the City of Phoenix if you want to experience the taste of Phoenix!My personal favorites are the Bourbon Glazed Rib Tips, Brisket Mac and Cheese Rolls, and the Mac and Cheese Brisket BBQ Bowl.",1
I reached out to Lawrence because I saw his Instagram post and I felt that he is the most suitable hairstylist to help me with my needs. I have suffered from hair loss these past few years so I needed Lawrence to cut my hair piece (real human hair). He was very sensible not to make me feel uncomfortable about it which was professional of him. He examined the hair piece and cut my hair accordingly and then styled it. As he was cutting and styling my hair he provided me advice how to style it properly and also proper way to take care of my hair. In the end my hair looked exactly how I wanted it. This was exactly what I was looking for. Im really glad I found Lawrence. He is a smart guy who definitely has been in this industry for a while and knows what he is doing. Thank you very much.,1
"Came for the latte art, but stayed because of how good the coffee was in itself. I went during a non-peak time and the cafe only had a few other guests. There is enough space to sit and enjoy yourself. They do not have wifi, which I think makes the place more personable, but if you would want to work, you could always just hotspot your phone. Highly highly recommend visiting.",1
"Thank you so very much Sweet Poké .... as a first time customer, I asked to try their most popular sauce on the side of my order .... and they packaged and labeled all of them! Yum! So kind, so fast and so fresh, thank you!",1
"I am the biggest cluts in the world and I have dropped my phone multiple times, more times than I can count. I've actually cracked my phone a few times times and the first time that I did I would look everywhere for the cheapest place and I never found anything. Everywhere was STARTING at 150 and I found it so ridiculous. I was so lucky to find this place. It's a little out of the way for me so I go to their rainbow location but it's so worth it. Affordable, good quality, efficient time and wonderful customer service. I most definitely recommend this store! I've gone to them twice already and I recommend all my friends to this store when they need their phone fixed!",1
"Awesome salon that continues to put up with me.  Patient and welcoming, I've also never had such good color applied.  Usually my dark dye fades but this did not budge and remained shiny and vibrant. Christina is patient and talented.  Quality for a great price.  Love it here, thanks for your patience ladies.  Five stars.",1
One of best sushi experience I've ever had. The quality is amazing. Can't wait to come back.,1
I love this place...Chris is so great...everyone thinks I look great.If you can try their specials. You will be glad you did..,1
Great hospital to deliver a baby. We had our 3rd child here and the entire experience was perfect from beginning until the end. The staff treated us wonderful and were very respectful at at all times. We recently moved from an area where we had the best hospitals in the United States and Summerlin hospital exceeded out precious experiences.,1
Was visiting Charlotte for my boyfriends birthday and found this restaurant on Yelp and they did not disappoint!! I had the crab dip for an appetizer and it was devoured so fast i didn't get to take any pictures. For my entree I had the roasted salmon with risotto and I was a little hesitant because I had never tried it before but our server assured me it would melt in your mouth. Needless to say it was a perfect pair with the salmon that was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got the 9oz filet mignon and I was amazing as well. He really didn't even require a knife to cut the steak because it was that tender and so flavorful. We will definitely be back again.,1
I wish I had a before photo but you can prob imagine what a dirty garbage can looks like and smells like. After hiring Bubble Binz we no longer have unsightly gross smelly bins!! We are on or 3rd or 4th service and they remain consistent with the cleaning job and schedule and a great price.  The text reminders to leave bins out for service are appreciated !! Job well done !!,1
I saw Melissa and the massage was amazing. She came to my house and was very professional. I would definitely recommend,1
"Wowie - never have I been so impressed with an airport restaurant!  And this comes from a gal who's been to a WHOLE lotta airports 'round the world over the years.  Five of us had a nice, filling meal before our flights.  No alcohol, so the bill came to less than $50 bucks for the lot of us.  We shared hummus, fondue pretzels (omg yummmmm!!), and a tasty burger.  So good.  If you're in the terminal A area, hit this place up.  The pretzels alone are worth it.",1
"Ryanne cuts my daughter Kayla's hair every few months and she does a great job The Best hairstylists around!! And I had a facial before it was so relaxing Had a great glow !!! Thank you true Aveda , Wasana Fehrman",1
"It's rare to find ice cream better than Mitchell's!  The location is adorable-an old theater. The marquee on the outside announces the seasonal flavors. Mitchell's always allows you to sample any and all ice creams that you're interested in. My favorites are key lime pie, coconut chocolate chunk and porter chocolate chunk. If you take a pint or a quart to go, complimentary ice cream cones are included. You can enjoy your treat on the second floor overlooking the kitchen where cooks are constantly working to make ice cream. Their hours are also great. They're open late so you can stop in after dinner, the bar or a concert. Mitchell's is a stop everyone must make when they're in Cleveland!",1
Great food. Good service. Small restaurant and parking is somewhat tight. Would definitely recommend. Had the tacos pastor and guacamole. Great value.,1
"I have moved from Champaign, IL to White Plains, NY. But still I miss this small town for its food.Zas is by far my most favorite Italian place.There serving time, hospitality and price are unbeatable. Tomato basil soup, Pesto pasta with grilled chicken and tuscan chicken pizza are my all time favorites. I have tried all other dishes as well, all I can say is everything is equally best. I miss you. Please open a place in New York.",1
"The mother daughter sales associates in this place really know what is trending in the toy world!! They're super helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable about their products! Additionally this place is extraordinarily clean and organized, ESPECIALLY for a kid's store.",1
Great place to bring the kids on a rainy or super hot day. Just like any indoor place $10 an hour but in this area one of the nicest in my opinion with the most space for both kids and adults. Stuff for all ages from itty bitties to grade school age. So open and airy I didn't feel claustrophobic at all. There is a professional photo studio couches and lots of coffee table and chairs. Super clean bathrooms and a cute dress up room. I will definitely bring my girls here again. Also available is all sorts of classes like baby ballet and other mommy and baby classes. All in all good place large facility and clean most of all it's very clean. Which to me is a plus!!!,1
"We ate in and were served quickly. Had amazing pulled pork sandwiches which included pickles on the side. The sandwiches were overflowing with meat. My son wanted a hot dog but it's really a sausage or a bratwurst, he wasn't fooled and wouldn't eat it, we did and it was good. Very casual and very small dining area. We want to go back and try their ice cream in the Spring.",1
"My server, Ozzy, was a great guy. Always checked in on us and made sure we had everything we need at a quickness. Best waiter I've seen in a while hands down! He deserved every bit of the tip.",1
Healthy! This is something I really liked when I went here. There is no other breakfast place (that I know of) where you can enjoy your dining experience on a diet. The food is built to keep calories in mind while tasting delicious at the same time! (Which is hard to accomplish). Well done! I will be back.,1
Very good appetizers and entree. I think it's the best food in the North Hills of Pittsburgh. Bartender is great as well.,1
"I highly recommend Academy Glass. They're extremely efficient, good quality, fair pricing and very friendly. Niko and Jerome are expert glass installers.",1
"Went there for our wedding anniversary and we had a very lovely evening! We started with the voodoo shrimp recommended by our server, and it did not disappoint at all! We shared an amazing tomahawk steak, cooked to perfection! The sides and dessert were just as yummy! And cant forget a bottle of wine to top off a perfect meal and date night! Keith our server made our anniversary that much better with his warm, friendly demeanour and service! And Sarah the manager is a sweetheart as well! Even took our post worthy pictures for us! Thank you Ruth Chris Markham, we'll definitely be back again!",1
"Looking for some fried chicken this evening.  Found this new shop that wasn't even on the map (or Yelp for that matter).  Chicken is pretty good.  Fried okra and mashed potato sides were good as well.  Not too many options in this area, so they were popular and it took a little longer to get our food, but it was worth the wait.",1
Their tres leches cupcakes were the best! I ordered two dozen for my daughter's birthday and it was a big hit! Their service was great! Able to accommodate me on a weekend. Hands down best local's bakery in town so far!,1
Been coming here since I moved to Henderson. I use to bounce around to different barber shops back home. I had difficulty finding the right place that fit everything I was looking for until I walked into Friendly Barber and met Chat. Chat was extremely pleasant and did exactly what I wanted for my haircut. I have been going ever since.,1
"first time here, service was great and friendly Had the no name omlett very large and tasty. thanks we will be going back",1
"Love this place, especially the chicken and waffles but other things on the menu were great as well!",1
"One of my favorite boutiques in Scottsdale, I can always find something I don't need but have to have at Elan.  Lisa and her entire staff are friendly, helpful, and always have great suggestions.  They keep the inventory fresh and edgy.  Some of the pieces I've gotten there never fail to get compliments.  It can be a little pricy, but everything I've gotten there is well-made and things I'll wear again and again so... Lisa puts on some great events and really engages with her customers.",1
"Hella hit the spot when needing Filipino food.  Reasonably priced, and wide selection from lechon pacsil (sp?) to longanisa to ampalaya to sinigang to chicken adobo to BBQ to caldereta... The list goes on.  Makin it hard for a girl to choose for a 2-item combo.... Dang, now I'm hungry.",1
Been coming to Cuginos for about 4 years now and I'm never disappointed. I keep it simple and I'm always happy. Either the Italian #1 or #2 add the spicy giardiniera Best sandwich in town. Girlfriend loves the rice balls and the cannoli. Sweet and simple but oh so good and why I come to Cubinos 3-4 times a month.,1
"So we came in for dinner rsvps  and sat at the bar.  What a nice night with chris as ..or bartender and jack as the regular to my  right.  Great conversation,  fast service, and delicious food! We made it for happy hour for discounted wine and sushi.. i had the Japanese ufon per chris's suggestion with shrimp and it was delicious!!! Usually Japanese food is heavy with salt and i did not experience that with  my dish.  The croquet monseigneur of pork variety was delictable, rich, heavenly .and a perfect choice.. the frittes were perfectly preferred with crisp.... loved the bar vivre atmosphere!!",1
Awesome place. Great space with showers and great spin class teachers. Reminds me of soul cycle in la. Go!,1
"We had dinner here last night. Very attractive restaurant with valet parking. Our waiter Jake and his associates were very attentive. Great service without feeling rushed. The food was EXCELLENT! My wife had Linguine and Clams and I had one of the specials, Crab stuffed salmon and we loved them both! We also had a tasty Caesars salad for two which was great. We saved room for a Cream Brûlée and The Warm Apple Pie a la mode and they were also very good! We will be coming back as we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the dining experience here, and would highly recommend you give it a try also.",1
"Amazing. A fantastic chicken parm sandwich - well cooked, great sauce, soft bun. Great recommendations by the owner. I'll be back.",1
"i can finally say i have found the best, most reliable place to take my vehicles to.  i called and they got my car right in.  fixed in 4 hours.  called me 2x to communicate every cost and what they were doing.  they did not try to up sell me anything i did not need.  they simply fix the problems you take it in for!!  they have now worked on 2 of my vehicles and i am more then happy with their service, prices, and communication!",1
"I love this little joint! The food is always incredible - I've never had a bad dish. The alcohol list is also pretty extensive, and I love that they carry divey-bar beers like Molson Ex, as well as higher end imports, depending on your mood. I find the dishes to have the right amount of spice as well - nothing overpowering, and adding to the flavour, not just hot for the sake of hot.One bonus - I took my boyfriend for his birthday. When they found out, they played a cheesy birthday song over the PA, brought us a comped bottle of sparkling wine with sparklers, on top of a tray with heart candles. It was really sweet and totally unexpected, and really made our night. It's rare to find service like that in this city.",1
"Stumbled on this gem while walking, it's tucked into a alley, but what a great find. Very cool vibe, super friendly owner and servers- you could tell this place has a ton of return guests by the banter and smiles when folks walked in. I ordered the Salmon Campanelle - the lemon cream sauce was perfect and the balance of the dish was incredible- highly recommend.",1
"So I came here, initially, for dinner. I heard about this new blood diet craze? Thought they could spare a bag or two.... ended up donating. This location is smaller than my usual Hillcrest Mall one but everyone was soooo super nice and friendly. My blood is rare though so i can't promise they will love you as much as they love me :P Come later on during the day, I came at 540 and was outta there by 620ish.They have juice and cookie and coffee and pop and it's GRRREAT TO DONATE WHOOO!!! They're open later on Wednesdays I believe. And it's right next to the CIBC at St Andrew station. xoxo",1
"#13 original sub made Mike's way is my favorite choice.  This chain beats Subway, Togo's & Quizno Sub hands down!  We were shopping at the outlet but decided not to eat in their food court because the choices were truly horrid.  I am glad we came here because the ladies that were on shift were very friendly & greeted us well.  The place was clean, customer service was excellent &, of course, the food is always delicious.  I just love Jersey Mike's.",1
"A great central hangout spot! Awesome atmosphere, attentive wait and bar staff, delicious food and great priced drinks!",1
"I. Like. This. Hotel. If no shuttle is available to pick you up from the airport, they pay for your cab. The front desk staff is quick and attentive which is exactly what you want after a day of air travel. Room service was very friendly and the food was YUM. The toilet handle was misbehaving and while it took some time for engineering to fix it, they were beyond apologetic and did all of the things you'd expect a good hotel to do - either offer a room change/upgrade or other free stuff. The hotel is in Middleton so don't book a room here and then complain that it's not downtown. Look at a map. How is it the hotel's fault that you are in need of additional IQ points? So many Yelpers like to complain about every dumb, little thing without understanding that it's not about perfection, it's about how a business responds to a problem. This Marriott is not as modern as some others, but I'd pick a clean room and good service over some spiffy wallpaper and Berber carpet any day.",1
"I am really impressed with this store! I avoided this place for a while because I thought everything would be (Biltmore) overpriced, it's not!They have a great selection of things for a fairly small store. I loved the toys, they are the same price (if not cheaper) than the big department stores, and they're clever! I bought a ball stuffed with little balls (only a few with squeakers) that can be pulled out through a slit on the side. My dog LOVES it, it's like she gets to tear the stuffing out over and over, genius and only $15! They had these cute small rope toys for under $10, one was a penguin! They would probably make great gifts to pet lovers. Lots of different foods and treats for cats/dogs and birds. I think they even had larger animal feed, but I could be wrong.The owner/cashier was really friendly and gave us some free local chicken jerky treats for our dog. I found the same pet food I buy at Petco for a $3 difference $57 vs $60. I don't mind paying a little extra to support a well done local business.",1
"The map for this salon is wrong!  Going north on scottsdale you make a right turn on 3rd ( just past Indian school), then immediate left on Windsor and you're there! Very cute salon, Lauren is my stylist and she is amazing, I would follow her anywhere.  If your a blonde, you know how difficult it is to get just the right shade, she is an expert on blondes and knows the definition on 1/2 inch trim ( none of this whoops I said a 1/2 inch and now I've lost 2 inches)! Definitely recommend this salon and Lauren!",1
"Amazing will definitely eat here every time I'm in the area. Great service friendly people and amazing food!!!! Me and my wife split the city sampler had sausage, BBQ, Brisket and turkey and oh my it was all amazing. Some of the best I've ever had. Also comes with great Texas toast and two sides, we had green beans and baked beans both great.",1
Whoa this restaurant rocks! I love spicy food but sadly Americans seem to like sweet food  (even Chinese restaurants). This restaurant has great real-Chinese style dishes.,1
"Amazing! I had called for my husband before hand, and the gentleman who we spoke to on the phone (didn't catch his name) was super friendly and said to come on in to do a quick consult. We arrived within the hour;  first impression was that it was so clean  and tidy, the two artists working at the time were friendly. The gentleman who I spoke to on the phone said that we could come back later that same day and get my husband's tattoo done. He actually gave us a call, and let him know he would be ready within 30 mins. So we drove back and got my husband's tattoo done within an hour. Great experience and they were so nice. Joe is the artist who did my husbands custom Greek font tattoo.",1
"This place is awesome. With friends or solo mission it's the place to be. Nice, clean and friendly environment. The food makes this cheat day worth every last calorie. Check them out .",1
Great food ! Excellent service! This place is a hidden gem ! Give it a try and you will love this place,1
"It has come to my attention that Yelpers are giving Mother Falafel bad reviews because their red sauce is too spicy.Do you think that's sriracha on your falafel? Don't be ignorant. Harissa is supposed to pack heat.DO NOT RUIN THIS, YOU COWARDS.",1
"Requested Mark H. for my furnace maintenance and was impressed again. He is on time, professional, knowledgeable, friendly. A+",1
This review is for their outstanding customer service. My elderly mother was using them and she fell ill and can no longer pay her bills. I took over for my mom and had to deal with Accent as my mother took a turn for the worse and Accent was very compassionate and let me get my mother out her contract due to her decline. I'm so very grateful.,1
The food was amazing.  I tried the Koshari and it was a great blend of flavors.  I've had the koshari in Egypt but I think it's better at Pots.  The staff was very welcoming and courteous.  The ambience is very relaxing.  It's a great spot for a quick lunch or if you just wanna be away and enjoy a delicious meal.,1
"Well this review has been a long time coming. I was looking for a good local Chinese delivery as i was tired of getting bad quality food from other restaurants local to me, the problem with Chinese take out unlike Pizza if the food is bad its REALLY bad, however a bad pizza you can live with.Visited Yelp and looked up all the restaurants in my area and read a few reviews the thing that caught my attention was the no MSG huge factor for me.Called the restaurant and placed my order, It was the Sweet and sour pork, steamed Chinese Broccoli and  some spring rolls. I have tried other dishes since everything is very good have never been disappointed.This restaurant has been a regular occurrence pretty embarrassing when I went on holiday for a week and then called up to order and the guy on the phone asks where i was last week. Overall excellent food and fast delivery.  I would strongly recommend this to any one that wants Chinese food and has sensitive stomach issues the food is never greasy always fresh and the portions are HUGE.Value for money and quality.",1
"This place was really, really nice.  Very classy.  My cousin and I started our morning off at their gym - it was nice and spacious.  They had lots of equipment and ample exercise machines.  I liked how the treadmills had tv screens built-in - I was able to get my celebrity gossip fix while I ran.  Watching Nicole and Paris inspired me to keep running to burn more fat.There were lots of towels and a pretty good selection of juices.  We skipped breakfast so I had a few V8's to hold me over until after our massages when we could hit a buffet.Gina was my massage girl and she was amazing.  She has a background in sports medicine and she knew her stuff.  She gave me advice on improving my posture and pointed out some of my trouble spots.  No one has ever done that for me before.",1
I came here a few weeks ago on a work trip. As a nose-in-the-air New England-born self-proclaimed pizza connoisseur I can confidently say this is the best pizza I've had anywhere in a long time. I ate the whole thing with a glass of wine and felt very happy with myself  I would probably come back to Phoenix just for the pizza.,1
So besides hnj being the best place in the world to eat seafood they have an awesome staff.  Including this clown shoe  PIMP C. Aka (Camille)  Lol always in a good mood and on top of everything. Every time I go in and see her at any of the locations I know I'm gonna get good service.  Thanks girlie see you later this week for my weekly fix!!!,1
"I recommend these guys to anybody who will listen!  I had an ant problem and called them because my regular pest ppl never got back to me.  Brad came out, was very thorough and told me to keep him posted.  He followed up with me several times just to make sure the ants were gone. He went/goes above and beyond by following up and even getting ahold of me after business hours..I've never gotten that kind of service before!",1
Best jewelry store in Phoenix.... I was looking for the ring that would make my wife proud for many years and Marc Shutro the owner really took amazing care of us...It was amazing value and we now buy all our jewelry from Burland! Can't recommend them enough!,1
This is the best karate place in the valley!!! Dave is brilliant with kids...he has a great sense of humor but gently demands discipline from them. He's awesome!! The studio has a ninja warrior wall and play place out back for younger siblings!,1
Came here to try their vegan pizza. The pizza dough was delicious they even had vegan cheese. I sat inside for a little and the people were super nice I would come here again!,1
"First time at an Eddy's.I had Bryan as my barber. Bryan was nice, friendly, and most importantly, did an amazing job. My hair looked really, really good. He was so thorough, but quick. The space is nice, and the music the guys played was cool.Will definitely go back for my next haircut, and will definitely continue to request Bryan as my barber.",1
This is probably the best restaurant to eat Mexican food and mariscos I love it. I totally recommend the shrimp tacos y el molcajete,1
"My husband and i recently stopped at Abc Nissan and we were immediately  greeted by Miguel Ramos who was by the way professional and very helpful throughout the whole process. I highly recommend, Great customer service!",1
"My daughter purchased her first car with AutoNation, guided by Billy, she found the perfect car to fit her budget with all the aesthetics a young car owner would need!  Billy was helpful, straight forward, and made the process of finding a car so easy.That same positive perception extended to the financing, where Robert was key in identifying the best possible financing and terms.  His attention to detail, identifying her long-term goals, and working with us to ensure she walked away with the fairest possible deal and positive experience was evident from the moment we sat down.  Thank you to AutoNation Nissan Chandler! You are well represented by both Billy and Robert!",1
"Simply put: Yes.  I finally understand the function of the coffee table and the coffee table book in combination.This place is a haven of peace in the midst of the Vegas Strip's hubbub.  At first I was surprised at it's out of the way and very missable location (bibliophiles will be drawn like magnets or super moths to a hidden flame), but after feeling the calmness of the space and how perfect it is for quiet, leisurely browsing...it makes absolute sense.I left feeling like an initiate into a world of books I never knew truly existed.The volume I left enamoured with?  ""Gaia, Saturn Edition Book by Guy Laliberté | Special Edition Photography Book of Earth From Space | Assouline"" - Guy Laliberté's (founder of Cirque du Soleil) photos of Earth's surface from space.  http://www.assouline.com/9782759405367.htmlDefinitely worth a visit...and more.",1
"New favorite sushi place! The food has AMAZING taste and presentation, you can feel the passion of the chefs. Service was great, very kind and even gave as appetizer and dessert on the house ! Price is just right for the food and service, they deserve the full tip! Thank you guys!",1
They were extremely helpful with our group and it was a ton of fun. The service was great and the manager went out of his way to be helpful.,1
Great food. Great service. Great for a low key night out.  Pig wings were phenomenal. Also had al pastor burritos. Just the right amount of spicy goodness! Great local place on our last night of vacation. Highly recommend!,1
Tried the kiss taco and it was really good and cheap! Shady area but it's worth it. Restaurant is clean and the guy at the counter is friendly and passionate about their food. Great local place and way better than most taco shops near downtown.,1
Simply awesome! Many items on menu with no rice for the diet concious. Will be back:),1
Good escape rooms. Lots of mechanic and effects.Andy is a amazing epic runner host. great group game . lots of sweat. Def recommended !,1
I have drive past this place dozens of times! Finally decided to stop in. Food and service were great. Will be back!,1
"I found Elements Therapeutic Massage online, based strictly on geography. When I called to inquire about an appointment I was greeted politely and professionally, and my appointment was booked quickly. Upon my arrival I was again greeted and provided with new client paperwork. The facility is quiet and serene, well-decorated and maintained. My Therapist Clare was very communicative, asking about my preferences in terms of style of massage as well as degree of pressure. We discussed my experience with massage, and any problem areas or old injuries. The massage itself was the best massage I have ever received, and I have been a proponent of massage therapy for over a decade. My session started and ended on time (crucial for anyone on a tight schedule...which is almost everyone), and I look forward to my next session at Elements. There was no part of this experience with which I could find fault, and I give both Clare and Elements Massage of Summerlin the highest possible recommendations.",1
"The BEST poke is in all of Phoenix. The food is always fresh, always flavorful and is the perfect amount. I love that Koi Poke has 3 size options instead of 2. All of the toppings are delicious, fresh and the staff is always willing to give you the perfect amount of what you need. The staff is so friendly and helpful. I have not only never had a bad service experience at Koi Poke, but also every time I've been, the service is beyond expectations - phenomenal. I will always choose Koi Poke over here ya competitors because the food and the experience are valuable.",1
"The R&R race was a great opportunity for a family and friends reunion. Now that most of us were going separate ways we needed a location for one last breakfast and The Orange Table was perfect. The reviews mentioned it being a small locale so I made reservations but on MLK holiday we were the only ones at 8:30 am. We are an eclectic group, as was our breakfast selections. Omletes, waffles and scrambles, tea, chai, coffee, latte and my Bloody Mary. Our only complaint was the Latte was barely warm. We declined their offer for another, my wife finished it without telling anyone, but they removed the charge from our ticket. If I come back here to race next year it will be a Go-to place.",1
"We come to Scottsdale/Desert Ridge once a year.   I wait to have my nails done once I am here so I can enjoy M3V Nail Bar.  It is clean, friendly, and a very pleasant experience.",1
"Just called, haven't been in yet, but heading that way. So far, they are THE nicest on the phone, and very patient!Ok; update!AWESOME AWESOME! Service right away, attention to detail, great price and my son's birthday shirt was a total hit!",1
"Came here on a Friday evening, the restaurant was packed but we were seated right away. The atmosphere of the place was the right blend of cozy, swanky and mozzarell-y. Our waitress Krishta(?) was delightful and had great recommendations. Looking forward to my next visit!",1
"Went for brunch and mimosas and loved the place! It's a super cute vibe, food was delicious, and server was great.",1
"We went to this urgent care yesterday. I did the web check in thinking that we would have to wait for a long time. A staff called us to confirm the check in. when we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly staff at the desk. Registration was quick and was charged a pretty reasonable copay amount, cheaper than most places we've been to. The place is nice and clean. We didn't wait a long time to be called in by a nice guy nurse (sorry I'm really bad with names I couldn't remember the names of everyone we encountered). He took VS, asked questions and was very patient with our 22 month old son. Then he was seen by the NP right away who was also very nice. She saw our kid and gave proper diagnosis and med that he needs to get better. She demonstrated kindness and patience considering that young kids do not really know what goes on when they go to the doctor. We had a good experience there and will definitely go back there if we need to. Today we got a call from a staff checking if everything was ok and if we got my son's Prescription and if we had any questions or concerns to call them. I think that's really good customer service, I also work in the medical field and that is one of the things that's very important, quality patient care and customer service go hand in hand. Good Job CareMore staff!",1
"Barry is one of the best salesmen I have worked with. He had exactly what we were looking for in several varieties to choose from. He took his time answering our questions, and we never felt rushed. After seeing what a nearby store had to offer, I'm so happy we gave this store a try, before settling on a brand name suit for the same price and much better quality. His prices really can't be beat, I googled the suit that we purchased and found it hundreds of dollar higher, even more than twice as much in department stores. If you want to look your best, while staying in budget, look no further, this is the place.",1
"This place is a mechanic shop that takes care of their customers and are top notch. I purchased a boat and had some issues come up. I took it into them and they took great care of me, communicated with me about the issues, and helped me get it taken care of fast and prompt. Their shop rate is a great price as well! I will be going back for years to come! I suggest them to anyone that owns a boat",1
"Good 4 beers on tap brewed on site, classic dark long bar, but a great beer garden out back! Many other tap beers to choose from",1
"I like this place! They have really great specials sometimes and their beer and wine list is great. A very fun, friendly neighborhood place to have a good time with friends or family.My only complaint is how very little parking there is for this little shopping center and how tight the parking lot is. Getting in and out is really difficult.",1
"As an attorney, there is no firm I would rather send my own case to than Valiente Mott. Mike and Tim work their tails off to get the best results for their clients.Sure enough, that's exactly what they did for me when I sent them my own motorcycle accident case. Needless to say, these guys are very smart. But, what separates them is their unparalleled dedication to customer service. I hope to never be in an accident again. But, if I ever am, I know I'm calling Mike and Tim.",1
"I'm always down for brunch but can't bear weekend crowds. Having brunch on a weekday is something thing I can dig. Discovered by my girl on IG, I was hesitant to make the trek across town from Bellwoods to Leslieville with so many options in our hood. The girl is always boss so off we went.Entered to a typical hipster aesthetic and your tatted beardman that lives on his triumph. He approached with a gracious and polite demeanour. +1. Scanned the menu to find the most uncommon of items. Suspecting I now may have been conned into an over-stylized organic veggie cliche, I went for the Dinette Brekkie. No meat included and no bacon option (I'm your robot brunch type) so I ordered a side of sausage. A couple of fresh-pressed juices to start and Fried Chicken and Buckwheat Pancakes for the wifey.While waiting, took a closer look at the decor. First off, I was getting up on the sketch and water color stroke drawings that lined the wall and menu. The retro cameras, chair bar. All looking good and worthy of a cam pic.The food arrived and my fears continued... All looking too  veggie hipster for me. Smaller than avg components. Touch of pea sprouts for colour. Eggs pre-peppered.  Uh oh.  Plating for both our dishes was pic worthy so out with the phone cams again. Click click. Time to eat.SO.  No idea why, but I started with the grilled tomato.  Usually not my first target. This is where the journey really began for me.I cut a piece off the first tomato and put it down.  Now, I'm really not a foodie nor do I care to advertise my outings, BUT... The tomato hit my mouth and there was a rush of flavours that hit me. My eyes rolled back and then began to tear. WTF just happened? I moaned, then cursed. THIS WAS THE BEST DAM TOMATO I'VE EVER HAD. I was experiencing emotions I haven't had since I was building snowforts in my backyard as a child. It's only just a tomato but it moved me like the lady eating that cake in Matrix 2. Then I hit the toast. Texas cut. Toast is toast, until I put that drop of fruity jam or compote. OMG. Best dam jam I ever ate. Everything else just became a blur of bliss, but if a tomato and jam can inspire me to write my first post, then u catch my drift. The food for this dude was interstellar. I won't go into the Fried Chicken and pancakes. Try it for yourself. While settling up the bill, I take a loving look at a stack of books beside the cameras. One is about afro-vegan cuisine. Another is from Cafe Boulud. I get it.The bearded man. His name is Johnny and he's a sweetheart and loving and willing to serve.All the stars align at Saturday Dinette. The decor matches the mood that matches the food. It's all real. No cliche here.",1
"It is difficult to explain in words what makes Ichiza so special.  When you walk in the doors of the small, upstairs restaurant, you immediately feel a sense that this restaurant is special.  If you ask any chef or cook in Las Vegas where they would go if you gave them an unlimited feeding spree, they would undoubtedly pick Ichiza.  Sure, you may get a better ""value"" by going to one of the overpriced places on the strip, but no where else could you receive the variety, quality, and uniqueness other than Ichiza.  The menu is astronomically large.  In fact, most of the menu is posted on the walls around the restaurant.  I have been to Ichiza well over 50 times, and I can honestly say I haven't tried most of the things on the menu itself, I get most of the dishes off the wall.  That's not to say I haven't had most of the things, because our table is usually filled with 10-15 different items at a time, and our palates are always interested in the new items Ichiza puts up.Before going to Ichiza, there is something everyone should understand.  This is not a sushi restaurant.  Yes, Ichiza does have sushi.  They will make you basically anything you want.  But if you want to see 40 menu items that interchange random types of fish together in different ways that have no distinction from the other (much like most sushi restaurants), then this is not your place.  But, if you're looking for one of the best and most unique dining experiences you will ever have while trying new things, you should definitely go to Ichiza.  Ichiza is ""Izakaya"" style Japanese cuisine.  While it's hard to define Izakaya, the easiest way to understand it is to think of Japanese Tapas.  Small plates served in a family-style setting focusing on Japanese cuisine is what Ichiza is about.  If for some reason God (or whoever you believe in) came down and told you that you were not allowed to order more than one thing at Ichiza, you should, hands-down, order the Yellowtail Sashimi.  For $11.95, you get 5 thick slices of the best Yellowtail you will ever have served on fresh shiso leaf.  I'm not joking, this WILL be the best yellowtail you have ever had.  Unless you are literally a fish monger in Osaka, you will not find better yellowtail.  Other items that are musts at Ichiza:- Salmon sashimi-Pork wrapped in shiso leaf skewers-Kimchi Fried Rice-Ikayaki: Grilled squid served with ginger.  Simple, yet amazing.  -Beef Tongue Stew-Boiled Pork Belly-Ramen DX: Giant bowl of ramen with pork belly and egg.  Very tasty.  -Rare Organic Pork Steak: Lightly breaded pork, slightly seared and topped with Japanese eggplant.  - Skewers of: Garlic, Shishito Peppers, Chicken, Beef Tongue, Corn.  - Dice Cut Beef Steak: Sauteed beef cubes with garlic and shallots.  - Stir Fried Bacon Potato: Potatoes, bacon, corn, garlic, white wine, and stock sauteed together.  one of the least Japanese influenced dishes on the menu.  - Sake Marinated Salmon Collar- Miso-glazed Black Cod- Beef Tataki- Honey Toast:  YOU MUST GET THIS!  Freshly baked sweet bread loaf topped with honey, butter, and ice cream.  I have taken over 20 people to this place, all with different personalities, and EVERY one of them loves it.  If you don't like this dish, you should probably go get your head checked out because something wrong is happening inside of your brain.  The most expensive item on the menu is the Toro sashimi for around $18.  Other than the sashimi's, most of the items on the menu are between $2- $8.  The way to order is to start off ordering a lot of stuff, and eventually your table will be filled with lots of small plates.  It makes for a very social eating environment, and a very fun time.  Oh ya, and did I mention that it's open til 3 AM.  Go here... right now. I mean it, NOW!",1
"Meital is truly a great agent. It's a pleasure to work with her. I'm currently looking for a home and she always sends me great points to research and various other tips. While my search isn't over, I trust I'll find a home in the massively competitive Bay Area market under Meital's guidance.One of things that attracted me to Meital is her nonchalant attitude towards writing offers. Initially not knowing how the pricing in the Bay Area worked, I often offered much too less. Previous agents I worked with would not even write the offer for me, which was somewhat annoying considering I simply wanted to test the waters as I was new to the market. I gave Meital a low price to write and she didn't mind writing it even though she recommended offering a little more. It's the down-to-earth aspect that I like about Meital. She always easy to converse with over phone and email.Having been turned down on a couple of offers, now with Meital, I feel like I'm battle-hardened and a more informed buyer. I am highly recommending her if you are currently looking to buy in the East Bay. A+++++!",1
"New owners renamed our beloved Pin Kaow to SIAMESE BISTRO. Same chef, same recipes, same lovely staff. I've been coming here for over five years and was happy to see that our favorite restaurant remained unchanged. Excellent food, as always, and friendly staff!  We had Panang Curry w/chicken, Pad Thai, and Pot Stickers today. Other favorites are the Crying Tiger Beef and Tom Yum Soup.",1
"All their dishes are very good. We had Octopus Terrain for app, mushroom truffles ravioli and chicken roti for main. It tastes amazing and perfectly cook. The ravioli infused with truffle flavour and the chicken was juicy and tender. Definitely coming back.",1
"This place is very solid. I have been ordering here for two years ,Its definitely  one of those places where you can eat everything on the menu and be confident that it will be good. They are very consistent, portions are great. The girls taking the orders are wonderful in being precise and always nice . I've NEVER had a call- in mess up. It is clean, and the ingredients are fresh. When I have ordered salads that have avocados I'm always very impressed how much of the real avocado they give you ,not this guacamole moosh everyone sells as avacados.  The breakfast burritos are amazing, salads all great. I love the tuna salad. Mediterranean omlette is just fabulous! This place had a good sugar free vanilla latte they make that is really good and creamy, AND above all fair pricing.",1
"New coffee place. Excellent simple sandwiches and very good iced coffee drinks - perfect for an afternoon snack when the Summer temps are pushing 110! Helpful, friendly staff. Free WiFi and USB chargers in the plentiful wall outlets! Nice job, folks!",1
Great Store. Tim and Bill are awesome. Far more helpful than most shoe stores. By all means this is the 'to go to' shop for your running or sneaker purchases. I'm not a runner by any means and these guys are terrific and knowledgeable. Couldn't be happier with the service they offer. 5 stars.,1
"This is our other go to place for sushi. The garlic ponzu sauce they use on the playboy and playgirl rolls is to die for. The server always remembers us and brings our usual drinks. Always a nice touch when you get personalized service. Although they don't usually have any sashimi specials, the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are very creative and delicious!",1
"I came here after I was given a gift certificate. And I can honestly say I don't think I have ever had such a relaxing afternoon in my life. I cannot stop raving about this place to everyone! The staff were all lovely. The drinks were superb. The RMT was knowledgeable, and took the time to review some stretches with me afterwards. Will definitely be back! Can't wait for the new location!",1
"A beautiful dining experience in a superb location in downtown Champaign...from the tin ceilings and the wine barrel ring lights to the repurposed barn-wood walls and cathedral stain glass windows...this all sets the perfect surrounding to compliment with the ""which item on the menu do I order!?"" So far you CAN'T go wrong with any thing that lists Pork Belly...crisp and BACONY!! The Salmon is of a generous portion cooked to perfection! No flaws in any of the culinary skills that go on in the kitchen...can't wait for my next visit again, and again!",1
We loved the patio almost as much as the pizza. The staff was very friendly too. I can't wait to go back. A great little find in this area.,1
My favorite store! Love how you can use your spin to win coupon even toward something that's on sale. Most of my home decor comes from this place.,1
"Took the Grand Canyon Explorers tour. Because the 8am tour was fully booked, I ended up on the 2pm tour. Got picked up at my hotel around 12:45. The staff were all very nice and helpful.The pilots called us together a few minutes before 2pm to give us instructions for the flight. Tom and Charlie were very nice, very professional, and very gorgeous. That last part was definitely a nice bonus. The plane has seating that offers views for everyone and after the plane gets higher than 10,000 feet, Tom & Charlie invited us to visit them in their cockpit to take pictures. I was too scared to leave my seat during the trip going to the canyon, but did take advantage of the invitation on the return flight. Absolutely stunning views, especially because it was sunset by the time we headed back to Las Vegas. Tom & Charlie took pictures for me of the views and even took pictures with me. They were great in pointing out landmarks we could see outside of the windows.In Tusayan, we were met by the tour bus operator, Marion. Besides the dry jokes, he was awesome! Gave clear instructions. We spent about an hour at Bright Angel Lodge and about 45 minutes at Mather Point. When you're intent on taking as many pictures of the canyon as I was, that 1 hr 45 min goes by rather quickly especially after stopping to eat some of the boxed lunch that's included in the tour.I would absolutely recommend the 2pm Explorers tour. You'll be able to take pictures pretty close to sunset which makes for awesome photographs. Definitely take a camera. Your cellphone just won't capture the Grand Canyon adequately. Of course, I'm not sure any camera could adequately capture the beauty of the canyon.",1
The Phó is excellent and the egg rolls are AMAZING!!  The atmosphere is very inviting and the staff are friendly and courteous!  We will definitely be back!,1
Been coming here for 20 years. Owners have always hired great people. Honest shop.  Never been disappointed.,1
"The most awesome Sushi place in Vegas. The ""all you can eat"" option is just brilliant.",1
"Wanted to treat myself after a half marathon, and this place was perfect for it! It is in such a cool area near downtown... we loved the outdoor seating area under the trees.  I had a doughnut stuffed with butter pecan ice cream and it was to me a perfect combination of flavors and textures... it was truly delicious!",1
"This location is the best maternity store I have been to offering selections in varying price ranges.  The staff are very nice and helpful, they even give you water if you want while your browse.  Also there is a spa inside that specializes in prenatal massages.  I took advantage of this twice when I was pregnant and once postnatal and was very pleased every time I went.  The service by the specialists was beyond amazing (they even sent me a card in the mail).  When you go into the spa you forget that you are in a maternity clothing store, it is so calming.  I recommend this place for every pregnant woman in the Charlotte area.",1
"Most definitely an 'ultimate buffet dining experience'. This buffet has everything my little heart could ever desire. The brunch is wonderful, especially with the all- you-can drink Mimosas(hiccup!). HUGE props for  the Mediterranean bar and the lox bagel sandwich bar. Top notch service. C'mon, what is Vegas without a buffet?",1
They are fast considering how busy they are. Excellent customer service skills and quality work.,1
"Best boba/tea in Vegas. One of my personal top boba places of all time. Wide range of selections, not an overwhelming menu, very easy to customize to your preferences (amount of ice, sweetness level, non-dairy options, toppings). The tea is fresh and flavorful and the boba is soft and chewy. Reasonable price point around $4 for a regular size and $5 for a large. Definitely recommend.",1
I love this UPS store.Everyone is very nice and professional.In and out service .i use them for a lots of printing on the different posters and I just email the image .When I get there is already  ready for me to pick up exactly the way I like it .Highly recommended!!!!,1
"Fantastic food, fast service, and they were great with our 16-month old. Highly recommend. Mango tuna, sex and the city, and spider rolls were awesome.",1
"Been going to the Ahwatukee location near my work for years so was pretty excited when I saw this new location opening up right down the street from my house!!  Everything at this location is spot on, true to the original and definitely a welcome addition to the area which is sorely lacking when it comes to authentic Mexican fast casual options.  If you are not familiar with this local chain, give them a shot ASAP.  I would highly recommend the taco plate, that's my go to but you can't go wrong with the other items on the menu either.",1
"2nd time coming here and I love it! Great food, great service, and clean! First time I enjoyed the 3 meal combo special. 2nd time we did Family style plate for 4 people. I just loved the flavors and how fresh it tasted. Hummus is a must...they make it right! The lentil soup is perfect...especially now that's fall season. Salad is so fresh! Portion is more than enough and so worth it. Give it a try and you won't regret it.",1
"We had our cool decking and patio painted by Desert Mesa Painting yesterday and the job they did was amazing! Desert Mesa Painting exceeded my expectations by a long way with the results and the way the cool decking turned out. I was not expecting their attention to detail with the way they sealed around the edges, house and pool, it looks perfect, I love the color we picked and highly recommend Desert Mesa Painting! Thank you!",1
"After finding out I had insurance money to spend on massage I booked two appointments back to back. It was my first time getting a professional massage so take this review with a grain of salt but this place is the bomb dot com. Service is excellent (somehow even the cleaning lady called me by my name) and the facilities are beautiful. My first massage was a 60 min aromatherapy massage. My massage therapist was extremely professional and took the time to explain everything. My second massage was the Asian fusion massage which didn't seem much too different from the aromatherapy one besides some added tapping and slapping techniques. My therapist also didn't seem as professional or talented as the first, so your experience might depend on who you get. I recommend coming here 1.5-2 hours before to get into the zone, explore the facilities or relax in the lounge with tea.",1
"Darn. I noticed a lot of frustrated reviewers here. I'll have to stop by more often to text it out, because those are some serious problems that they were referencing. It's a smaller Wal-mart. My needs tonight were simple and quick so I came, got what I needed and got out of there. I have to give them a 5 cause for me they had everything I needed. I'll have to visit a couple more times and see if what the other reviewer showed is a consistent problem. I'll keep my review for now but if what they referenced happens to me?...uh oh....I'll have to update my review.",1
"First off, this place is amazing.   Second,  Crystal the magician really blew my...mind!  Awesome",1
Love the entire chain. This is an older location but still a wonderful workout and atmosphere.,1
I have been to this location many times. The customer service has always been consistent and honest. They also have a good selection to choose from.Would definitely reccomend this store.,1
"Any place! I mean any place that can have over a 100 could beers on tap at gets 5 big stars in my book! The food here is good, but who comes here focused on that! It the biggest selection in the world in choosing beers! Great place!!",1
"Clean and sanitized extremely well that's why I come here! Not to mention ventilation is awesome, never smell chemicals. I get my mani pedi and etc done by jennifer :) she's awesome! I like the chairs mucho theyre by far the best chairs I've sat in as far as pedicure chairs. Quiet and relaxed. Love them!",1
"Great show, we had a lot of fun. He keeps you guessing the whole time. It's a small venue so you feel more involved. You can find deals on tickets, just ask around.",1
"I'm not going to lie, I was prepared for wedding dress shopping to be tedious and aggravating. Brilliant bridal made it anything but that! My stylist, Alex, took my vision and helped me find and create the perfect expression of myself in my wedding dress. I felt heard and connected. She was brilliant and we had an absolute blast! I'd absolutely recommend this boutique to any of my girlfriends. Everyone was incredibly helpful and kind and made me feel amazing! I loved my experience here.",1
"Mind. Blowing. What an amazing meal - Maha's deserves all the stars on Yelp, all the praise already garnered from blogTO, and so much more. I'm glad we had a chance to come here and experience Maha's brilliance for ourselves!We arrived on a Saturday morning for brunch at 9:25 AM, and it was already packed. We were told it would only be a 30-40 minute wait but, turns out that a table for 2 was available sooner and we only waited about 15 minutes! Not a bad wait at all for a table for 2. Although, note that if you're with a bigger group, the wait can be longer - seating is super limited, and there was a group of 4 who had been waiting over an hour!Food is fresh and the hot drinks were so wonderful. We ordered: a) the Sunny Eggs and Foule ($11), b) Maha's Mind Blowing Chicken Sandwich ($8), c) a small Honey Cardamom Latte ($4.25), and d) a small Egyptian Black Tea with fresh mint ($2.50). First off, the drinks were amazing - the tea tasted so fresh and the mint really gave it a nice kick. The latte was also very soft and smooth, without the burnt coffee bean aftertaste I was afraid it would have. The beans used were top notch. Next... the food. Wow. So unique, so tasty. Both dishes were absolutely fantastic and you can't go wrong with either. The chicken in the sandwich was full of flavour, with a great combination of seasonings. The Sunny Eggs and Foule was very light but filling and an absolute pleasure to eat. The home fries were super soft, light, with an earthy and lemony taste to it - everything was spectacular, and our meal couldn't have been better.The restaurant is very small and seats no more than 20-22 people, although even that might be pushing it. But, the place is absolutely charming, eclectic decorations (some of which came straight from Cairo), and a wonderful rustic yet family-friendly ambiance. Service was also so incredibly friendly - thanks so much to Mark and Hannah for being so warm and welcoming.For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to $38. A super unique brunch for the ages - Maha's is a gem, and Toronto is lucky to have it.",1
I received wonderful service from start to finish.   My yard looks amazing.  I had my backyard landscaped and they do my pool and lawn service.   They show up the same day and around the same time every week.,1
"Good food and good service. They blast the AC inside, which is nice when it's 110 degrees outside. It's also nice because you don't smell too much like kimchi afterwards. However, they do not offer sushi/rolls on weekends, which I thought was weird.Jun's special was pretty good and very filling; it comes with bulgogi, grilled chicken, kalbi, mandu, and fried pork. My favorite is definitely the kalbi tang. It's not too salty, but still flavorful. I prefer my soups not too salty and msg-free. The meat is very tender and the broth is delicious. I will definitely be back for more kalbi tang.",1
"I went last night after the Knights game, food was great and there was a great atmosphere as well. Really enjoyed the pizza, would recommend the mighty meaty if you are hungry!",1
"Starting off. My boyfriend told me he was going to take me a steak house and I wasn't in the mood to really have steak. He was like cmon, the guy at the table said it's really good. Really good in this high class five star restaurant is an understatement!!!! This place was fantastic amazing sexy, I could go on. Our waitress Jessica was a doll she was helpful in our order on what to recommend. The portions here are totally shareable ! Like seriously. We ordered a glass of wine, and  a Kentucky buck mixed drink. The braised beef stroganoff and a wedge salad all shared with my boyfriend. More then enough food to share plus they give you a huge portion of bread and the most butteriest butter I have ever had. Let's go back to the Cobb salad. The house made dressing was ranch and a thick juicy oily amazing mouthwatering piece of bacon I've even had. The blue cheese MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH, and the eggs were Devine. Next about 10 min later the beef braised stroganoff came out that had been marinated for over 24 hours. With homemade egg noodles and thick mushrooms in a decadent white cream truffle sauce. With lots of love on top. Let me just tell you how mouthwatering that braised beef was- it melt in your mouth. It literally melts the second you taste it and all that yummy goodness filled with flavor drips down your throat like heaven with those fresh noodles and a mushroom on top!!!! It's the best I have ever had. And I've been to a lot of steak houses in my life. You will not be disappointed if you choose to come here. I promise. We will c me back. Next time with the whole family. The ambiance is very vintage and Hefner style. Dress up!!! Very old Vegas classic lighting. But dark in here. Classic old chandeliers as well you will not be disappointed for a first date anniversary special night. This is the place to be at on any day of the week for a pick me up!!",1
i trust these friendly guys with my auto service need,1
"Great hummus and even better pita bread! i have been here several times and will keep coming back for 2 reasons- the food AND the customer service. Although I can only comment on the hummus since that is all I ever order. It's fresh and you get a lot of it.  It's obvious they make the hummus and pita right there. The owner has been there everytime I have been there (he must work everyday), and he has always provided excellent customer service.I didn't go into this restaurant at first because I never liked Red Brick Pizza (which was what was there before), and I didn't realize it had changed it's menu sincee it looks pretty much the same. However, it's not a chain restaurant being run by teenagers!",1
"As I was walking past another dog, my dog, Dok, stared at me lovingly, walking right by my side. There was no pulling, no barking, no lunging. This would not have possible just one year ago. I realized that I completely forgot to thank the people responsible for this; Caryn and Mirkka. They both taught me what to do when in stressful situations (my first reaction is to panic).They were both very calm and patient, explaining everything step by step and always ready to answer questions. I really appreciate that they don't judge you for having a dog that isn't well behaved. All the classes were stress free, fun, and a great time to bond with my dog. Thank you!",1
"Their services are great, fast and they're very respectful! Jonathan was honest and very professional! He seemed very busy but it didn't take as long as I thought it would be. I will be back as soon as I need more work done on my car (hopefully not too soon :) Keep up the good work guys. Thank you.",1
"This place is to be honest, amazing. They not only found the problem with my desktop they went the extra mile to make my computer run faster and more efficiently by tweaking all of the things that I did not know how to do. Great staff, friendly funny and accommodating to say the least. And oh yeah, the store mascot , the cute litle dog running around is a bonus for sure. I suggest these guys 100%.",1
"Came in after a night at Teharu and this place was poppin'. And even though they don't offer smoothies, they have mochi!!!Of course I went straight for the red velvet, but I added a few globs of dulce de leche and peanut butter, and tons of mochi.I'm sorry Mojo, but Zoyo is my new yogurt lover.",1
"Out of all the crab shacks I've been to here in Arizona Angry Crab is the best one. I ordered the king crab which was 30$ a pound, Cajun fries with gumbo, & cornbread. Everything was delicious and satisfied my pregnancy cravings lol! My waitress Shawna was amazing & gave good customer service for it being busy on a Saturday night.",1
"The most amazing farmer's market I've ever been too.  I love to spend an early Saturday morning walking around the square and getting my tax money's worth by using the nicest bathrooms in the state!Check the website to see what's there before going.  Early in the season it's mostly plants, bakery and meats.  Later in July/August it gets better with more produce.  It's always fun to check out though.  Go early to beat the crowds.  After 10:30 it gets difficult to move, much less shop!",1
"Hello improved health!  My wife and I recently started going to Restore Integrative Health and love the service we get there.  Sue, Sapna and Aliyah (the folks we have worked with) have provided us excellent care and a good deal of laughter.  We really appreciate having them in the area. Lastly, I love their space.  It's bright and well-appointed with a good sense of style!",1
Had a great experience here. Staff was quick to tend to us and were very friendly. Food was awesome! The burger I had is probably one of the best tasting burgers I've had in a while. I will definitely be coming back for more!!,1
"Once again great time was had, service great and food consistently good. Would recommend this family restaurant",1
"This is the bakery that serves all the best restaurants and bars in the city. Some great standards in terms of bread. I have had many from the baguette to Rye and many others and they are all great. That is why it has been rated one of the city's best. I haven't eaten any sandwiches yet but look for an updated review when I do. ONE IMPORTANT thing, this is the only place in Montréal that I know of the serves Biolys. Biolys are a New York specialty that are amazing....bagel like bread with an onion centre. I love it! Worth a try. Only a half dozen made each day.",1
"I hired David to video a presentation in Pheonix for a Doctor to present to other physicians. I couldn't have been happier during the process working with him. He was very punctual, organized, and friendly. I had a tight deadline to get back the presentation, which he delivered on and I was thrilled with the results! The recording came out great, high quality, and overall the price for this was worth every penny. I will definitely reach out to AZ Video Marketing for any future events!",1
Momchil is great! I have been going to him for over 3 years and always get compliments after I leave the salon!,1
"Our new apartment is small with only two little closets. I was sceptical that California Closets could improve the situation. The designer Kate did a home visit. No problem. Reconfigured the space and added a wardrobe in the mini second bedroom. A few weeks later Mark came to install them. He was professional, precise and had the place looking like a different home in less than two days!CC is pricey but I'd say it's worth it. The quality and workmanship speak to it. No job is too small. You won't regret the expenditure. Makes life easier. Clothes on the floor is not a good look!The estimate is free. You can go to their shop for ideas if you like.",1
My niece and I meet for lunch every so often and we always choose this Pita Jungle. I have never had bad service or a bad meal there. Love the staff and the food!,1
"In downtown Phoenix for work, wanted to get a good breakfast. This place was just fantastic! Good portions, fresh ingredients, and great service. If I'm ever back in Phoenix again I would absolutely come here for breakfast!",1
"So I've been in Vegas 2 years now and to date this is the best hole in the wall Italian spot I've hit! Everything front to back was on point. As always I like to sample a couple apps at every restaurant I go to. Had the calamari and bruschetta pesto which were both phenomenal fresh and full of flavor. Tried the chicken Marsala with a side of pasta (comes with every dish) the Marsala was quality and reminded me of something home-made. The Pasta was great, bit too much sauce just enough the way I like it. This is a must if you are in the mood for reasonably priced Italian food off the strip!",1
"I love the yard house, especially the 1/2 yard beer pours. We always sit at the huge bar. I have never been disappointed in the food. Always delicious with a opulent presentation.",1
"I just got done with my move, and I couldn't be more impressed with this company and the crew of guys that they sent. Ryan, Steven and Kjeld were super efficient and quick, all while being extremely professional and knowledgeable. They took care of all our stuff like it was their own..... no dings, bumps or scratches on anything!! I can't recommend this company enough. You have a customer for life!! Way to go fellas!!",1
"This park is wonderful! Family friendly and dog friendly with places for the dogs to be both on and off leash. We go here frequently to relax both with and without our furry family member. They have dirt plots for rent, an amphitheater, and the biggest skate park I've seen in Las Vegas. The park is extremely well kept and I have never felt unsafe here. There are all kinds of free events that happen here as well and offer a wealth of things to do near our home including a weekly farmers market! Be sure to give this place a visit.",1
"My family and I love this place.  The atmosphere, food and service are always fantastic.  We really love BBQ and the brisket, ribs and chicken here are all beyond excellent.  When we are looking to eat a bit lighter, The cedar plank salmon is awesome as well.  Oh and don't forget those incredible corn muffins!!  Our favorite server here is Mack.  Mack is an amazingly upbeat friendly person!  She makes us feel like family.  She had actually remembered all of my family's names by the second time we were seated in her area.  Her attentiveness as a server is top notch.  We now specifically ask to be seated in her area when we check in.  Famous Dave's has become our go-to restaurant in the Valley because of  their great food, great service and reasonable prices.",1
This is truly the most calm and positive I've felt in a long time. I finally feel that I can move forward with my life and with others around me. I thank her so much for the understanding and clarity she gives.,1
Always a great experience! The live jazz music was delightful and the food was AMAZING! Get the BBQ Shrimp appetizer and Shrimp and grits for your entree! You will not be disappointed. Will be back again soon!!!,1
"Always one of my go-to's! Menu is extensive, delicious, and well priced. Staff is very friendly. You can't go wrong with this place!",1
Awesome service!! And very fast! I needed my galaxy s6 fixed and he did a awesome job,1
"Used this place for two houses now. They do an awesome professional job. The racks are top notch, prices reasonable, easy to get an appointment. Really helps make the garage easier to use space in  the flooring package is sweet. Floors are professional grade when they are done. Can't say enough good things about this service",1
Yummy!! The sweetOnion jam was the JAM on my beef hotdog  and the roll/bun was unexpectedly good. The service was wonderfully attentive- Lindsey was so friendly!Nice to have food that's HOT and delicious!!Big weenies ARE better,1
"Stopped in for lunch on Friday (so incorrect actually that it says the restaurant is closed until 3). Wonderful atmosphere and food. Not sure of actual dish names as we asked for a recommendation, but I really liked the eggplant and egg appetizer as well as the beef/lamb kebab with rice. Coming back soon!",1
My Wife and I love the food from Garcia's I can't even say enough nice things about the food! not to mention their torilla chips are VERY addicting!!!I highly recommend this place!!,1
"Great steak with very reasonable prices. I had the filet with prawns and 2 sides for $26 what a great value.  Comes with homemade breads and pesto garlic dip, and bacon corn bread.  The only downside is very small restaurant and you can hear the casino slots ringing during your whole meal.  Will be back soon.",1
"I am so grateful for an honest company with integrity!  I have been using Aire Serv for years for units and service. I just had a 25yr old unit replaced and I am so sorry I waited.  As usual, the price was good, the service even better. The guys were efficient, thorough, clean and very nice. Jeremy came by to check progress and bring extra supplies to accommodate my situation. I am extremely happy with the outcome.  The efficiency of these new units is amazing.  My house is so much cooler and my bill is much less than last year!! If you are shopping around, be sure to get a quote from these guys. It will be well worth it.",1
"I'm not sure if there is an Ox, but I know there is most certainly an Angela, and I would like to sincerely thank her for having one of the most fabulous restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of dining at. Eating in this food lover paradise, with the most mouth watering tapas I have found outside of Spain, is just simply a stunning experience. From top-notch service, to the comforting decor and ambiance that makes you feel at ease and special at the same time. Then, there is the food.... I adored the white anchovies, drooled over the salt cod and potato croquettas, ordered seconds of the patatas bravas and will definitely be back for the stuffed Persian dates with serrano, manchego & walnuts. What else can I say. Angela, I've never met you, but hot dam! You are my girl!",1
I have been coming to diva beauty for about two years now and I absolutely love it! Meena does a wonderful job. They also give a complimentary chocolate and water!,1
"I hosted an event at DeSano tonight, and it was terrific! The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the venue was lovely! I can't say enough about how accommodating the team was from the managers to the bartenders to the kitchen staff! Give it a try!",1
"This guy is no joke! He gets the job done while putting a smile on your face.  His videographer counterpart and him made our wedding day stress free and his overall attitude made for a memorable event.  His overall professionalism is superb and if I ever need pictures or videos of any kind in the future, he's our guy without a doubt! The pictures he took that day were magical like he really captured picture perfect moments that I truly believe is his special touch that I kept reading about in his reviews. He is the best especially if you are on a budget but want quality results as well.    Our wedding went better than I could have ever dreamed and the finish product was masterfully retouched capturing the beauty in every moment caught on film.  He was definitely one of the best decisions I made for our wedding!",1
"What better way to start off a vacation than to get an incredible mani pedi??  They had hundreds of colors for me to choose from, and I even saw glow in the dark!  When I chose my colors, she directed me to an incredibly comfortable massage chair and began filling the tub for me to soak my feet.  I chose a pastel pink and a glittery fuchsia nail polish.  Without even asking she made sure to give me an extra coat of polish so that the colors came out incredibly vibrant.  I'm so glad I was able to find this fantastic place that uses 100% vegan products! I considered not going to get my nails professionally done anymore because I recently read an article in the New York Times about toxic chemicals used in nail salons (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/nyregion/nail-salon-workers-in-nyc-face-hazardous-chemicals.html?_r=0)  When I left, I definitely felt like something was different.  That's when I realized I wasn't hit with a smell of chemicals you normally get as soon as you walk through the door of any regular nail salon.  The atmosphere was bright, clean and open.  The people are very friendly and I felt so relaxed the entire time.",1
Love supporting local businesses! Hartley loves Puff n Fluff! He is so handsome after their grooming services!,1
This is a hidden gem in Woodbridge. Pizza is amazing! We ordered the Canadian pizza and it was so good. The crust was thin and all the ingredients came all together to this salty and sweet taste. Will definitely come back.,1
"One of the best hotels to stay at while in Las Vegas. Love that you can go onto the terrace and enjoy the gorgeous view. The inside is amazing and has a high energy feel to the casino. Casino Director of Customer Development Desiree Mullen is one of the best professional hosts we have met in the several years visiting there. Our annual trip is usually at another hotel, but The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas won us over and now is our new go to hotel. WINNER WINNER.",1
"I love this facility!  I have a trainer here four days a week and I wish I had time for more...  The owners Scott and Jake are very friendly and caring.  They will sit down and formulate a meal and fitness regment that will really help you achieve your goals.  I have refered lots of my friends, and will continue too, refer anyone who I think would benefit from such a wonderful place! PS.... Monica is Greatest!",1
"This place is old school Vegas all the way. The prices here are crazy cheap for all that you get. Where else can you go and get a Steak, beer and sides for $8.99... Just crazy prices. What is even more amazing is the food here is great. Everything we tried was top notch and homemade. Even the cheese stix here are homemade and some of the best I have had. The Desserts are great also if you can find a way to have enough room left over to try them. Be sure to try the cheese cake it is great. The cheese cake here is light and fluffy unlike any other cheese cake I have had. The service is also great, Our waiter was very friendly and took his time to let us know all the stuff we should try. Overall very impressed with Ellis Island.",1
Yummy popsicles. Everything tastes fresh and natural. I love the chamoyada with spicy mango!!! Must go to ice cream shop,1
"Josh, Tiago, and the team at The Cooling Company were very professional, courteous, and knowledgable. They were extremely punctual. Even though they didn't have my part in stock, they set me up with a portable cooling unit for the night. Josh was very professional and didn't leave any mess. I'd recommend this company to friends, family, and strangers!",1
The food here is beyond flavorful.  We had the steak kabobs. They were so perfectly cooked. They come with the most flavorful potatoes and a beautiful Greek salad. The hummus and pita bread were so fresh and savory.  But.......those roasted potatoes.....mmmmmmm!I will be back with my foodie family of friends.,1
"A new coffee shop in the King West hood!No seating (well, a small bench inside but winter's coming) but great coffee to go. I really liked my flat white, two espresso blends were available, both roasted by De Mello. A large selection of soft serve with interesting flavours (Lemon Coconut Cream Pie, Rocky Road Rage, Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich). They also serve some paletas for $4.",1
"Jeze Santiago of Barking Dog is an amazing dog trainer.Last February we rescued a sweet little terrier mix we named Mickey from Foothills Animal Rescue where my husband volunteers.Mickey was one and a half years old and the nicest little boy. He bonded to our family quickly but had some very bad behaviors. He barked incessantly at other dogs,  people, birds, lizards just anything that might be a threat to him or us when walking him.We even rescued a second dog in hopes he would feel more secure. The two get along beautifully but Mickey's behavior did not change.We contacted Barking Dog on a recommendation from FAR. Jeze has done wonders with Mickey. We are continuing with a second series of training to insure Mickey's behavior is fixed.He loves playing at the dog park and listens most of the time on walks. Jeze is calm, kind and positive with our little guy. I am confident that this was the best investment to make sure Mickey is a well adjusted member of our family. Sue Steinacher",1
"I was so unfamiliar with the whole process as a medical patient, but was put to ease as I asked questions. Honestly it took 3 trips and plenty of my own research to get the right product. They are a big help and wouldn't go anywhere else. They also offer return discount points.",1
"I kept passing by as I was visiting, and the cakes in the display caught my eye, and  I had to come in.  I ordered a slice of the strawberry shortcake and a slice of the coconut- both were great! I shared with my better half along with coffee, and that was absolutely perfect!Definitely made justice to the eye catching display.  I know they have a full restaurant, but I can not comment on the food, but if you need a great piece of cake- they do a great job!",1
"So been to The Rock twice now, and will tell about both times. Alternatively don't even waste time reading this review just go get yourself a ridiculously tasty burger.First time went in at the end of Nov 2016 with 2 work colleagues and my mom who was visiting from overseas, Had seen great reviews and its not everywhere you can find wild game burgers on offer every day.Mom and I shared the boar and brie burger, which was juicy, flavourful, with just the right amount of brie so that you can taste it with every bite. All their burgers come on a cheese bun which tastes incredibly fresh. We paired our meal with their poutine of the day which was Elk Bacon Poutine with a red wine creamy gravy - of man! What a delicious bile of cheesy saucy potato goodness! Portion was massive too. Even with sharing a burger we couldn't finish it and the other 2 ladies with us had to help out.The other lady with us had the shrimp burger which was a delightful surprise. They finally chop the shrimp and press it together with rice flour I think, to make it all stick together. Still has all the great shrimp flavour. My other coworker went with the boar brie burger too and loved every bite.All agreed we will need to bring the rest of the office back for some tasty burgers. Plus they have wild rose on tap - whats not to love?Second time we went was last week to pick up burgers for dinner. The owner remembered me! Even remembered that I had come in with other people and someone was visiting. Had a nice chat while my burgers were getting ready. This time we got the elk brie burger and the bison brie burger - each had a half and couldn't decide which one we liked more. Also as it was January they had a special on that all their burgers came with free fries.I am not the biggest fan of burgers so they really need to be good for me to rate them highly. The Rock has ruined all other burgers for me. Take everyone you know and go and eat there!Also check out their facebook page as that is where they have their monthly specials, as well as details on special dinners they do which look unreal and I cant wait to try. Amazing value for money + supporting a small local business at the same time = winning at food!",1
"Love this place!  Great food, great prices, friendly staff.  Wish they offered a gyro omelet with home fries for late night eating, with all of the bars around, they would clean up.  Try the pyro gyro or the Rueben gyro, delicious!",1
"My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Amazing food, ambience, and impeccable service. Expensive but well worth every penny. Great for a special occasion or just a great night out with a loved one.",1
First time visiting Corsa Meccanica (out of necessity for Eni oil and an OEM filter for my Tuono) and was honestly pleasantly surprised by their hospitality. I've heard nothing but bad things about this place but George went out of his way to introduce himself to me and my girlfriend to make us feel welcomed. I really like the shops ambiance as well! Good experience!,1
"We were there for a conference this past week. Monday evening around 8pm we were starving coming out of a cocktail reception and I called to see if they could seat a party of 7 and no problem. Our waiter was so personable and attentive, food was delicious!",1
"Such a great hotel. Has everything you need to keep you on the property: outstanding food and drink options, large/clean/newer hotel rooms with great views of the Bellagio Fountains and strip, multiple swimming pools, etc. The rooms and property as a whole are full of unique pieces of artwork and show attention to detail. At this point, I cant imagine staying somewhere else.Even the most basic rooms are good size...larger than your typical hotel rooms. We were offered an upgrade (Marriott Gold), but it would have been to a one bedroom suite without a Fountain View, so we declined in favor of watching the fountains from our balcony.My only complaint was that table minimums here were consistently higher than all other places on the strip. Even when I went down to the casino at 6 am, the single craps table that was open was a $25 minimum and nobody was playing. I was fully ready to play some $15 tables, but nothing was available...craps, blackjack, or otherwise, and the casino was very slow at that point. I ended up doing most of my gambling at other casinos. I'm a $10 - $15 table guy.We were also there during one of the spring break weeks, and this is definitely the place that the college kids hang out at.A few tips about being a Marriott Rewards member, because I had no idea: as mentioned above, I asked at check in if we could be upgraded as a Marriott Gold member, and they obliged, but we declined the room type. Also, there is a VIP lounge just to the left of the back entrance that we could have used to check in, rather than standing in the regular line. Unfortunately, we didn't find out about this until we waited about 15 minutes in the lobby to check in. Lastly, you can convert your Identity Rewards points to Marriott points after your stay. I haven't done this yet, but you can do it through the Marriott Rewards website.We cant wait until our next trip back to the Cosmopolitan!",1
"LGO is my favorite pizza of all time.  I've had many-a-good-pizza in my day, and been to some places that I thought were my favorites, until I had this little joint 7 years ago when they first opened.  His first year, the owner did $1M in food cost, because he really cares about the ingredients and the items they use.  It's all extremely high quality products.  They buy and import huge $500 wheels of Reggiano Parmesan cheese that the servers will put on some of your pizza if you so wish.  Everything about this really modern place screams quality.The Gladiator is my favorite, which is Pepperoni and Sausage, and consists of this locally made Sausage called ""Schreiners Sausage.""  Some of the best Ive ever had.  Fennel gives it a great little kick, and is extremely cravable.  The Shrimp Ceviche is absolutely amazing.  Flavorful, and tasty and I don't even like avocado, but for some reason this I can eat.Then, when finished you've GOT to go next door to the Market, and get a few ""Ooey Gooey"" Cupcakes made by a talented woman named Tammie Coe who does excellent cakes and other droolable sweet baked goods.This is in my opinion, the best Pizza you will find in the valley.  Look at all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I'm not the only one that thinks so ;)",1
"Really impressed with this place! Two of us shared two empanadas, two pieces of chicken (drumstick and breast), two bao, and pickles. This entire meal for two came to less than $15 and was perfectly filling. The chicken pieces are generous and the breading is delicious. I like that the chicken is sourced from a local Amish farm. We tried the chimichurri sauce (amazing) and the ginger soy (very tasty). At 4:30 on a Sunday it was pretty slow and well-stocked. I would have happily waited for such delicious cheap food. Looking forward to returning to this gem.",1
"These guys truly do preserve sanity when moving.   We've used them three times now!   Once for our office and once for our home and once for our parent's home.   They are efficient, polite and some of the hardest workers ever!   I highly recommend using them and will use them again and again and again!  Thanks Camelback Moving!",1
"It was very convenient that I was able to setup an appointment online on the day of. I went in for a tire rotation around 5:30, they were pretty busy, and they close at 6. They stayed after closing to finish my car as well as the handful of other waiting customers. They also discovered a nail in one of my tires. They rotated and repaired while I waited for about 45 minutes. I wasn't charged anything as I bought my tires from a Discount Tire store.Bonus: my tpms is no longer on. They have complimentary cold water bottles.",1
"Great customer service - both in the store & with the delivery people.  Polite & pleasant.  Wanted to make sure everything was arranged how I wanted it.  No, this isn't cheap patio furniture - it's furniture that is meant to last for years. If you shop to catch one of their sales, you can get a discount, & often free delivery.  I special-ordered the cushions to match chairs purchased a few  years before.  Couldn't be happier with the furniture or the customer service received.  Highly Recommend Today's Patio - they strive for customer satisfaction.",1
"Review is a little more towards 4.5 stars for me~Items sampled were 30 Hour Sous Vide Berkshire Pork Belly, Black Bean Sauce Noodle, Beef Tataki, Chicken Pottage, and Spicy Chicken Thigh, in that order.Moko is the newest take on Modern Asian Fusion, though in this case it is a twist on Korean food. I haven't sampled much fusion Korean, but this first foray had some excellent flavors and the execution of each dish was spot on.My personal favorite was the Pork Belly - it was tender, but the fat from the pork belly was not too powerful like in some variations. While the portion is quite small for a 13 dollar price point, the tastes are top notch. In my How Korean Is It scale (HKII), I'd say it was a 5/10. Bonus points for the little roasted veggies and the underlying mung bean crepe. This could be served at any high-end restaurant, as far as I'm concerned.The Black Bean Noodle was another excellent tasting dish, though this one was more in line with its roots. I'd say it's like an HKII 8/10. I was slurping up all the sauce afterwards too. This one is a little heartier than some of the meat-only dishes.Next followed the Beef Tataki which had some very tender and moist slices of high quality meat. This one wasn't particularly memorable to me for some reason, but everything about it tasted great and the presentation was good too. HKII 6/10.The Chicken Thigh was probably where I had the most to be picky about - Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent piece of chicken thigh, cooked to be moist and tender and the sauce is quite tasty. It just lacked some substance - maybe a breading or if it was served with a tiny bit of starch or veggies even. The sauce puts this at HKII 4/10.I enjoyed the Chicken Pottage quite a bit - it was the heartiest and most filling dish of the evening and had some very good flavor to it. Even for a porridge, it looked impressive to me visually. I don't remember the last time I had Samgyetang so I can't really judge on How Korean It Is... But my guess would have been like a 6/10. I would definitely tell a person going here not to expect traditional Korean food but a modern take on fusion. I'm looking forward to trying out some more of the flavors here as a lot of them were nuanced and complex, compared to your typical Korean dishes.While I felt my meal was very satisfying to my taste buds, I did feel like I wanted more - now given I was sharing with two other people we could have certainly tried some more but we decided to save it for the next trip. If there was one thing I could suggest for the menu, I'd like some more heartier options (almost like a filler!) Moko is a Tapas bar, and Tapas often means you always have the option of paella and such, so having like a shared bowl of ""modern"" bibimbap or something might be a fun twist on that idea.Price adds up here, but not so much more than a typical tapas place with a very high quality. I felt the effort put into each dish, and the plating pictures on the Yelp are not dolled up at all. Big props to the chef for that and I hope the quality remains!",1
"Dined on a Monday evening during restaurant week. Can't believe it took this long and restaurant week to get me to try Heirloom. I think the distance has always kept me away. However, it really isn't that far. Uptown peeps it's 15 minutes. Took me 20 minutes from the Steele Creek area on 485. Don't let the perceived distance keep you away. Enough about that, on the to the experience. Exterior looks like an old Calabash seafood place. Inside has been updated and is very welcoming. We were greeted promptly and taken to our seats. Wasn't busy at all but it was also early, 630. The server was very knowledgeable of the menu for Restaurant Week as well as explained the 12 course meal. We all made selections from R.W menu. I had the cucumber tomato salad, the scallops and the blueberry jelly roll. It was all delicious!  The presentation was great. The timing was spot on. Oh. Forgot to mention the freshly chopped herbs for the olive oil paired with the freshly baked bread that was prepared table side. That might not be necessary but a nice touch. Everything is local which is awesome.  This place is legit. Make the small ride and you will not be disappointed.",1
Such a nice and unique restaurant. The tapas are great and waiters are too. One of my favorite places in Cleveland and great place to visit on the eastside.,1
"Great food and service, had the tofu with veggies it was perfect, my friend had sesame chicken he also agreed very good food and service had lunch specials and was not over priced ,",1
Update on my broken firing pin.  Brandi responded to my query and promised to send me a new firing pin.  That was two weeks ago and I haven't received it.  I sent a follow up and have received no reply.  A complaint has been filed with the Az Attorney General.,0
Paid $65 with tip can you see the crooked nail!? Went back to get it fixed but they only made it worse this was my first time coming here and it was a very bad experience for me.,0
"What a shame it's owners, Nexstar, has decided their stations are worth gold, and demanded all DirecTV customers PAY big time for watching their station. I hope the negotiations break down so that this CBS station never goes back on the air via satellite. That is a LOT of viewers they lost, so if you are a business considering placing an ad on this channel, be aware their number of viewers is WAY lower with the loss of all DirecTV customers for as of July 31, 2019, nearly an entire month. An ad should cost you a lot less money on Ch 8. Sad for their news team who are getting little exposure for their careers.",0
"If you like burgers and fries, you'll like this place. Ordered an appetizer of mussels, over done.  Swordfish entre...way over done and stringy.  The unmashed potatoes are not seasoned, completely bland...as is the rice that came work my husband's also very over done swordfish.   To top it off they were out of Penn Pilsner...in Pittsburgh!  Ok, that happens. .. but how disappointing!  Server did take my entree off the bill.  My husband ate his bc he was starving... We didn't mention that to the server.Our son said his burger was really good.",0

Last time I bring my car here. I have used them in the past and always had great service. Today I come in at 943 for a 930 appointment. Immediately the front desk tells me they have a 15 minute late window so I looking at my phone while speaking to her and it is 915. So I made the late window according to their policy. So now I have to speak with Derek. Derek comes out and immediately tells me that I am late and they may not be able to do it. I explain that I was on time according to their policy. He says no you're not. I said just forget it and was about to leave. He then says to let him finish talking and will now do his best to get it done but it may take longer because if the next appointment is on time he has to take the. Fair enough I understand and can wait. Then he continues arguing with me after I agree to have them do it. Amazing but I guess being right is more important than customer service. Too bad,0
I've been to many other Chatime locations and this is by far the worst one. The only one I actually have to cross off my list. At first I thought it was due to them being new but I've been back a few times after a couple months and nothing has improved.Most recent experience:-Ordered the Roasted Milk Tea with Red Bean. Barely any roasted flavour and just tasted watered down. -Cheap with toppings. Barely had any red bean for a large drink. I usually go to the one in Mississauga and that place always give a good portion of toppings.-I complained with one of the staff members and asked for additional red bean and was told that I was given two scoops already. Told them that they give way less than other locations but did not seem to care and just directed me to the manager.-Manager complied and gave me more red bean but put it in a cup (I suppose they did not want to completely remake the drink)Won't be coming back to this location. Even if you live in Brampton I think its worth it to just go to the Mississauga one.,0
I am a local who is also a native. I have worked for other properties and found that check in went well. However when attempting to go up the elevator to go to my room I was over ran by the housekeeping staff. Most properties have an employee elevator so the guest can access their rooms without being ran over by staff departing from work. They were zigzag in front of you and expect you as the guest to get of their way when you (the guest) are trying to locate your room. Then I call for my luggage on the hotel phone and the operator snaps (I can't hear you). If they are having issues with their phone system they need to address it with IT dept as well as kindly advise the guest that unfortunately they are having trouble understanding you. If the operators are unhappy when they leave home they might want to check that attitude at the door before they enter work.,0
The 1st time I use A&E auto glass they'd outstanding job.

They nickel and dime you for extra sauce and bread.  Unreal; my family and I will never go back.,0
I will preface this by saying we ordered from this restaurant through uber eats. This has been the worst restaurant I've ever ordered online from. I ordered a simple hamburger and the bun was soaking wet. The burger was overcooked and had mild peppers with stems left on it. My wife ordered a corn beef sandwich which also was disgusting. I never write reviews on restaurant but i need to send a warning to everyone else to NOT EAT AT THIS RESTURANT.,0
"Ok I don't understand all the other reviews..  I originally had plans to goto carvel up the street but the owner closes at 8 p.m. (oh well his loss).  So this was the next nearest place and I love frozen yogurt and this was my first visit here too. So I arrive at about 8:15 p.m. on a Friday nightI walked in, the place is very nice, spacious, clean, I loved how you could select and mix all the different flavors and stuff and the price was fine too. They had 5 people already sitting outside eating and another 10 inside in line. So I'm thinkin this place is gonna be good.  I tried 3 flavors there (peanut butter, cake batter, and cookies and cream). As I was walking back to the car, I tried the cake batter first. Their yogurt was very creamy and smooth, but something was missing. I tried the next flavor and then my 3rd flavor ALL 3 were COMPLETELY FLAVORLESS. I was very disappointed. I figured ok 1 type might be lacking flavor but all 3???  Sorry I will never go back.",0
"I telephoned in an order at 6:42 PM last night, they said it would be ready in 15 minutes, so I arrived in 12.  I called them inside to let them know I was here per the instructions on the sign at take away pickup.  I waited and waited, and called back 15 minutes later and a young inexperienced person told me that she could see them packaging up to go orders so she was sure he was on his way out.  Again I waited, 15 minutes after that I called back and asked to speak to a manager, she laid the phone down and no one came back to speak with me, 5 minutes later I hung up. At 7:42 with no call back and no one bringing my to go order out, I left, they never did call to tell me my order was ready or to ask me where I was......  This used to be a nice location, I won't be back.",0
If there's is a negative star I will definitely pick that one. The waiter ( the boss) talks so loud and has been so rude to some customers. Food portion is small but pricey. Won't come again and not recommend this restaurant..,0
"I would like to start by complimenting Wesley on his massage talents. I had a lovely hour-long massage and he really worked on the knots in my shoulders and neck. Wesley was the only redeeming quality about my visit.That being said, this ""spa"" is terrible. Terrible location in a run-down strip mall. My boyfriend and I found this place via groupon. I purchased a massage for him and a package including a massage, gel mani, and pedi for myself. While I was happy with the massage I received, the woman who did my bf's massage was AWFUL! After the massage he said he wondered if she was ever trained. She also ended his massage a full 15 minutes before mine. The 55 min massage we paid for ended up being a forty min rub. My pedicure was also very disappointing. No scrub, no foot massage (my favorite part!), and she cut one of my cuticles way too aggressively, making it very sore for days and made me worried about getting an infection. The polish seems to have lasted well enough, but I chose an OPI color. Probably the only professional aspectof the pedi. The gel manicure was worst of all. I have had gel manicures in the past and this was by far the worst and sloppiest I have ever seen.  I wanted white tips. What I got was half my nail painted white with the sloppiest line I have ever seen and gel all over the sides of my fingers and cuticles. I should have known better considering the state of her own nails. Atrocious!  Bottom line: STAY AWAY",0
Very dissatisfied with their customer service! After having dinner here Monday night with my family I got home and checked my bank and noticed that Applebees charged me twice for our dinner so when I called to talk to Michelle the acting manager she tried to blame my bank! After speaking with my bank on Tuesday morning my bank told me that it was that merchant which is Applebees who charged my card twice so after calling back to Applebees I got a hold of Tommy who was the acting manager he was extremely aggressive on the phone with me extremely rude tried to tell me that it was the banks fault for overcharging me and it was not his servers fault he did not care about refunding my money! After speaking with Haley from corporate I hope this situation is resolved and I receive my $50 back! We frequent this location approximately three times a month and we will never be going back for customer service you just lost customers!,0
"Totally disappointing.  Go to Mon Ami Gabi on the other side of the casino floor if you want french bistro type of food.  The savory crepe I had here was dry and tasteless, while the one at Mon Ami Gabi was excellent.  Service was a bummer too.  Our waiter was inattentive and grumpy.",0
"Found this place last night on bringfido.com, I was in the area and had my dog with me so needed a place that was pet friendly. The ONLY good thing about this place was the large pet friendly patio area.We sat for a long time before even being acknowledged. In the dozen times a server walked by, not a single ""be right with you""No drink refillsAfter asking for a box, she began to place other customers dirty plates on top of my boyfriends plate making a comment like ""if you say you didn't like it I can take it off your bill."" I had to stop her from laying dirty dishes on our food and explained that we would be taking the food home if she brought a box. I could go on and on but will sum it up like this: Terrible service, possibly worst ever.The food was so-so.Won't be back.",0
"I would give this 0 stars if possible. I went in on Saturday to bowl with friends and had an AMF coupon for buy one session get one free. I presented the coupon when getting my shoes and was told I needed to hang on to it and bring it back after bowling. After bowling when going to pay, I was told that my coupon wouldn't work because it was after 8pm. When I pointed out the fact that nowhere on the coupon did it say that it was only valid during specific hours, I was told ""oh well I don't know what to tell you."" I cannot stand when companies won't honor their own coupons or deals. If you didn't want to honor it, don't give it out. Safe to say I'll never bowl at AMF again. M",0
"I have given Danny's Family car wash several tries to get it right; but they just can't do it.  If you want to just get a quick car wash, and you're not picky, then consider them.  However, if you want your car detailed skip Danny's.  They don't pay attention to the ""details"" (pun intended) and you are left with streaks on the windows, bugs still glued to your grill and lights, and grime still in the nooks and crannies.  All of these are acceptable for a basic car wash, but not for their VIP or for when you spend the money to have your vehicle detailed.Danny's is all talk, they do a heck of a sales job and then don't deliver.  They are consistent in their failure.Don't waste your time or money there.",0
"Stopped by for a quick bite. It has been a while since we have visited. Food was good and fresh, though it seems the lox portion on my lox and bagel has shrunk. What really struck me was the current condition of the cleanliness of the restaurant. The condiment station is missing a under counter door, the napkin dispensers are in need of a cleaning as well as all the condiment and beverage dispensers. Coffee had a boat load of grounds and employee told me ""oh it is probably just the first cup"" . Coffee brewer has all the filters and other items stacked on top- looks very ghetto. Two of the other coffee selections were so weak that you could see the bottom of the cup with a full cup. Something obviously went wrong, but it seems as if everyone see it but is blind to it as this is business as usual.Overall not the level of cleanliness and standards that Einstein's strives for. Disappointing experience.",0
"Worst dunking donuts ever. 6:45 AM busy in the drive through but not inside. Only one in line and I am not even being acknowledged by the girl pulling donuts. Shift manager is on the phone, no,acknowledgement. Kid making sandwiches overwhelmed. 5 minutes later, I ask him to get some help for the counter. I'm irritated. Same girl who was ignoring me comes around and just stands there. I offer a good morning and she shrugs. I tell her good manners prompt you to say good morning back. Nothing. I am buying donuts for my team, so I'm not leaving empty handed but I don't know where there is a closer dunkin donuts. This place is useless. Do not go here. Circle K coffee and donuts are better.   $15 an hour is not what these people deserve.",0
"I like the hours that that they are open. Courtney Behr was the best, however she is no longer there. Since her leaving I have seen probably 5 different doctors hoping to find one like her, to no avail. I ask Dr. Martinez a question and she immediately sends me for blood testing. I have taken 3 this year already. RIDICULOUS! I caught on after this last time. They keep having you come back for one test at a time to get the insurance and co-pay money. My son went in for a simple sports physical and it turned out to be a fiasco. I have been doing these for years all of a sudden he has to come back for TB testing, then again for a UA! REALLY!!! More money for them.  I would never recommend this place to anyone ever again. I am now looking for a new primary doctor.",0
So just left... I had a good day until.. I got a 16 piece and ended up with 15.. asked for plates and ended up with none... and a piece of chicken that was Bitten!!!!!!!!! Wtf!!!!!,0
"This place is a complete joke.  The company has no idea how ABA should be implemented or even how to engage with children on the spectrum.  Children regress after being here and display behaviors that were once never existent.  This place is all about money.  If a child is sick and needs to go home, they're staying...why? Because MONEY.  It genuinely breaks my heart the support these children are receiving.  This place LOOKS nice. Technology this, technology that but they have NO idea what they are doing.  Parents who have never been to another company have NO idea how therapy is supposed to be run so they take the word of the company that their child is doing better. PLEASE do your research and do that's best for your child and their future.",0
"My son's request for his birthday was ""Old McDonald's""  so since my wife refuses I sucked it up and came here Saturday.  I am not a fan of McDonald's or a fan of what it represents, I have respect for Ray Krock but that is about it and I am not sure he would be proud of what he serves today either.  I hope the franchisee doesn't hate me for this review but since McDonald's targets kids with its toys (I know I used to love to go to this place too as a kid) then it gives me no choice but to speak the truth because I am a loyal Yelper that has kids.  My children of course ordered chicken nugget happy meals so they can get the stupid toy.  I made them get the apples and apple juice.  I had not been here in so many years that I noticed an Angus burger that was now on the menu and looked good in the picture.  Of course it was dry and bland, the fries here are always good but I have since learned that they are not exactly 100% potato so there you go.  I pretty much felt like crap when I left but I wanted to not keep my kids always wondering about this place with the desire to go inside.  Next time if he makes the request I will buy a slice of pizza from Barro's across the way and just eat that while my kids eat here.  Sorry McD's your food doesn't do it for me.",0
"Went to this store to buy semi precious stones to make a chakra bracelet. Lady at the counter was not helpful. Actually very rude. It was near closing time and I wanted to be quick but for some reason she wouldn't help me find what I needed. When it was close to closing she only approached me (even though their were others in the store) and said that I needed to hurry because she wants to close. I then said that unfortunately, I didn't get any help and therefore it's taking me longer than even I would like as well. Went to this store once when it first opened and I'm reminded today of why, I didn't step foot into this store.  Lost a big sale today $100.",0
"I went to Dumpling house and ordered chicken hot pot , spicy beef and two rice. It took maybe 15 minutes to hot pot serve on table then beef and rices. The chicken hot pot I not see much chicken meat in it ..little meat on bone. I think lot mushroom ...is not easy to eat ..is almost choke from that. The spicy beef is moist and I can feel spicy on it. For all of that almost cost $30. I think is bit much cuz the hot pot chicken I mean hot pot chicken bone that cost almost $10 , rice for 2 cost almost $4 I think to expansive for price for rice and spicy beef around $11 . I'm sure I will not ordered chicken hot pot anymore $10 for chicken bone and some mushroom which nearly choke me.",0
I recommend against this company. They tried to rip us off by installing a deceptively similar but much smaller deck than we had agreed to. If I hadn't measured it and complained they would have gotten away with much less material cost. Then they tried to place a Lien on our home. Again it required vigorous complaining to get this addressed. They use overworked underpaid workers who ignored basic safety procedures.,0
"Very bad experience. We were seated immediately, however we didn't get menus until 15 minutes later when the server came to ask us if we want drinks and we had to ask for a menu. The food was horrible!! The arugula and pear salad was way too salty. I ordered the veal chop special and asked for medium well. The outside was burnt and the meat was so dry and tough that it was inedible. My stomach started hurting after one bite and I could not eat the rest. It was definitely a waste of money and I will not be returning. If you want steak go to the keg or Ruth's Chris where they do it right. If you want Italian food, go to an actual Italian restaurant.",0
"Can I give them a negative 10 stars?I brought my 2005 Toyota Corolla to them on May 29/2017 to have the passenger side airbag replaced under recall.I decided to have them change my brake fluid and manual transmission fluid as well, they also replaced my drive belt as they said it was badly worn.Picked up my car at approximately  4 PM and drove down MacLeod Trail to 162AVe and up the ramp to eastbound Sunvalley Blvd  to find I had no brakes. Fortunately it's a manual transmission so I always gear down..this time I had to use the park brake to come to a stop. Promptly turned around and went back to the dealer . Turns out  they left the bleed nipple on the left rear side open. Fluid drained all the way down the road. High school mechanics wouldn't have screwed that one up. I have pictures of brake fluid all over Canyon Creek lot and in their service bay,They  cleaned up the fluid under the car then David Wilkins offered me 150 dollar credit for future service..like I would ever go back. I had them take the brake fluid service off my bill . I have to wonder how they managed to squirt brake fluid on the windshield after they did the so called ""clean up"" I'll never know.  Plus brake fluid all over under the hood and gear oil dripping off the bottom of the engine.  Hint..if someone brings you a 13 year old car and it's spotless under the hood...return it to the customer that way",0
Waited for over 10 minutes for my order. They just brought it out and it's wrong. I'm writing the review while waiting. This is nuts. Oh and they were RUDE!,0
"Have been coming to this cafe on and off for a few years.  However, today was a horrible experience.  I placed an order at the sandwich counter with for a turkey breast sandwich and then paid for the meal. About 15 minutes later they call out that a chicken salad sandwich is ready and then I told the cashier and the same girl that took my order that I ordered a turkey sandwich.  15 minutes later I still don't have my sandwich.  30 minutes or more have past and in fact she did not even start making my turkey sandwich and when I asked for my sandwich she asks me ""you wanted a turkey sandwich?"".  Anyway, I asked for a refund and got one and spoke to the owner.  No apology from the girl making the sandwich from the counter but at least the owner seemed concerned.  Food is fine but in this instance VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.",0
"Really unimpressed.  This is essentially a more expensive version of Subway with food that doesn't taste as good.  Slow service makes the lines long and move slow.  Definitely won't be back.  I did like that they fresh cut a lot of the meat, but not enough to ever go back.",0

"Never, Never, Never step foot in here!!!In my 66 years in this world I have never experienced a co owner that cried I hate you, this business, and humanity as a whole.  It's taken a month for me to settle down and write this review, but now I can review this place rationally without emotion.We did not have a reservation, but decided after a night at the movies we would just walk in and take our chances. We waited 40 minutes, but that was ok. When we were seated, we waited 15 minutes before the owner came around, running by our table, only to brake stop and say are you ready to order. Since waiting fur the fifteen minutes, I asked for some water and he tersely said, you would have to wait another ten minutes for him to come back for our order if we got water. We said we were ready to order after that statement! I then asked if I could get a half order of the meat platter and he rolled his eyes in disgust. I then went with the kakabobs. Two small skeweres later with a half a cup of tossed salad cost me $ 14.00 and were marginal at best. We asked if they served bread we were brought some prior to our meal.  The check came and I noticed we were charged$3.00 for 4 slices of bread. I brought it to co owners attention and he said they have been charging for the bread since they opened years ago. Then it happened, he says, You are not happy here, all of you, Never come back again. You are not welcome here.  My friend, could not believe what he was hearing and went over to the other owner and explained what happened and how rude this guy was to us.  Even as we walked out the rude owner pointed me out and said that he had an issue with me and I was not welcome and there are plenty of other restaurants I can go toHe's got that right!!!!! He took lessons from the Seinfeld, Soup Nazi personality wise...except the food is simply not worth the bother!!!",0
"The Asian man who works this store is extremely racist. This post will only beneficial to African American clients even tho my girlfriend is not. All other races will not notice at all as usual so please scroll down to the next review.My experience with this store was shocking. I entered the store and was greeted by the women working here. They were pleasant and also women of color.  It may be important to note that I am a black male and was only accompanying my girlfriend who now does not want to go back to this establishment altho she did make a purchase.Upon entering I found a seat on the immediate right side of the store. I was not interested in walking around. This man literally yelled at me saying get up you can't sit over there. His direspect was obvious however I just got up and moved to a location where I could stand and not be in the way of the women shopping. For some reason I wasn't phased as it was clear he was an ignorant foreigner who only knows cable television.You won't believe this, if your black you will. This man then left behind the counter to come stand and stare at me while I'm just standing by a counter. I was so thrown by this direspect I stared directly at him. After five seconds of eye contact he crossed his arms, after five more seconds he stepped back ( I'm still staring directly in his eyes) then after another five seconds he walked behind the register. What an asshole. I feel sorry for the young women who have to work with this pompous assholeMy baby found a wig but says she does not want to go there anymore. She loves me :)",0
I bought a 90min couples combo through groupon for my fiance and I. We had arrived early to check in and session was started at scheduled appointment time. everything was going smooth until they ended session 20 minutes early.

"Course is a wonderful layout. Overall conditions were the worst I have ever seen. It honestly felt like the course has been closed all season and it just reopened today...Tee boxes, tired in most respects. Fairways...horrible. Weeds everywhere and honestly it's probably been 3 weeks since they were last cut. Besides the grass type difference there was basically no difference to the rough. In all areas of the primary rough it was 5+ inches high and probably hasn't been mowed all season. Greens were punched 11 days ago and they were horrible. Bumpy as all can be, haven't been mowed in probably 2 days and if you didn't play a max 2 putt you'd probably quit after the first hole. Greens were slower than most fairways are on a normal 4 star course. Sand traps, nothing manicured and needs tons of work on every hole. I paid $40 for a ""aeration rate"" but I wouldn't go back for $5. There needs to be someone on every lawnmower, trimmer and roller they have for the next two weeks straight just to get the grass on the course back in decent playing conditions. Totally disappointed and wouldn't recommend this to anyone to play right now.",0
Read the great reviews and was greatly disappointed. Bread was stake food tasted odd and Chios were burnt.,0
"Frequent customer to Little Chicago, and they'd almost always get a 5 Star rating. This evening we ordered out a pizza and it had a hair on it. We called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, and they handled it really well. We get it, this is unfortunate. Shouldn't happen, 99 times out of 100 it doesn't. But it did. So the manager put in a new order for us and said they'd have it delivered. It's been almost two hours and we still don't have our replacement pizza. We live 5 mins away. And when we called to inquire about the order about a half hour ago, we were told it'd be here any second and that they got really busy. At a bit of loss at this point.Update: Finally arrived at 2 hours on the dot. Pizza is cold and looks like it's been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour. Not eating this. $20 down and two useless pizzas. We'll be finding a new pizza place.",0
"Sitting at the bar. Been here for 30 mins. Served drinks fairly quickly. Bartenders can't keep up. A guy came to help the lone girl bartender. Still haven't taken our dinner order, drinks are empty. Trying to get someone's attention to check out. Finally got his attention. Going elsewhere for dinner and won't be back.",0
"I work in The Quarter and have been in to this location 3 times in 2 months to buy something specific. Sales people have never treated me or asked what I was looking for. Today, one of them walked past me to greet someone else. I actually prefer the quality at Restoration Hardware, but some of my collections are PB!!!! Anyway, I'll never go back. PS. I just left Crate and Barrel, that's where I'll be shopping from now on!",0
"I think I feel sick after trying to eat this food.  Ewww. Out of desperation we called and ordered food for delivery from this place.  I got the cashew chicken, which I don't even think was  chicken. Some odd substance. Egg drop soup was gross as well.  Ordered side of fried rice which cost extra and I don't think I EVER saw fried rice look that.  Thanks for the most nastiest Dinner ever. I'll go throw up now. ..",0
"Our new solar system was activated in May, 2017. The first few electric bills had a large Surge charge. I notified Sundrop and they said the load limiter was not working. They replaced that and it seemed to be working. However the load limiter makes using our heavy appliances very difficult as it shuts them off during peak hours.Our system quit working on June 1, 2018, but we did not know about that until August 1 when SRP notified us. I called Sundrop and nobody answered the phone. I left a message but nobody called back. I did this many times and never got a call back. I finally called the owner, Mike Bulatovich. He called back and said he would send a repair the next day. But that never happened. Subsequent calls to Mike were never returned.I went to the office at 415 S 48th St, Tempe, and found it was empty. The company name had been removed from the door.Do not use this company!!",0
"Decided to go to Macaroni Grill to celebrate my husband's birthday - what a mistake. Thought it odd on a Saturday night at 6:30 that there were no people waiting. We were seated immediately. Half the restaurant had empty tables. Waiter was pleasant, took our drink and appetizer order. When the appetizers came out (Tomato Bruschetta and Mac and Cheese poppers), the bruschetta bread was burnt. I questioned the waiter and he told me that's the way it's supposed to come out. The bread was actually charred. The manager came over and told us the same thing. The sauce that came with the mac and cheese poppers was so oily that the oil was floating on the top. Three people in the party ordered pizza and I ordered chicken parmigiana. When the meal arrived, only the 3 pizzas came out. No explanation as to where the chicken parmigiana was. One of the pizzas was totally black on the bottom and edges. It was inedible. No waiter ever came over - I had to ask the hostess to bring the manager over. When he arrived, I asked him if this was the way the pizza was supposed to be - charred on the bottom. He then said absolutely not and he had no explanation as to where my dinner was. Needless to say we got up and left, never to return.",0
"This place could be a great little saloon if you could get rid of all the drunk college kids and wanna-be cowboys, and then find a decent band that isn't constantly begging for tips.On the up-side, its a great place to hang out if you're a drunk college kid or some wannabe-cowboy who likes listening to some half-assed band beg for tips all night long.",0
"Dirty, bad service, expensive and bad food.When we told the waiter that the donut in the milkshake was stale, he responded that ""they buy them and sometimes they are not good!"".I guess the cafe theme, extend to the food they serve. Not worth the time!",0
I can't imagine a worse steak in Toronto ... I was only here because there was a 45 minute wait for a table at The Keg up the road. I will be more patient next time.Pass on this joint it's painfully generic.,0
"This will be a long post but PLEASE READ before buying a car here! On June 24th 2018 I bought a 2007 Jeep Wrangler from this dealership and it was the WORST decision of my life. That day I test drove the Jeep and everything worked fine and felt fine, I totally fell in love with it so yes I followed through with buying the Jeep. Went home super excited but then the next day came and I started seeing problems in the Jeep. The AC started blowing really hot air, the breaks were squeaking so loud but let me remind you it didn't do any of this on the test drive. So I brought the Jeep back in and told them about the problems. They guys working there looked a me as a woman that didn't know anything about cars and the used car manager came out and try to tell me that it's just a Jeep thing, that all jeeps have horrible AC and it doesn't run cold!!! Let's just say BULLSHIT. I told him that's not the case. I know people that have jeeps and their AC runs fine so he needs to take it to the back and test it and fix it. After a little bit of going back-and-forth he finally had someone take the Jeep back and they said they recharge the AC but there is nothing they can do about the brakes. After all that I'm driving back home and in 10 minutes into the drive the AC was hot again. I brought it back a few days later and said they ac still isn't fixed and they said sorry nothing we can do for you....At this point I'm super annoyed and I just went home. Then a family friend come over to look at my jeep because stuff was wrong with it, come to find out this AutoNation Nissan sold me a vehicle with two broken shocks and a few broken springs. When I heard this I was infuriated. You go to a dealership to find a new car and put your trust in them to sell you a great vehicle but that's not what I got. They sold me a broken one! That next day I brought the Jeep back in and asked to speak to the used car manager again and I told him about the parts that was broken on it and this was his response. "" yeah we knew those parts are broken there's nothing I can do for you."" What the hell you sold me a car KNOWING ALL THESE THINGS WERE BROKEN!? I kept telling him he needed to fix it and it's not OK for him to sell me a broken vehicle, and all this guy could say was ""there's nothing we can do"", literally I think those were the only words he knew how to say ""there's nothing we can do."" I was so frustrated that I'm crying because now I'm stuck with a vehicle that's broken and the people that sold it to me are saying that they won't do anything to help me. Finally the use car manager said well let me go talk to my manager and see if there's anything we can do. While he was gone I had multiple people that were in the waiting room with me come up to me apologizing saying I needed to make sure they fix this, that it's not OK which they are totally right! Nothing about this situation is OK! So finally after an hour of arguing with this guy ( which I have this all on video Incase he tried to say none of this happened to save his ass) he finally said they will buy me brand new shocks for the jeep. But then I would have to pay the labor to put them on which is stupid. So the shocks finally came in and I decided just to take the shocks to have someone else do it because I obviously have no trust in this place to do anything correctly. Still after driving the jeep around for about a month there's were more problems coming up and it just wasn't something I was happy with anymore. So I went to another dealership and traded that jeep in. Now here's the crazy thing I went to the dealership I got my new vehicle from to get them some paperwork yesterday and I asked him oh did someone already buy the jeep because I didn't see it on the lot. This is exactly what the sales guy told me"" honey that jeep had so many issues that we physically could not sell it on our lot, it's against all of our rules and it won't pass any test to be able to be sold on our lot, so we just have to give it to an auction so they could auction it off."" I was in shock how could AutoNation Nissan sell me a vehicle that Earnhardt could not possibly even think about selling to a customer. That just shows how unprofessional AutoNation is! They do not have your best interest at all in selling your vehicle. So please re-consider when thinking about buying a vehicle from this place!!!!",0
"The shipping service is alright but the customer service is ridiculous. Not only did they forget to ship my package from Mississauga to my home, the CSR handling my case, Mickey, started swearing at me over the phone when I asked for a courtesy shipping fee waive since it was their mistake that they hadn't shipped my product out. I was called a ""f--ing retard"" and she threatened to not have my product shipped out at all. Her exact words ""you know I could delay your package right?"" Got the same kind of nonsense from the ""manager"" Chris. It's incredulous that someone would speak to anyone that way, let alone a paying customer. I used to love this company, but if it means I get treated like crap, I don't know if they deserve anyone's business. Furthermore, when i did receive the package, it was soaking wet because it had rained and the company didn't even bother shipping it properly as others do when whether conditions can cause damages.",0
This place is WAY overpriced and the food reminds me of eating in a cafeteria.  The only bright spot to my meal was the coleslaw.  The decor is very eclectic to put it nicely but nothing that makes it stand out.  Service was ok but the server ignored me at first until I had to flag her down to ask to order a drink.  Not somewhere if ever eat again.,0
"Bad customer service from manger Michelle. Was not helpful. Waited ten mins for her to answer phone and I asked why I waited so long, her response was her device that she didn't need wasn't turning on.",0

I been going there since year but every time I went this restaurant is shut down with health department I was curious why is closed then I read the health department sign at the door they had so many critical violations repeated that's why it been closed. Buffet is cheap but poor hygiene I I'll not recommended to go there if you want healthy food,0
Went to Stoney's while in Vegas.... My girlfriends and I stepped out on the dance floor to dance and we were kicked off the floor by one of the bouncers because we weren't doing the line dance that others were doing!  The cover was $10.00 for women on a Friday night and they charge $3.00 for a bottle of water!  Never coming back and the bad reviews will keep rolling in!,0
This was our first visit. The two of us showed up at 7:03pm. The front door was open and the menu board was outside on the sidewalk. We walked to the counter to place our order and a gentleman came out from the back and told us they were closed (at 7:00 apparently). Really? We were 3 minutes past 7:00 and we couldn't get a couple of burgers?  They should have closed the front door. Won't be back. Sorry.,0
"I like the selection of groceries and flowers that they have. The redbox and bank are also convenient.  The reason they are getting a low rating is because of their customer service to people that use government assistance such as wic. I am not someone that ever abused the system. I legitimately needed the assistance I was getting. I never had any trouble using wic anywhere else,  but here. They only had 1 checkstand that could accept the card (ever other store allows you to use it at any checkstand) and it was never open! I would have to ask someone amd wait forever for someone to come and check me out at the station. The cashier treated me like I was scum each time. They were rude and loud. They gave me crap about the brand of milk I got and argued with me that wic won't let it through ( they do). Not only were they rude to me they were so loud that everyone around can hear them demeaning me and talking about my using wic. I asked for the manager and she wouldn't even come out to talk to me. She just said no over the phone. I've never been made to feel that way in my life. I'm now off of wic and will not shop at Vons.",0
"So I take my street glide in for warranty repair, I called them and setup an appointment with Bernie in service. The soonest they could get me in was 3 days. I expected to be away from my bike for a few days. Anyways. So I show up for my appointment before they were open as soon as the doors opened I was one of the first to get in line, so I explain my concerns with Bernie. And he is writing my concerns down and giving me prices. As I'm telling him what I think needs to be done he's telling what they recommend. He's telling me that my bike is at 10,000 miles and needs spark plugs and all kinds of other services. So know I'm getting more upset with him because according to the manufacturer the spark plugs are not due until 30,000 miles. So at this point I feel like he's trying to rip me off. I told him I need an oil change and primary fluid change, that's what is on my service schedule and kept explaining my shifter issues which is the reason #1 reason I'm there for a warranty claim. I told him what I wanted and even verbally explained to him DO NOT SPEND MY MONEY WITHOUT FIRST GETING MY VERBAL CONSENT. And he said not a problem, now let's keep in mind I'm still very frustrated that my motorcycle with 10,000 miles has this shifter broken. I'm a very passionate person when it comes to my Vehicle. So yes I'm not happy to be there in the first place. I even explained this to Bernie. I even told him I'm sorry if my attitude is coming off very dry and direct I payed a lot of money for this motorcycle and expect the American icon of motorcycles to be durable. So once again I told him as I'm signing the check in sheet. DO NOT SPEND MY MONEY WITHOUT FIRST GETTING MY CONSENT. And I leaveLater in the afternoon a friend of mine calls me because he's seen a Facebook status that my bike in for service. He called me upset because he owns a motorcycle repair shop and I should be there getting it services and I explained to him my #1 reason for taking it to them. He said we'll make sure that when they remove my primary to repair my shifter assembly the extended warranty will pay for the primary fluid. So I'm like cool let me call Bernie. So I did and he said yes they would pick up the cost of the fluid as well. Now at this point I'm happy because I also asked Bernie while on the phone with him what is the estimated timeline for completion. He responds is it will be done before 6pm today. I'm like right on. So later in the day comes around still no word from Bernie about approval of any work so I'm guessing it's under the warranty. So it's getting near 4:30pm and finally get a call from him and its him saying my bike is done and ready for pick up. I asked what time they close because I'm not off work till 6pm. And he responds with they close at 6pm and they will be open the next day. I told him I Will see him soon. I got there at 5pm to pick up my bike. He's busy with another customer and I'm standing near him and the customer is talking to him by his desk. He couldn't even take a sec and say hey I will be right with you. Instead he gives me a kind of dirty look and walks the other customer to his bike. I'm like okay I still need to get back to work so I can shut down and lock my shop. Finally another service writer sees me and kindly asks is there anything I can help you with I said sure can you cash me out I'm here to pick up my motorcycle. And he said sure no problem we walk to his desk and he asks my name and pulls me up on the computer and gives me my total balance due and I'm floored because it's $200.00 over what I authorized. So I ask him to show me the repair order. Bernie charged me for repairs I didn't consent to. So as I'm reading this Bernie comes over and I'm mad. And he explained why the bill is this much I told him I didn't authorize this amount of work. And he said well you signed for it on check in. I said I signed a check in sheet for a visual inspection and a oil change. Now I want my bike and he tells me I can't have it till the bill is payed. Now keep in mind I still need to get back to work, I'm mad about the bill, I'm mad about the bike I'm even more upset because I was over charged. I payed the bill and left. I get to work and the #1 reason for me taking it in is not fixed. Now I'm hot. So I called my credit card company and disputed the charges. The next day I call to speak to the service manager Matt and I explain my concern and his response is oh well you signed for it. I kindly asked him for a partial refund for the amount of work that I didn't approve of. He told me no. So I ask him who's his boss. And he tells me the GM his name is Mike so I ask to speak to him. I get a voicemail. I leave a message and he later returns my call and I explain everything and he says the same thing well you signed for it and I'm not giving you a refund. I told him I disputed the charges and I will call him back on Monday. At this point I will update my review later once I talk to him.",0
Very dishonest people. Will rip you off and make your car worse. They are a bunch of liars!!! This company is a fraud!!,0
The service was bad. The waiter got us our drinks once. We got our food 30 minutes later and then we got a refill on our drinks. Not coming to this one again.,0
"Bad service, manager on duty was rude,orders came incomplete and shortage on all toppings!!!",0
"HORRIBLE. Car was marginally clean at best. No spotless rinse. Hard water deposits left on side mirrors, back window, etc. I'd say you get what you pay for but at $10 for an exterior only wash, what a ripoff. Save your money and go elsewhere.",0
My child in this clinic has been switched from clinicians at least 5 times within the course of 5 months. How do they expect for my child to excel in therapy when he is switched so many times. It takes a child time to adjust to a new clinician and once they get used to them they get switched again. At this clinic they also have speech assistants treat stuttering which they are not qualified to treat. They do not do whats best for the client they do whats best for themselves. When I was given feedback about my child the therapist only took 2 minutes and quickly moved on to there next kid. I feel like a number here and have decided to go some where else. I highly do not recommend this place. There are better places to take your child where it will not feel like they are a number. Don't let yourself fall by all the toys they have in the clinic. Looks can be deceiving.,0
"its' been a while since they worked on my vehicle but I never reviewed it.  After they worked on my car to the tune of over $1000...it leaked radiator fluid all over my garage and oil still leaking.  they broke things in my car and though they fixed some of it, I find that unacceptable.  Buyer beware.",0
"My husband and I came here for a Nutella treat. We were served right away by someone who apparently only knew how to make coffee. We ordered the Nutella crepe with fruits and an espresso. This person had to call someone else to come make the crepe. We waited about 10 minutes for him to arrive. In that time the original server said that we could be seated and our food would be served to us there. Low and behold after 15 minutes, the server who made the crepe is yelling around to see who had a crepe. After we finally got his attention he rudely told us that we need to wait at the bar for our food next time. The joke was on him because my husband and I knew there would be no next time. All the tables here were dirty, the staff were young and pretentious and do not live up to the pusateris brand. Not coming here again! Overpriced and overrated!",0
Great coffee. Cafe looks terrible.  It doesn't send the image of a coffeehouse. Sterile and cold like a hospital.,0
"I'm totally bewildered. I ordered a single burger with catsup only and a small Coke with extra ice. Seemed pretty simple to me. The screen showed a cheeseburger, so I asked the girl to fix it, she said she'd take care of it. I got to the window and the young man said $5.89. I told him he couldn't have the order right. He said a Dave's Cheeseburger and a Coke with no ice. I said no, a single burger with catsup only a small Coke with extra ice. He said well the Coke is $1.69. You wanted that with no ice right? Oh, no, just a separate cup of ice. I put my head in my hands for a moment, then repeated for the fourth time what I ordered. He again repeated back two different things. I said just give me my money back, you people are too confused. I had to snatch my $5 bill out of his hand, and he hollered as I drove away, sarcastically, I apologize ma'am! Goodness gracious, how can two employees be so unable to complete a simple order?",0
Consistently the worst McDonald I've ever been to. It's hard to imagine how this store is so bad compare to others.,0
"Absolutely the worst experience I have ever dealt with. As I sit at this moment filling out closing paperwork, I asked for a check list of everything I needed at the beginning. Never received such list. And they misplace paper work to distract and confuse you. And I'm getting back no where near the amount I was supposed to after my deposit and sellers assist I lost out in another 1000+ dollars.They also made my fiancé cancel a dispute with the credit agencies, which would have cleared by the end of the closing time costing us another $400.When further investigated the account we paid was paid in 2009. Lois is a pain to deal with and Ernie just didn't have the numbers right. All and all I was rushed to hang drywall to hurry and close and that was a month ago.... So I got ripped off for that job as well another 320 down the toilet. I would highly recommend going to your bank and abound these people at all cost!",0
The people are friendly here but it ends there. They tell you one thing but do another. In the very beginning I ask for one therapist. I was told there would be only one therapist working with us . That was a lie. It's been a three ring circus. Your lucky if you see the same person twice. I would not recommend.,0
"Went with a large party for a private event. Ordered the blue cheese ribeye with a side of goat cheese gnocchi and calamari as an appetizer. Calamari was very good, the right amount of sweet, spicy crunch. The ribeye was below Applebee's quality at best. Really disappointing. Low quality cut of meat and seared with a blow torch on the top for cosmetics and to melt the cheese. Lastly, the goat cheese gnocchi was simply inedible. Very spongy, oily, and pungent which makes for bad all around. Will not return again as there is not much that I enjoyed other than the calamari.",0
"Ever since South Point opened, I have desperately wanted to like it. Truly. I just can't. It's the ""motel hotel"" of LV casinos, ranking slightly higher than Terrible's. From the car park to the layout of this ""locals"" joint, I don't care for it at all. There's always a funky stench. I've had food poisoning in the Cafe. The restaurants here aren't good & barely decent. And yeah, that goes for Steak & Shake, an over rated, get what you pay for, dump. There is nothing about South Point that would inspire me to return, or want to return. The decor alone is plain & unappealing. It's very boring. If you like understated, and find GVR, M Resort, or Strip corridor resorts over the top or extravayou might enjoy South Point. They definitely cater to a different group of guest.",0
"Waited all day, no courtesy call. After changing our window of when they would arrive. We told them we would be right back just went to the store and they left without as much as a phone call. Never again",0
"Love this place and the people. The cashiers are the soul of the place. The food is southern comfort. Family oriented and good price.  Update: the original cashiers are gone and the service is suffering. Poor customer service, hang up on customers to go orders, incorrect orders, etc. too bad I liked this place. Not going back after two calls to place orders just to get hung up on.",0
beware !!!!!!!! attention health department!!! every time i eat here there is alway a hair in my food !! I have ordered from here over 3 times and every times!! if that isnt gross enough the food here is nasty as *f**k please call the health department,0
If I was more loaded this would have been ok but being sober...umm no. It took a super long time and I ordered off the eat on the run menu. My sweet potato fries were chewy and cold and my corn dog was ridiculously hot. Will remember not to go there next time.,0
They're closed. Supposed to be 24/7. Bologna. They're sign days 24/7 they have never been closed before and it isn't a holiday. Bad workers.,0
Worst restaurant ever; if I could gave them zero star I would.  My mom and I went for dinner and for the next 20 mins; not a single person came to our table.  I even made it a point to go to one of the waiters to ask for someone to serve us and yer no one came.  Save your money and don't bother going.,0
"This was the worst doctor office visit I've encountered in my life. I was supposed to see Dr Robinson for my carpal tunnel who I made sure is contracted with my insurance but somehow this Raia guy was foisted on me. He spent literally 1 minute with me, didn't do a full hand exam, examine my previous nerve conduction studies or do anything but tell me what carpal tunnel is (which I was well aware of already). Once I mentioned my interest in physical therapy or acupuncture before surgery, a switch flipped and he lost it. He told me condescendingly while shaking his head at me that my hand will never ever get better and essentially that I'm stupid for not diving into surgery and giving him my full trust. He didn't answer any of my questions, just told me ""Good luck with that"" and ran out of the room. His bedside manner is so amazingly bad, I can't believe he still has patients! Maybe the only way he can get them is by taking them from his partners.  Billing me for a 30 second or 1 minute office visit would be fraud in my opinion, so I'm making sure that these crooks can't bill my insurance, even if I have to get my lawyer involved.",0
"I ordered Rehab to be delivered to my hotel during my stay in the Pheonix area through Grubhub. I wanted to go with Shake Shack as I was familiar with them (East-Coaster) and every time I have ordered with them the food has been fresh, hot, and amazing. Unfortunately, their Pheonix location didn't deliver to my area. On to Rehab. The reviews looked good and the pictures were appealing. Now, a caveat. I fully understand that when food is delivered and takes a few minutes to get there, everything will not be quite as fresh as when it is eaten in-house. That being said, I'm very disappointed in my order with Rehab. I ordered 2 BYOB with fries and a Chocolate Lava Shake. Upon ordering, I noticed that the verbal description of the burger did not include cheese,  but the picture showed cheese, in addition to the condiments listed in the comments. I assumed this was an oversight because cheese is not something you can typically add in the comments area because it adds cost, but the picture showed cheese. So I searched for an option to add cheese, but it was nonexistent. Curiously, there were options to choose several different kinds of buns and many options for sides. I ordered the burgers medium well with fries to go along with the meals. Upon receiving my food, I knew something was wrong as soon as I put my straw in the milkshake. It was obvious that this food had been sitting for a long time. More than half of the shake was melted. Additionally, the shake had zero taste. The chocolate sauce on the lid looked pretty though. After seeing that the burgers had no cheese, I was irritated but the picture/description/no-option-to-add-anything screw up can be blamed for that. I went to add ketchup to my burger to add a bit of flavor and saw that the meat was overcooked and charred. I broke a piece off, hoping it would still be edible, and saw that not only was it overcooked, but it was very dry (as expected). The brioche bun was ok. So, I hoped beyond hope that the fries were edible. Nope. They were barely room temperature, hard, and tasteless. I didn't even taste any salt on them.So here I am, 44 dollars later (Food/Delivery Fee/20% Tip), having choked down half of a dry burger and about 3 dry, hard, cold fries with the help of my tasteless melted ice shake. I have food delivered to my hotel often as I travel for work, and I don't mind paying a bit more for good food and good service. That amount of money would have been no problem had the food been decent, or even edible. This experience was below subpar. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement.",0
"I've stayed here many many times but this time around I've never felt as disrespected as I had today. I had a dealer talk to me in a rude disrespectful manner and I took my concern to the ""Pit Boss"" ( Kevin Beers ) and his boss Ken and also to Katherine Corona ( hotel operation manager ) which they all gave me the whole ""it has been addressed"" talk. The dealer Ian Nelson repeatedly disrespected my wife and I with his choice of word out of nowhere and we took our concern to the upper management WHICH they TRIED to sweep it under the rug. I've been here over 7 times since last year and I spent nearly $2000 within 8 hours. For my wife and I to get disrespected the way we did and on her birthday is unacceptable. They ""OFFERED"" FREE BREAKFAST BUFFET to my wife and I as if we cared for a free $50 breakfast. I spent 12 times that amount in less then 24 hours gambling. I feel like nobody cares at this resort. I fee like the customer service is completely gone here. I remember back in the days they would make sure their guest would have a pleasant stay. Not anymore. Now a days all they care about is making money, taking money and not care about their guests. I truly feel upset and disrespected especially when I was looking forward to this trip with my wife. MGM has officially fell of the Favorite hotel list for me. I've always picked this resort over any other but it's evident that they no longer value their guests. All in all SAVE your money and DIGNITY and go book rooms at a NON MGM RESORT or better yet avoid MGM Hotel itself. I don't think anybody will understand my frustration with this situation and it's obvious they truly don't care. These so called managers are just simply here to collect a paycheck and not care about their guests well being. THANK YOU MGM FOR RUINING MY ENTIRE TRIP & ALSO THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME REALIZE YOU GUYS ONLY CARE YOURSELVES  AND NOT YOUR GUESTS. Shame on you!!! We were better off booking rooms at Cosmopolitan or Caesar Palace.",0
"I have nothing but bad things to say about Teleflora. I ordered Mother's Day flowers from this website, and what was received was nothing at all like what was presented. It was actually embarrassing. When I saw the flowers I sent, in a nutshell, I could fit them in my purse, including the vase! The arrangement was ridiculously tiny. I have never seen flowers that small. Never again! I wanted to post this review to spare anyone else from having this experience.",0
Went in for dinner on Saturday night to celebrate birthday. Wait time was less than ten minutes. Once seated waiter greeted us. Looking at the menu I did asked for non fattening dish. Waiting yawning for forty minutes later got the dish with melted cheese on top. I asked what it was and was told it is loaded. Hmm I returned the dish and cancelled the order. Took another twenty minutes to get the bill. Waiter did not try to offer anything else. After that went to in and out for protein style burger. Much cheaper than $20 loaded dish and was much healthier too. Looks like the customer service is not that great. I probably would not back to this place. There are several other places offering dishes at better price point and try to impress you specially if you are celebrating birthday.,0
"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.Ground transportation was provided by Grayline Tours for a tour I booked to the Grand Canyon. My pick-up was prompt at 5:40am with a few additional hotel pick-ups. All the passengers were transferred to Grayline Tours' customer center where the check-in process, upgrades and groups were split based on individual tours (South Rim/West Rim). I opted to upgrade my tour to include the Pink Jeep Private Tour. The charter did not depart the customer center until approximately 6:45am. So much wasted time! The first stop was at the Hoover Dam. Another waste of time to stop there for pictures. The bus was boarded again and we were en route only to make yet another stop. This time it was for a bathroom/snack break at a McDonalds. In my opinion, another unnecessary stop! From this point we traveled non-stop the Grand Canyon. Sadly, upon arrival at the National Geographic Center, we wasted another 2-hours (1 hour lunch; 30 minutes in IMAX movie; 30 minutes to meet with the assigned tour guide and board the jeep). Once we were off it was great! We stopped at five view points, but NOT enough time to enjoy what we paid for. I'm absolutely certain everyone in the group felt equally disappointed. The silver lining was that our tour guide was a really nice person. He shared lots of background on the Grand Canyon and some very unique stories. In retrospect, I regret upgrading from the basic tour. Two hours passed and the group was transferred back to the National Geographic Center. Within 15 minutes of our arrival, we boarded the bus for our transfer back to Las Vegas. We stopped to fuel. Apparently, it's illegal to refuel the bus with passengers on board. Like a herd, we unboard the bus. All the passengers took this as an opportunity to purchase snacks, beverages to tie us over. It was only about a 20 minute wait in the COLD. After that it was straight to Las Vegas. I was elated to be the first drop-off. Next time, I'll drive myself and so should you! Only then will be able to experience the majestic Grand Canyon! Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.",0
"Out of all the station casinos, this is the worst. We have given it a few tries to redeem itself. I feel bad if people come to LV and they think this is an example of buffets. The food is gross. Each time we've been there, it looks like leftovers. The food is not freshly cooked. It's been sitting there too long. The salad bar has no selection. We're done giving it a try. We'll drive a tad farther to Sunset Station. I advise everyone to do the same",0
"I ordered a large teriyaki chicken to go.  When I got home, and started eating it, I realized the chicken was burnt and very tough.  The rice was normal, but they poured so much teriyaki sauce onto it, it was gross, like covering up the burnt, tough chicken.  I'm very disappointed and won't be back.",0
I had a rental from a off-airport location that broke down. I've been dealing with trying to get a new car for 6 hours. Finally get down to the airport and they are giving me a hassle saying that they can't do anything because we did not rent the car from the airport location. I explained to them all of their off-site locations are closed and do not have any vehicles and this is where Hertz told me I have to get a new car. Finally got things rolling and they are getting me a car after many hours of arguments. Don't understand what the problem is you guys need to get your systems tied together in case something like this happens. I highly doubt this is the first time this has happened to somebody,0
Ouch.  This place is looking a bit sad and lonely since my last time here in the summer.  The croissants now look like they were picked up at loblaws.,0
"Disappointing first visit to Fountains Family Care. After showing up early to our confirmed appointment, the front desk advised us that our appointment somehow never made it into their system.  The help at the front desk was very rude and made it seem like this was somehow our fault, even though we showed them the confirmed appointment text message they sent us. Instead of apologizing and correcting their mistake which I would expect from any reputable doctors office, they gave us no assistance and we were forced to take a later appointment. After waiting over an hour and a half for the next available appointment time, we then continued to wait as we were not called in on time.  After finally being called in we were met and treated by a PA, never once saw the doctor we made the appointment with. Won't be back here.",0
"$39 per person is absolutely not worthy.  The crab legs are very salty and small like regular sizes and serve COLD.   The soups are so plain, not good, sushi is the worst, just the salads are fresh. Not worth the waits either.  Don't waist your money and time here.  If you are Asian,  you can tell the Asian foods are HORRIBLE!  Period.  Don't try.",0
We used to go to this restaurant 1-2 times a week for the last year. Our recent trip to this restaurant was extremely disappointing and sadly we will never return. We ordered a chillI chicken and Indonesian fried rice which is our staple (and please note the portions are tiny). This time they gave only vegetables and no chicken in our chilli chicken!! After letting them know they responded with bad customer service so needless to say they have now lost 2 valuable customers.,0
Food was alright at best. Service is okay. They ran out of beer...2 choices Stella's of Coors Light. Very few choices of anything on the menu. Save your money go somewhere else.,0
My wife and I were starving after meeting with an agent in this complex. We walked and saw this place. We walked in and no one greeted us or acknowledged us for over 5 minutes. Everyone was walking by and worse yet a girl was standing on her phone drinking a tropical smoothie. Never will return and recommend others never do too.  An absolutely horrible experience.,0
24 cinemas and one inept gal selling tickets. Bathrooms are dirty. Seats are old. Theaters are empty. WiFi doesn't work. Is this place getting ready to close?,0
"The Big Cheese?  I'm sorry, but this place should really be called ""Fries and Gravy"". There were hardly any curds.  I'd give it 4 stars if the big cheese served big cheese, but they don't.  I heart poutine.  I hope they pick up the slack.  That is all.EDIT: You can order extra curds for $1.25.  You need to add curdsx 3 to make it reasonable.  Makes a small poutine about ~$11.  You decide.",0
"You guys are ok, but lack any morals whatsoever. I pulled up to the Dt today,  and said "" can you please pull to the front"" I said no, i want to wait here. I used to work for arbys and I know what your doing,  your trying to beat the clock and fake report to your manager as well as the district supervisor.  I hope they see this as u guys try to Cheat and pull cars forward. I won't ever do that so your wasting your time with me",0
"My nephew was attending here and his mom just found out they wake him up from his nap by tipping him out of his cot, there is black mold and one child had pin worms and they did not clean properly. Do not bring your child here it needs to be shut down!!",0
"Just called to ask some questions about the practice.... Michelle sounded very skeptical and  said ""what for""... hello? I want to know I can trust your practice before I take my daughter there??? What else would it be? So, no, not switching to this practice!",0
Do not order to go from this place at lunch time. I called at 12:15 pm and was quoted 15-20 minutes. I arrived at 12:45 and my food was still not ready. I then waited an additional 15 minutes and was handed my single order of chicken fried rice at 1 pm. When I asked to speak to the manager her explanation was that the people dining in take precedence over the to-go orders. Poor service and poor response to a valid customer complaint. Oh and not to mention the meal cost of $15 with tax. I expect more if I'm paying that much for a lunch meal. I was one of 3 people who were sitting waiting an excess amount to get my to go order. The other customers didn't appear too pleased about the wait either.,0
"Update.....Just noticed today that they took off and stole my grab handle from the interior for the car. I'm guessing the reason was so they can fix one of their cars that they were trying to sell. I am honestly upset not only because they stole a part from my car, but also they I have to continue to deal with them in order to fix this issue that they caused. Just want to be done with this place. Another update: I contacted the CEO after the discovery of theft from my vehicle. Mr. Chapman had a manager contact me and after several apologies, the replacement part is finally back in my car. However, I find it extremely humorous that the service director replies to my review saying, ""we are glad we resolved the issue"" when in fact I contacted him countless times without any reply or help. Don't put on a front pretending like you helped me....",0
"Bookings.com is not to be trusted. For a vacation to New York city, I used Bookings.com to book the Helmsley hotel in Manhatten. Unfortunately, the day before I was to arrive, Bookings.com notified me that even though I paid in advance, the Helmsley had cancelled my reservation. Bookings was kind enough to provide a list of hotels for me to rebook, The problem was that all of the choices were substantially more costly than my original reservation. When I called Bookings, I was assured that I could book any choice, and they would assure that the Helmsley would make up the difference. I rebooked and after my vacation, I called Booking to find out when I would be repaid. They said to wait, and would call back. After two years and many calls and letters later, I know that I have been had. Do not trust these people.",0
"Service is horrible me and my boyfriend ate at this restaurant last night to celebrate my birthday and we were beyond disappointed. Our service was horrible, it started off nice and went down hill. It all started with the server Carla she was nice and attentive at first but don't let that fool you. Worst service ever! When she took our order she took our order with no pen and paper just the top of her head which I thought was fine I have seen servers do this before however she kept trying to remember everything and asking our orders repeatedly and I kept having to repeat myself fine. For the next 45 minutes we waited for our food to come out we did not get checked on the whole 45 minutes waiting for our food but we did see our server coming from the back blowing smoke from her mouth as she just came from outside smoking. She must have forgot to put our order in another 10 mins go by and we finally got our food mind you I never got the salad that was supposed to come with my $100+ meal. At that point I was so hungry I just wanted to eat my food and forgot the salad. She never apologized for how long our food took nor did she acknowledge it. Also it took us forever to even get our drinks and when she brought the food she forgot the drinks so she said she would come back with those my boyfriend also asked for more butter she comes back with the butter but no drinks and then she says oh the drinks! I'll be right back we finally get our drinks. As we're eating our food we are not checked on after that! She stays out of site no where to be found. We never get refills on our drinks we never get asked how our food was and now we're sitting there looking at each other waiting for our check that never came. We must have been her last table because she was so concerned with everything in that restaurant but her guest and being a manager myself our guests come first that was definitely not the case last night. We finally decided to get up from our table to go to the front of the restaurant to try and pay our bill as we're walking out she comes up to us and says are you ready for your bill? I didn't realize you were done eating. I wanted to say because you never checked on us. Anyways my boyfriend gives her $105 for our bill and our bill was $103 and some change she said she would bring back our change and receipt but never did we finally got fed up and left. I'm so disappointed with the service we received here. We will never return to your restaurant due to the lack of care and lack of customer service.",0
"I've reached out more than a couple of times and have had zero luck. I really wanted to try this location because of the great reviews on the ACTUAL work she does, but it's impossible to get a proper response out of her. All I got was, ""I'm busy so I have to find a time to fill you in"". It's been a couple of weeks now and not a word. Terrible way to ""run"" a business. Respectfully just tell me NO next time.",0
"I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries, my burger was pink on the inside..not how I like to eat them.  Our waitress was initially very helpful and took it back to the kitchen to have them cook it longer for me.25 minutes later my date had finished his meal and my fries were gone.  Our waitress never returned to let me know what was going on, when she did I ended up asking her to just box my burger up for me to go thinking I would eat it for lunch the next day.  When I re-heated the supposedly re-cooked burger the following day it was still pink on the inside.  So I am not sure what the kitchen had been doing for 25 minutes but it was not cooking my burger.We will not be returning here!",0
"I wish I could have been impressed. My family always drove by in the car, but maybe the place was packed that day. We wanted crab, the crab and corn was not what we expected from a restaurant The service was bad. We waited the longest time for our food and check We will never return unless invited to a party at the Crab Shack",0
"I Ordered Flowers by phone,  Lady seemed pleasant and helpful BUT my flowers never got delivered so I called for a refund and they ""couldnt"" issue me a refund so they gave me a credit.. I was using my Groupon so I told her that my Groupon expired in a couple weeks and she said it will be fine because I already paid, I asked her SPECIFICALLY "" So there wont be any problema?"" and she said No. Well surprise surpirse.. I called back today to bank on my Credit and they do not have anything on file for me.. so basically I lose out on $89  Flowers , cant get a refund for Groupon because the Voucher was already viewed.. this place is totally unreliable and not helpful at all.. they have no Customer Service Skills.",0
The food here is getting worse and worse the  Corn tortillas that they use for tacos are hard and rancid .their pico the Gallo should be called pico de onions bc that's all you could find in it.tamarindo Fresca tasted like vinegar of course it was bad. Carnitas are old and very dry!! Let's not even talk about the service because the cashier is more concerned about pleasing the cook than taking the order correctly!!,0
"Moving? Watch out for Two Men & a Truck.  On recommendation, we used them and are so sorry we did. Their first estimate was reasonable, but we didn't see the detailed report. The second was for a little more, but we still did not see the detailed report. We were shown the report when the truck arrived for packing, and the crew realized that we had move than a piano, living room and some small rooms. We actually had 11 rooms plus the garage and some outside items. So they called for another truck.We agreed to pay for packing a extra for full coverage. It took two trucks with 5 people over 9 hours to move us 7 miles, and one item was left to be moved the next day. The list of items broken in the move is extensive, including antique furniture, a Fredric Remington bronze statue and an antique silver dish with a handle broken. In addition, there were dirty hand prints on white furniture which we had requested to be shrink wrapped. The list is more extensive, and although they made some minor repairs, they have yet to return calls or emails for many months now on the major, costly items. Oh yes, the final bill was twice the estimate, but what could we then do?Do not use Two Men and a Truck! Tell all your friends.E&J M",0
"Went here for the first time last night. We were sat promptly. The lighting was horrible, moving all over. We ordered nachos with chicken. They looked appetizing, but once we started to eat, they weren't even warm. The chicken tastes canned. We sent it back and they bought another and comped it which was nice. They have a lot of kinks to work out. Oh, and I never got my water. Won't be back.",0
"It's been almost 2 years since our last visit here, see my last review of Jack's.  It seems that nothing has changed much since then. It was 1/2 priced wine night so we thought we'd give the place another go round and order a bottle of wine to go with the Lasagna special. My wife and I came with some neighbors this time in the hope that maybe things had gotten better. Our hopes were dashed. I didn't mention our last trip here to our friends so I wouldn't taint any perceptions. Jack's wait staff is still very nice but the same problem arose with their glasses again.  They were kind of busy and service was a bit slow. When the wine did arrive the waitress poured a sample to taste. Of course after the first visit I checked my glass. This time not only was there orange pulp, but lipstick! I brought this to her attention. She apologized profusely and brought us new glasses and more wine. NOPE, more pulp and more lipstick. I called the manager to the table and shows him. He had a hard time finding us 4 glasses that were clean enough to use.  Long night, this is for sure the last visit to Jack's. Oh, by the way, the Lasagna was adequate at best.",0
"I have been ordering from this location for about 10 years, but something happened tonight that concerned me. I had ordered 2 large orders of wings bone-out and when the delivery came they were all bone-in. I called the location and they asked if I wanted the correct order now or a credit. I chose to have the correct order sent out ASAP. So maybe I am being too careful here, but they asked to have the incorrect order back?? I have no problem showing them the incorrect order, but how are they going to bring food, that has already in someones home, back into their hopefully ""clean restaurant""? That to me, is just plain disgusting and unsanitary!!!",0
"When we go out to dine we expect comfort, good service, and ambience.  Sadly Fat Willies has NONE of these.  It was well over 80 degrees at the bar.  Waitress was slow and had an attitude.  Hot does NOT equal ambience. Our suggestion :  stay away!",0
The last 4 years have not been good to this place. Went back and the place was empty. There were only a couple plates on the rotating bar  and I ventured to try one and it was the definition of room temperature. I didn't risk trying anything else and paid for my plate and left.,0
"Celebrates Halloween Right after Church on Sundaysi was attending this church and just found out they are having a big halloween celebration right after church on sunday! i emailed the pastors including furtick that this is wrong and they said they disagree!i am no longer attending, listening, or giving my tithes. Steven Furtick is very arrogant and will do anything to bring in crowds. i'm praying god deals with them!Warning do not attend this church! They just want your money and to conform with the world to drawn in crowds. Furtick is a millennial still in his party phase!",0
"DISGUSTING - EXPENSIVE - CHEAP - SAD     These are the 4 words that come to mind when I think of this ""lounge"". It is poorly decorated, kept, and managed. You are asked to first pay a $10 cover charge per person and then are immediately put in front of a girl with a cooler selling beers that are overpriced and nothing special. You walk into a room that looks like it was painted by middle school girls. Silver glittery columns, pink splotches everywhere, cheap tables and chairs, and everything else is either painted black or white to hide makeshift stages or walls. The painting of walls inside a club is something I never notice but you can't help but see the laziness and ugliness of it in this place. The decor is so pathetic and cheap as well. The drapes are made to look sexy but actually look like they are made out of your grandmas table cloths. The sitting area to the left as you walk in is so dangerous to walk on and is only bordered with PVC piping and Christmas lights. The DJ was playing music so loud that it was uncomfortable to sit at a table and chair and on the sofas. Everything was vibrating so hard my group of friends all got headaches and were shaking after we left. The bathrooms were the most disgusting thing I have ever seen - I would have rather gone to the bathroom at a gas station. The female toilets had ""water"" all around them high enough to get in my friend's shoes (we prayed it was water). The toilets are either leaking or girls at that bar don't know how to sit on the seat. Mud and toilet paper were all in the water and was spread all over the ground to the sinks. The male restrooms had the door wide open for whatever reason and you could clearly see, from the sitting area, men standing up and going to the bathroom and walking over to the sink. NO PRIVACY - NO CLEANLINESS - NO STANDARDS. The girls working there are made to wear these skimpy outfits and stalk guests into buying tube and jello shots. My group of people were unimpressed, uncomfortable, repulsed, and irritated. How this place stays open and is allowed to have people in it with such gross entities is shocking. Don't waste your money, time, or anything in here - it is AWFUL!",0
"Called ahead to see if they would hold an item. They assured me they would hold 2 hours. Showed up an hour later and they had taken it off hold and sold the item. Very poor customer service.I called to hold at 12:08pm. There was one call that sounded like a fax machine and no one on the line. We spent hundreds at your store, not anymore.",0
"The guy who did my nails did not do a good job at all. It seemed like he did not want to do my nails. The gels are lumpy, nails look fat and immediately started chipping off the next day. He didn't even give me any lotion or oil for my cuticles. I would not recommend this nail salon. See the pictures. Very sloppy",0
"Place is cramped, horrible seating.  This place is not as nice as original, do not understand why Bathroom sink is outside bathroom, it spreads more germs, because people touch handles inside & outside,awful. Food is great, that is all",0
Worst medical billing experience ever.  We just moved to Henderson and my wife needed her yearly scans.  The scans went ok.  At this point we were in an apartment.  We got a bill a month later and filed it to be paid after we moved into our house.  We got into the house and forgot to pay the bill.  We never received another bill because of spotty mail forwarding in this area.  The next bill we received was from a collections agency -- two months after her initial visit?!  What medical provider sends a bill to collections after 60 days?,0
"We walked in and went to the bakery counter.  We waited there for approximately five minutes.  There were two girls working the front counter.  Both were standing at the window where the food comes out of the kitchen.  One girl looked over her shoulder at us, but never acknowledged us.  One of the girls went into the back.  There is a separate line for dine in customers.  Someone walked up to that line and the same girl that looked at us turned and took that person's order.  We left....empty handed.",0
"I will never go here again. Not only did the staff talk down to me because I am a woman by calling me ""hunny"" but they also quoted me a price for back brake repair that was more than double anywhere else. The printed quote that I was give listed parts, labor, and tax for my back brakes to be repaired on my 2011 Chevy Malibu at $695. I knew that was ridiculous so I called 3 of their competitors right across the street who all quoted me between $300-$350. This store will look to take advantage of anyone they can!! DO NOT GO THERE!! There are plenty of other places within the same block that will give a fair price and far better customer service!",0
Just ok..... alcoholic beverages are weak. Lemon drop martini taste like pure lemonade with a sugar rim. How am I suppose to get a buzz of this???Bowling for 2 on a Friday was $40 an 1hr and shoes are $4.00 a pair.,0
They improperly did an oil charge on my car recently. I had to go into the dealership to see what was actually wrong with my vehicle. I was informed that the oil filter was put in incorrectly and has been leaking oil. The only compensation they would offer for my troubles was half off of my next oil change. Why on earth would I go back to a place that can't properly do the task I'm paying them to do?? Poor customer service all around!,0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would! We used the summer day camp program for one week, and it was beyond awful. Children were not properly supervised, activities were not age appropriate, and proper licensing guidelines were not followed. Children were allowed free reign while not being provided engaging activities  or materials thereby creating a recipe for disaster. The ""director"" was unprofessional and not qualified for her leadership position. Her counselors were technically in the room with the children, but nor ""present"" in their supervision. I would recommend that NO ONE use this summer camp or after school program.",0
I was over charged for pizza by $7 and management was terribly rude and refused to correct the mistake. The sad thing was that this was my first time trying this place and the pizza wasn't even good. Too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time or money here.,0
Been craving barbecue stop in there ordered fried pickles they are barely even warm The brisket sandwich is so fatty I can't even eat it! Just wasted $13! They don't even serve sweet tea!,0
"Ugh. There are far better sushi places in Phoenix for the same price that you need to pay here.First off, if you are looking for Shabu Shabu, I would not recommend it here. Our server was completely unhelpful, and seemed so impatient trying to explain how the Shabu Shabu works. The more questions we asked, the more annoyed she became. Definitely big red flag already!Basically in the menu, Shabu Shabu only offers you 1 option. Thinly sliced beef with assorted veggies (some greens, noodles, mushrooms). All this for $30!!!!When we got the dish, I was shocked at how lean the meat was. The cut was no good at all, I felt like I was at some cheap chinese buffet getting ready to eat at the Mongolian BBQ grilling station.The veggies were alright, but I felt the broth was a bit too salty.We ordered some sushi too, but didn't feel that unique to me.I was quite disappointed in this restaurant, given the fact that it's in such a nice area of town.",0
I had my solar installed in the summer of 2015.  It is now the spring of 2016 and my solar still isn't producing energy.  So now I'm paying Erus for the lease and I'm also paying APS full price for electricity (which the snake who signed me up assured me that would never happen). Do not under any circumstances sign with this joke of a solar company.  If there were an option for 0 stars I would do that.,0
"I personally love the food at canes, andante after work I would go to get food here after work, the service was nice and the food was good, but after looking back at my account I noticed I have been double charged for my meals multiple times from this location! Almost every time I have went here I was double charged, which doesn't show on your receipt but shows on your bank account  that's on the cashier.",0
"If I could give no stars I would! This place is a joke! When we first booked our queen suit we paid the deposit and asked how much we would pay when we checked in.  We were told just the remaining balance. We asked if there was going to be any fee holds on our cards or anything extra, and again they said no.  Mind you, we booked directly with the hotel.  After checking in they charged our card $400 more than we were told.  They said it was for just in case we stole from the room. Ok fine whatever. Then we get to the room and my kids take a shower.  Well the shower filled up quickly and flooded the bathroom. We called to let them know and they said someone will be up in a few minutes. While waiting for someone the room was hot and turned the ac down to 65 and no air would blow out and the carpet where the ac is was soaked.  We called about that.  Then the couch had dirty shot glasses behind the pillows.  My boyfriend went and complained to the manager and they switched us rooms, and gave a $75 credit to use only at a few places in the hotel.  The buffet was so not worth the money we spent.  My kids who eat everything didnt like the food or the desserts. One of the workers preparing the desserts sneezed and did not cover her mouth. The customer service overall was lacking. I will never stay here again nor will I refer any friends or family to stay here.",0
"We just had a technician come to our UDC home to look at our heater.  The technician was too heavy to sit on the joist in our attic, and my husband and I watched as the entire ceiling bowed two inches.  My husband asked the technician three times to please come down off the ladder, and he did not.   When he finally came down from the attic, his comment was, ""It's too bad that this home isn't made better.""  We contacted the office and were told by the woman in the office that we were going to have to speak with Old Republic and not them.  They did not offer an apology and were not willing to ask us what happened.  I would NOT recommend this business to anyone.  When Old Republic called us, they said that it would be seven more days before anyone could come back.  We then asked to work with a different contractor who is coming out tomorrow.",0
"Stay away.  Stay FAR away!  Kelly Carn sold a rifle for me on commission...and then pocketed all the money.  I contacted them by phone and one of Kelly's employees told me they sold the gun.  Now they won't pay me.  They have given me the run around for more than a year.  Since I live out of state (I was referred by someone I thought I could trust), it is very difficult for me to go to Las Vegas to file in small claims court.  This man is a scammer.  You have been warned.",0
was going in to try but the police showed up in force so we decided to wait.. this is close to our house so its ghetto.. going to try back later!!,0
I have taken my roomate to the Greenfield location for two MRIs... this is the SLOWEST medical imaging office ever. They tell you to come a half hour early for your appointment and then you still have to wait HOURS!  SO SLOW!  Don't go here if you're in a hurry.... urgency is not this office's strength!,0
"A dump and an embarrassment to all Gap stores. We were in here to look for a few shirts and found nothing because the whole store looked like a tornado hit it. See pics. Clothes were all in a pile, no staff around to help. Steer clear.",0
"I wanted to like this place. It's nice looking, the staff is friendly, and it definitely has appeal with the Wahlberg family name behind it.But restaurants are about food. My wife and my two teenage children ate here. The ""chopped salad"" was just lettuce on a plate, the onion rings had virtually no onions to speak of, and the burgers were flavourless. My daughter liked her Mac and Cheese, but you really have to be incompetent to bung that one up.So expensive, tasteless food? ""Eek! Methinks"" is a well-earned rating. Sad, really, especially with all the smiling faces on the walls and the motto of ""Making you happy, makes us happy"" plastered everywhere. I really felt ripped-off eating here.",0
This was the slowest place I've ever seen! 25 minutes and 2 people in line. I finally gave up and asked for my money back. The staff has no motivation. Never again! I hope a general manager does something about this slow ass place!,0
Had been here many times before during happy hour. I guess they stopped doing it just a few weeks ago. Thanks for still advertising that you DO have have it. Literally doubled my bill. Will NOT be returning. Ever.,0
"This is probably the worst wingstop location I've ever been to. The customer service was ridiculously  bad. Cashiers and workers visibly looked miserable and I understand employees are people too and have bad days, but the direct rudeness to me was not acceptable. Food also took 45 minutes after I ordered.",0
Terrible service no drink refill service after the first drink is served. Plates are left there u till there is a huge pile. Food is exceptionally good but service is crap. Lines were a pain in the butt. First u get in line for a wait list. Then u wait again to pay and wait an extra 30 mins to get a table. Come early if u don't want to be waiting in line.,0
"I was in Toronto for work on Cinqo de Mayo and wanted to get out for some good Mexican food with my coworkers. A couple searches netted this place, which looked decent, had a nice menu plus full bar service. We made reservations for dinner expecting it to be busy but when we arrived the place was not that crowded. Our group of 5 was seated in a really tight booth in the corner of the restaurant. From there it got more interesting. First, the chips and salsa did not arrive for almost 10 minutes. Then drinks took about another 10 minutes and they never came back to refill our chips - leaving us to forage for leftovers from another table. When they finally came to take our order the time it took to prepare the food was ridiculous for a Mexican restaurant. We ordered burritos, enchiladas and fajitas so nothing should have taken too long to prepare. Yet our food took 45 minutes to arrive. At one point our server stopped by and seemed surprised that our food was not out yet. Not exactly a confidence builder. Then when the food did arrive they didn't know which burrito was which so we had to cut them open to see who had shrimp, chicken and beef. Some of the food was cold and one order was totally wrong. It's amazing to me that a Mexican place could be so bad on Cinqo de Mayo.The Good:- guacamole made tableside- drinks, good selectionThe Bad:- very slow service- many mistakes and confusion on the orders- small tables, not balanced",0
Cleaner rescheduled at the last minute and didn't move anything to clean. Owner was indifferent when i emailed to ask if this was normal business practice. Way too expensive for the job that was done.,0
"Made a reservation, got seated in no time. Had the lobster wontons in ginger broth which was pretty good. For entree I had the typhoon lobster. The lobster was delicious and surprisingly big. I had one piece of the tail and couldn't eat anymore so I asked the waiter to pack it to go. By the time I got to my hotel and checked my leftovers, only potatoes and one piece of lobster was in the plate. I have no idea what they did to the remainder of what was left but I paid for it, therefore nothing should have been missing. Real disappointment and it's hard for me to eat there again considering they showed me they are not trustworthy. When you're paying over $200 for two people to eat, they should have more respect for their customers!!!",0
"They need more checkers, 10 people in line behind a woman with issues that took 20 min. to resolve. And the chastise didn't call for extra help.",0
Second time I've been here and the won't do services they are claiming they do. Before it was shipping an item now it's notarizing a document. You can initial the scratches out item banks do it all the time. Either way you've lost all my business even from my company I own.,0
"My wife and I had heard good things about Lavo, so we gave it a try. Maybe it was bad luck or an off night, but the chicken parmigiano dinners we both ordered were both so mediocre, we both stopped trying to eat them half way through. They were surprisingly gristly, especially for that kind of money. What really turned us off is that the manager refused to adjust the bill, as though the experience was somehow our fault. My default before resorting to Yelp is to contact the restaurant's customer service, but after a month they haven't bothered to respond. I hope you have better luck than we did.",0
VERYYYYYY slowwww...if you are in no hurry this is worth a shot.  Good food and decent music.,0
"If I could give zero stars I would! I've been coming here to watch movies for as long as I can remember  I went to Galaxy theater last night to watch the one time celebration of Friday with Ice Cube and Chris Tucker. Tickets=22$, 2 sodas=10.50, and not to mention the gas and time that it took to get dress and drive up to the movie theater.  The employees there didn't even turn the lights down until someone went and complained and then about 10 minutes into the movie. I opened my phone to check in on Facebook that I was at the theater. I had my phone open for maybe a minute before a short pudgy girl came up to me and said ""come with me!"" like a Nazi. My boyfriend was confused and followed. When I got out there the girl said in a unfeeling tone. ""I have to escort you out. you can't use your phone""  My response was "" No warning?"" Her response was,"" I'm sorry you have to leave.""  Ten minutes into the movie! Am I going crazy? Or is this the most callus way to do business anyone has ever seen in their life? All of my money and  time wasted and no warning? I spoke to the manager who was also a child and she said "" we have no tolerance."" I thought "" no tolerance for customers having a good time obviously."" She then arrogantly said ""Miss there are warnings signs everywhere like this sign right here and the introduction before the movie (which also NEVER happened ... not that it would make this any less callus) Someone above her head is really not running there business well. Not only that the whole place is run by children who have no idea how to conduct real customer service. Come on people. What is the world coming to? Get it together. I came to watch a movie. Not get harassed by a bunch of Nazis in movie theater uniforms who are treat you like you're a criminal!",0
"I have to say the clientele at this pub is as friendly as I have ever seen. The bartender working the night shift is another story. Bad, Bad attitude. Totally took away from the experience. Won't be returning.",0
"I ordered pizza, fries, chicken fingers with ranch, and a two liter of Dr Pepper. The food was ok, upon arrival the delivery driver handed me my food and no soda so I asked about the soda. His was response was oh sh*t I forgot it and he left and said he'll be back. 40 mins later I had soda to go along with the meal I already finished.",0
Did the restaurant change managers? I order there at least once a week and have never had an issue. My order was wrong when I picked it up the other night and no apology what so ever. Very disappointed with the managers comment as he walked by me. I was totally inconvenienced by having to drive back to the restaurant to have them make my order over. My only option.,0
"If you like to go home and find a Chicken Nugget Kids Meal...without the chicken nuggets.  If you like watching employees behind the counter checking their emails on their iPhones and then eating fries while you are waiting for your order.  If you like a cheeseburger without cheese and a Diet Coke instead of the Dr. Pepper you ordered....this is your McDonalds!!  Today was the final step when I drove back to the store to recover my son's missing nuggets and the employee said 'we were wondering why these were sitting there for so long.' He then proceeded to hand the stale 15+ minute old nuggets to me and then walk away without an apology.  I laughed and walked out. Our neighborhood enjoys sharing stories about this location.  The lack of service is almost at a level of sitcom humor.  They will continue to get the Hwy.84 traffic business, but Weddington and Wesley Chapel folks are 95% done with the WC McD's.  You will notice 7-10 cars in the Chick-Filet drive-thru across the street for every 1-2 cars in the Wesley Chapel McDonalds drive-thru.  Hope they change it into an Arby's?",0
"We chose A1 based on all of the 5 star Yelp reviews. I cannot recommend them based on my experience. They made multiple trips to our home. The first time, the tech states he can repair our garage door without replacing it.  He tells us the door will last a long time. The door fails again 2 weeks later.  A1 returns to temporarily fix the door (for an additional charge) until a new garage door can be ordered. We received a quote that seemed high. We asked for a discount  considering all we went through.  Tech tells us to call the manager in the morning. We call in the morning and speak to a manager. Manager says he will call us back to discuss potential compensation. Never heard from the manager or A1 again. After this level of service, we  did not want to reward them by buying a garage door from them. We decided to go with another company on Yelp. The new company's quote was much lower than A1's and included a more expensive motor that had more options.  Unlike A1, the painting of the door was done that day. A1 told us they could not guarantee when the door would be painted because it was outsourced to a third party and said it would probably be the following week. I felt that was pretty inconvenient.",0
"Watch out.  I rented a car from here and one month later a claims company contacted me for damages that were not caused by me:  (a) claims company has different rental agreement number than mine, and (b) claim was made 5 days after I had rented the car.  To compound the issue, the claims company is not responsive, Budget Phoenix manager has not responded to my calls and Budget corporate customer service email service punted to aforementioned.  Next steps, BBB and other channels....",0
"It's hard to pick which was the worst part of my last meal at Zoe's.  I used to eat at Zoe'a anywhere from 1-3 times a week - always the tossed Greek salad.  And almost every week, it arrives (I generally order thru Postmates for lunch) different than the last time.  Sometimes it has pasta salad in it, sometimes potato salad. Sometimes cucumbers, often not.  Sometimes no olives, which is particularly strange for a 'Greek' salad...But this last week was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.  For about the 6th time in the last 6-8 months, the salad arrived without one of the main ingredients - the grilled chicken and onions combo.  This is a tough one to forget, being a main ingredient and all.  But much to my surprise, this wasn't even the worst part of this delivery.I called the location to let them know they forgot the chicken.  Additionally, I wanted them to know that these screw-ups occur way to often for an item like this.  It would be like ordering a hamburger at McDonalds and getting your order without the meat (and let's not debate whether that is meat or not....)I asked to speak to the manager on duty.  He gets on the phone, I tell him what has happened, gave him background about how often this has happened - and that if they can't fix the problem, I'm going to have to stop ordering from Zoe's, despite the fact that I really like the food.  But getting the order wrong almost all the time is just frustrating.  The assistant manager offers me a free salad.  This is great, and I'm grateful for that - but what I really want is for them to just make the salad right, and I explain this to the manager.So here is where it just goes off the rails.  The manager proceeds to tell me I should be more grateful for a free salad, and that he isn't on the actual cook line and can't check that every order is made perfectly.I was speechless.  It actually took me a second to process what the 'manager' just said - he's not on the line, therefore can't verify or be responsible for the quality of the product of the location - he is in charge of.   It come to think of it, he might have said he was the assistant manager, so maybe that explains it....Needless to say, Zoe's is not just off my menu, but my department's lunch menu as well.....Edit - I can't seem to reply to you, Bethany, so while I appreciate your offer, I am going to decline.  I forgot to mention another issue in my review.  Since the assistant manager was less than polite or helpful, I asked to speak to the overall manager.  He said she (I think it was a she) was out and back in tomorrow.  I said it is very important that she call me, given the repeated issues.  I gave him my number, but she never called.  That was really the last straw, and why my company won't be ordering from Zoe's any longer as well.",0
"Dr. Ralph Wilson should not be allowed to practice Dentistry.  He performed a simple implant procedure and put the implant through the nerve of the other tooth.  I have been through 10 years of corrective dental work by an Endodontist, Prosthodontist, oral surgeons and other Periodontists. Thousands of dollars for this one mistake.  The only plus was he admitted his error.  Obviously, mistakes happen but if it was more than he was capable of, perhaps he should have had another Dentist do the work!  Perhaps Dentistry in a third world country would be a good place for this guy!",0
"We ate here today at the suggestion of friends we are visiting. We were very disappointed... my burger was over cooked - at $16.95 I was not happy, my husband had a club sandwich and asked for ham instead of chicken. This very expensive club sandwich came out with 1 slice of ham on each piece of bread. Not a good sandwich at all. To add insult to injury, my husband and I ordered a Diet Coke for each of us and when we asked for a refill we were told they don't give free refills. Really?  At $3.00 per drink there was not even one refill. We will definitely not be going back to this place again. The only thing nice I can say is our server was very nice. If you're looking for good portions of food or free refills just skip right over this place.",0
"Looks like a great store, with reasonable prices - I wanted to get a bouquet primarily based on snapdragons.  I priced out what would be reasonable based on the listed prices, and was told that they have a 2.50 fee PER FLOWER to arrange (meaning take out of the container and wrap in paper) - more than doubling the cost.  I was ready to spend 90 bucks for 2 simple bouquets.  I have never experienced a flower shop do this.  Most of the time, I walk into a shop, state what I'd like and a price range l, and they would pick and choose for me, making a beautiful paper wrapped bouquet - and charge the per flower price listed.  The guy at this shop simply said ""not going to happen"" and walked away.  At least he could have been nicer.Such a shame, it seemed to get good reviews, and is conveniently located.*** turns out the picture I put up was of the wrong guy.  Trying to remove!",0

This is the worst place if you are short on time. I come here just to deposit my rent into landlords account. There are never more than 2 people working. Takes 20+min every month just to deposit rent. I bank across the street at Wells Fargo and never have to wait. I recommend everyone switch banks....why deal with this when there are options in life,0
"Just from the food perspective, YUCKKKKKK! HELLLL NO! I was SOOOOO EAGER about visiting this place only because of the gorgeous pictures and OBVIOUSLY MISLEADING reviews! The setting, decor, ambiance, YES!! It's feminine, elegant somehow without being pretentious, refreshing, and inviting. But telllllll me how the food is so disgraceful! I preordered 18 cupcakes (1 of every flavour and then some), and 5 macarons. FIRST OF ALL, THE CHEF NEEDS TO GO BACK TO CULINARY SCHOOL AND PERHAPS ENGLISH SCHOOL TO RELEARN THE DEFINITION OF A CUPCAKE AND RECOGNIZE ITS DISTINCT DIFFERENCE FROM A MUFFIN! I ordered cupcakes and got muffins -_- their cupcakes are DRY, THICK, AND STIFF...akin to a muffin. And they taste bland, akin to paper. I thought I bit into the papershell initially, nope. That's a feat in and of itself actually, how do you make the combination of  flour & sugar taste like a textbook? Good on you.The macarons weren't as terrible, but they left an awful aftertaste! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.",0
"I placed an order for a pie and instead of notifying me right away, they waited until my pick up time to tell me that they weren't going to be able to get it done. Will not ever be using them ever again.  I would give them 0 stars if it was an option.",0
"Owner of the salon was simply put, mean and inconvenienced. She forgot about my color and cut appointment and then worked me in and acted like I inconvenienced her.  Then charged me a lot $$$$$ for her own reasons why she needed to. crap hair cut and crap blow out. Wasn't worth the money. She was harsh on my head with color and hair brushing and I'm hard headed. It felt like mommy dearest hitting me on the head with a hair brush. Angry snobby for no good reason.  Even attitude to her own employees. Thought I'd just give it whirl it's just hair right?  I should check reviews more often.",0
"Was craving a milkshake today for lunch, went to stop by at this coldstone after grabbing some chipotle next door and to my surprise this location was closed. No sign on the door other than the hours stating they would be open during that time. It seems like whoever runs this business doesn't care about customers or being punctual. Guess I'll take my business elsewhere.",0
"This place suuuucks!!!! I came here one time and the bartender/manager is the biggest douchebag ever. I came in with three other girls. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and apps. I asked if I could just have a small house salad, not a huge Pittsburgh salad, with everything in it, etc. This guy was the biggest jerkoff. He immediately cocked an attitude and said if it's not on the menu, we aren't doing it. I also will add, we were THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE PLACE. I continued to state my request and he wouldn't budge. A kind bar-back over heard this exchange and said ""um, it's not a big deal, we can make a side salad, we do it all the time."" The prick scoffs at us and then says to the bar-back, ""if you want to deal with it, you do it."" I made sure to hand that nice guy a twenty bucks for helping me out. The very best was when the salad was ready, this asshole was the one to serve it to me. I said very condescending, ""there...that wasn't very hard now was it?"" On another occasion, friends went there and sat at the bar and said this same guy served them warm bar, refused to take it off the bill, and laughed at them when they complained. Not sure if this guy works here is related to owner or what, but he is one arrogant fuckboy.",0

This cvs really does deserve all the low ratings.  They are very busy but disorganized and probably that's why they have such a no can do attitude in their pharmacy.    I was in town for a Tempe conference but forgot my CVS meds written in San Diego. Needed two days worth.   First no one helps me in the consult line and so I wait in wrong line.  Then they say they cannot do intrastate prescrip transfers even CVS to CVS.   After waiting in line again I find out I can buy a few tablets to cover my 2 day stay.   Well that's all I wanted!   But I had to dig and fight they their no can do attitude.   Like I said they're busy so that's probably why there so unhelpful.,0
"Really? is this what we call BBQ, The name ""Memphis"" shouldn't even be mentioned on a restaurant like this, wow! what a disgrace, let me explain. First when I got there the girl at the register acted as if she didn't even know the menu, and then could'nt understand my order or a request that I asked for, the owner was back there cooking but didn't acknowledge me as customer (which is bad business!), so when I finally tasted the food, I was sorely dissappointed, the rib tips tasted old and rubbery and like they were shipped from somewhere, the cole slaw was nasty and old tasting, and the fries were less than sub par-I can go on and on but I'll keep it short. This place should be ashamed for giving there customers slop .Why such a review? Well honesty is the best outcome, and I'm just being honest and people should know what they will get if they go to this place. Also I think now more than ever money is not easy to come by, and this is what the owner should keep closely in mind when serving and advertising what is to be good food when it is absolutely not, if I wanted bad food I could get it from the garbage I should'nt have to waste my gas and get it from a restaurant. So my recommendation for BBQ would be to either do it yourself or invest your money with Honeybears BBQ here in town.Quality: sub-parSauce: no good, chemical tasteFries: not goodMeat: no go! why? perhaps the owner warms it up in the microwave (really?)Advice: if a restaurant is empty, then that is your clue to go somewhere else.",0

Came here with a group of kids on a Field trip from Tucson. Had a very unpleasant experience the Manager Donnie( at least I believe that's his name as he yelled across the restaurant) was upset because we arrived later than expected on the bus. Another adult and myself went to go in and order separate from the previously order items in the group we were told we were not able to order since we were late and he had another large group coming soon. Again I believe that is what he was yelling across the restaurant filled with lots of background noise! With No customers in it because he wasn't allowing them to seat or serve anyone else either? (Very professional ‍) Btw when I saw my child's chicken strips that she ordered they were over cooked and hard as a rock maybe from being kept warm under the lamps? Since he was so busy with a different group arriving soon? I'm sorry aren't you a restaurant at a busy tourist location in the middle of the week nonetheless. I'd hate to see how this so called manager handles a weekend of stress.I will give him at least he was nicer to the kids and the teachers when he brought them their food. Nonetheless We Took our Business to Pangaea Grill! They were more than happy to take my order and $! Even with a big party in their restaurant!,0

Horrible experience here for a group weekday lunch.  We waited over 1.25 hours with no food.  The excuse was not enough staff in the kitchen.  Stay away.,0
No wonder I never came to downtown Las Vegas. It sucked. My husband and I decided to come here and try their famous deep fried oreos and twinkies. They were ok but I don't think we wil be going back for seconds. We heard so many rave reviews from people so we thought we had to check it out. NOT... I am not returning to this place. This place is dirty and reminds me of Reno. There was a bunch of people there that looked like they were smoking crack... Totally not my kind of scene. The snack bar serves cheap food so I guess that is what keeps those crack heads coming --cheap food and cheap drinks.,0

"William was responsive when I first called and I was paying, but now that I have a problem he is not taking my calls to do his warranty work.I had him do work on a subzero fridge and a subzero freezer  in September 2014.  On my fridge he repaired the evaporator with a one year warranty.  After 11 plus months it started leaking again.  I left several messages and finally he answered his phone.   It took about a month to get him to come out and look at it.  He says it need the evaporator replaced and I have to pay for the part but the labor is covered.  I said fine, no problem, let's do it.  It's been about a month now and I can't seem to get him out to finish his repairs.  He told me he would be here on Tues 11/10/15 between 9 and 10.   He never showed.  No call.  Nothing.

"On 2/14/14 we went to this location to have a kid friendly Valentines night.  Our night was completely ruined after waiting for over an hour for our food (still left without eating) and being verbally assaulted by the GM Darius Steen who felt it necessary to scream at my fiancee ""what do you think this is?  this is not fast food, its pizza.""  A little much being it is pizza and should take maybe 20minutes.  While checking on our food, which had not even been started after an hour, apparantly this irritated Darius further who decided he needed to also scream across the kitchen from the pizza making station, ""Ive been working here 15years and probably make more money than you.""  Totally rude and not professional to anyone, especially to someone who is a customer.  We also contacted Peter Pipers main office regarding this incident and behavior to never get a response.  Apparantly this company condones this kind of disgusting behavior.  Will NEVER return.",0
The salad was average but the salmon was awful! It was over priced for what you get and how you get it (cafeteria style),0
"Definitely a place to avoid.  Hopefully it is short lived.  Food actually used to be good, not any longer.  Prices are as other reviewers have noted, absurdly high.  Service is not good.  The salsa,,,bland.  And being the room is small and there were several business diners who have not the tact to keep their voices down, the place was deafening.

On top of that when he answered the phone he said ""hello?""  No name, no nothing. I understand That it is a low-paying job, but how about giving a shit.  To top it all off, the entire box is ice cold. I mean ice cold. Not even moderately warm.

"We got take out from this place (via Just Eat) and they forgot one (of only two) main dishes. We called to complain and I overheard the lady who answered talking to the manager in the background, to say they were disinterested is probably given them more credit than is due.Further to that the quality was terrible and they loaded it up with bread and little else. To make matters worse, for Ethiopian it was expensive. My fiance is from Sudan and we eat East African food multiple times a week. So we know good shit. I think many people who aren't knowledgeable about such cuisine get caught up in the novelty of it all to realize the portions, quality and service at this place is utter crap.If I could give this place zero stars I would.",0
"We purchased a Ford Focus for my daughter and it was, overall, a good experience. But then the transmission began to slip within the warranty period.  We took the Focus back to Horne to have them bring the Focus to a shop to be looked over.  The shop claimed they couldn't find anything wrong.  A couple days later the problem became worse and the transmission light came on.  This time my daughter took a video of the RPM needle in the 4000 range when I was only doing 20 mph.  I emailed the video to Oscar, the sales guy.  I never heard back from him and when I asked him about it over the phone he said he never received an email from me.  This is now the second time we have brought the Focus back to Horne.  My daughter showed Oscar the video and he mentioned that what he received from me was blurry (He told me he never received an email).  A couple days later we went back to Horne and talked with the manager, Mike.  He said that a new transmission would cost to much (mind you the car was still within the warranty period).  He suggested that he trade us out of the Focus.  He then went on to state that he and a couple of buyers who would go to auction and look for something comparable to the Focus.  Well, several days went by and no communication from Horne.  We did discover that we could look for other cars at Horne Auto in Gilbert.  We did find a couple of cars and Mike at Horne Mesa filled his boss, Dan, at Horne Gilbert, in on the situation.  Mike told my wife and I to let him know when we were going to go to Horne in Gilbert and he would meet us up there.  Mike never showed.  However, Dan, was a pleasure to work with.  As it turned out we couldn't be traded out of the current deal so Dan contacted the owner of Horne who said to fix the transmission(like it should have been from the beginning). This is where things with Horne Motors of Mesa started to get ugly.  My 16 year old daughter dropped the car off at Horne for the repair work.  While she was waiting for her ride home the following occurred (this is her actual text message to me):""Okay so Oscar came up to me and he was like ""I personally don't trust new transmissions the car never runs the same."" ""Your family shouldn't have to be going through this bs"" and I said well yeah you should have fixed it a long time ago."" He said "" have your dad call mike the manager and tell him to push the issue and to get you guys a car because you all work full time and shouldn't have to worry about this car"" He then pointed to a jeep and said he could see me in that and it is a lot cuter than the focus. then he said to leave his name out of everything because he doesn't want to be out of a job. And he also told me my car would be sitting in the lot for a week without even being touched. And the whole process would take about two weeks so we're better off trading for the jeep. AND THEN HE OFFERED ME A RIDE HOME TWICE""if I were you I would just trade for the Jeep Liberty because honestly it's better than the piece of sh*t that you have. "" and I said well no we want the car that you promised us you would fix for us"" and then he was like ""I know about your parents credit and how it's f***ed up."" And I was like no how about you fix the car you sold us like you said you would and he was like yeah okay well your boyfriends here and he literally walked away.""My daughter called Horne of Mesa later that day and spoke with Mike, the manager about a loaner car.  She brought up the subject of the Focus sitting for a week without being touched.  Mike then yelled out to Oscar asking him why he would tell a customer that since Mike is trying to get the car fixed as quickly as possible.  About 15 minutes later my daughter gets a phone call from Oscar, who is on his personal mobile phone, asking her why she would throw him under the bus like that and that he was now suspended from work. At this point my daughter's boyfriend took the phone and started telling Oscar how unprofessional and rude that he was being.  Oscar then hung up on the boyfriend. Not once did I, my daughter, or my wife give Oscar my teenage daughters phone number. Horne of Mesa was unable to get the Focus into the shop until after the weekend so we were told we could come and use it for the next couple of days.  On Saturday morning I went with my daughter to pick up the car.  Mike was standing outside more interested in a tractor across the street then in answering my questions.  When I asked him why Oscar was suspended he looked at me like I was crazy (I knew that Oscar was never suspended).  Fast forward to Monday and my daughter dropped the car off to be fixed.  This time her grandparents went with her as I didn't want her going alone.  Both Mike and Oscar were very RUDE.  Mike didn't say one word to them and Oscar almost knocked my father over, who uses a walker, coming out of the dealership door.  He didn't even say excuse me. ****AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP AT ALL COSTS****",0
"Terrible customer service from the woman who answers their phone. I had a service call scheduled, however, my bell wasn't working (I didn't know), and I missed the technician.  We received a text from the technician that nobody was home. I was home, and immediately called the business line asking if the tech could turn around, and explained that the bell didn't work.  The woman told me she needed to call the tech. She did, and returned my call saying the tech was already too far, and that he couldn't come back. I responded with a sigh and an ok. The woman told me that the tech had been banging on my door, and even shouting for someone to come to the door. I told her that this is impossible since I have a gate, and no access to the door to bang on. I also said I doubt the tech was out there screaming for me to answer (lol who does that).  She than told me that the tech made a call before he was on his way, and a second call at the door. This is also untrue. We just received one text saying nobody was home.  All these untruths from the woman on the phone, made me not want to reschedule with this company.  On a side note, the tech did reach my husband asking if we would like to reschedule.  He seemed very nice and professional, but still going elsewhere.",0
Manager in this store does not speak very nicely with his customers.  Not enough staff to help clients.  Only one person works the copy centre when i was there.  Long line.  Corporate needs to have a look here.,0
"I am so extremely upset with this business I don't know how they are going to keep customers if they continue to treat customers the way I was treated today.  We purchased a POGO pass via Groupon and refused to allow my children to play because ""they can only play if you purchase an adult pass"" I had zero need to play simple was accompanying my 6 and 9 year old.   I offered to wait in the lobby while they jumped and played; still my children were denied access.   So I was forced to pay when we had already purchased passes just to allow my children to play.  I sat in a chair supervising my kids while their staff were repeatedly checking their cell phone and jokes among each other paying no attention to the children play or safety hazards.  Completely unprofessional customer service and rude staff member. I will not return to this place ever again and I will tell my friends and family of the terrible experience we had at TJ this place.",0
"Nice looking restaurant inside and out. Fairly clean when Ive been there. Unfortunately the service is unbelievably horrible. Wait times are terribly long every day no matter the time of day. Workers are unpleasant, slow and have no sense of urgency like every other Wendy's I have been to. They all are kind of just ""hanging out"". This business could be making double or triple the profit with a few personnel and management changes.",0
Ordered the flautas as a recommendation of the guy taking the orders. Was not happy that I had to wait almost 30 minutes for the food. The guacamole didn't taste good. The prices were a little high.,0
"I just moved to Vistancia, so I was excited that there is a Spa close by, waited two weeks for my appointment for a gel manicure.  After having this service elsewhere,and disappointed in how long the gel actually lasted.  I was assured by Alvea that would not be the case there.  The facility is beautiful & clean.....receptionist was   friendly. My appointment was the last one of the day on a Saturday.  The tech was somewhat  friendly, she let me know she was ready to go home, so she sped through gel manicure.  Which she did not do the manicure part,  just gel process, but no manicure.  My nails were so sloppily done, there was product all over my skin & underneath my nails.  When I went to pay it was $55.00, more than I was told....they called it a full set, but that was not so, for it was over my own nails.  I then noticed all the crap still on my skin, and told the receptionist.  She escorted me back to the tech, she was less than pleased, told me I was picky.  She herself could not get product off my skin, It took a week for it to wear off.  Sloppy job!!! :(  Needless to say I took the gel off a few weeks later......for I am a cosmetologist.  It has trashed my nails, would not recommend.  Would not go back to Alvea Spa for nail service, very hesitant to try any other services.  I wanted to ask for my money back, due to bad experience, but did not......too stressful to deal with. Tech was less than professional, and did not act like she appreciated my being there.  Grateful to hear other clients have had good experiences.....that is hopeful for the Spa.",0
"Re Salon has some awesome stylist and med spa techs but that rude older receptionist will end up costing them customers. I've ignored her awful, curt remarks on every visit but after yesterday I had to post a review. She needs to be removed from that position. She can't multitask without acting stressed and treating the customers checking in and out like they are a hassle. She's is going to end up costing that place.",0

"This place had generally good reviews, but I had an entirely different experience. It was a very disappointing.A friend and I had decided to go because we wanted to try their dim sum. I had heard from friends that it was great. We walked in about 12:15 and did not leave until about 2:30. In my opinion, that is way too long for an hour lunch break.We walked in and it was very hectic. The waitresses were yelling and the tables were still dirty from the customers who had left. We went up to the counter to order, but she told us to sit down with our menu. We saw a bunch of people walk in and order at the counter so we filled in our sheet and brought it up. At this point it was about 12:30 before she even took our sheet because the waitress were taking care of the customers who had just walked in. So we sat there and waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes had gone by and nothing. 40 minutes. Nothing. We were very upset because we only had a short lunch break. About 43 minutes later, our first dish came out. Slowly, our little dim sum dishes came out. One by One. Our dishes were being thrown on the table without care and the waitress just left without telling us what it was. We went up to get some hot tea as well and both containers were completely empty. We to complain and the manager said that this was a new girl and she didn't really have a handle on things yet. Our last dish came about 45 minutes later from our first dish. A few of the dim sum dishes were really tasty, but it did not make up for lack of management and service skill. I do not think that I'll ever be returning.",0

"Terrible hotel!  My friend was given the wrong room # on his card and had to go back to the front desk for the right room no.  Bars are either understaffed or bartenders are arrogant.  I spent about $150 sitting at the bar for two hrs and they didnt comp one drink.  I am in Vegas, right?  Wifi in room is very unstable.   My room faces a catwalk so I have to keep my blinds closed all the time.  I called for a wake up call last night. Operator transferred me to someone who answered and had no idea what I was talking about.  She handed the phone to someone else who was clueless, too.  I hung up, burst out laughing at how bad this place is. I swear I'm not making this all up!If service is supposed to be at its pinnacle when a place is new (especially in Vegas), imagine this place in a year or two!  Never again.",0
"I am literally giving one star because the sales guy, Josue, was actually very nice otherwise I'd figure out a way to give zero stars. I spent all day yesterday talking with Mike Woody over email and text. I told him exactly what my situation was and that I was putting nothing down and I was upside down on my trade in. I told him exactly where I wanted to be for price before I even committed to driving out there. Finally, I agree to make the 45 minute drive to have them look at my car (I told him exactly how upside down I was based on the trade in value I'd been given from other dealers) because I felt confident that Mike had a super clear understanding of what my situation was. I drive there, test drive a 2018 Jeep that I loved, sit down to talk numbers (after being told twice that they had already run my credit) only to find out that they were $150-$200 a month above where I wanted to be. They also wanted me to come up with 7k for a down payment. Excuse me??? But what part of the situation did Mike not understand? I don't think I've ever been so livid in my whole life. Mike literally wasted my time on a deal he had to know they couldn't make. I will just pay my car down a bit more and trade in next year or so. I WILL NOT ever return to this dealer and I'll tell everyone I know about this. Absolutely ridiculous.",0
"GOOD LUCK! Completely what I expect from a crappy dealership.  Me and my wife were looking to buy a used truck and trade in our car. I had one used truck they had posted online for about a week that I wanted to test drive.  I let the internet sales manager know over the phone I was not looking to haggle, play games, or waste their time and especially mine,  and of course he tells me I have better buying power if I come into the dealership ( a game crappy dealerships play to get you in so they can jerk you around).  We then agree to a 6 p.m. appointment to test drive the one specific truck I inquired about-- (I knew I shouldn't have, but thought maybe they were different than most dealerships)--HUH!   We pull up and are treated like bait instantly with un-professional salesmen.  I knew something wasn't right when the internet sales manager couldn't look me in the eyes. He takes me to the salesman's desk and we wait about 5 min till the salesman comes out and acts like he doesn't know what used vehicle I was there to test drive, and after we tell him what we're there for he then tells us he will go pull it up front for the test drive.  About 20 min. later he comes back and says ""Has anybody told you where I've been"", we say no and he replies ""I've been looking for the keys and the truck is in the dent and paint bay which is locked up"" he continues with these stupid Q's after--""What year was the truck you were looking at"" --I reply I'm not sure-- reason being they had a '08 and '07 used Dodge Dakota's for sale.  I then reply-- the one with lower mileage on it, he replies ""I don't know which one that is, all I remember is that there is an automatic and a manual"".  I reply-- the manual was the one with lower miles- which is the one I'm here to test drive.  He says ""Yep, they are putting on the tailgate and we will have it out in just a minute"" then he walks away.  So at this point I'm a little frustrated they didn't have the truck ready when I got there--- 7 hours after our initial conversation on the phone.  My wife then says-- he didn't say it was the manual, he just said Yep.  We then wait about another 10 min, until I turn around and through tinted glass in the office area I see our salesman hanging out looking bored as hell and at this point I realize this dealership is just like most--- full of crap!  I ask someone to get him for me then this is where shit hit the fan!  He comes strolling out and I ask him---do you know if the truck we are waiting for is a manual or an automatic!?  He replies ""I'm not %100 sure but it should be out in a minute then we'll go for the test drive""!  OMG- my wife was right, he ran around my previous question, and at this point I give him my- I'm about to be pissed off look! I then say--- can you go check!? , because the manual is the one I'm her to test drive!  He replies, ""it should be here any minute"", then he boldishly tries to make me feel stupid and says this with a caulky attitude, ""Unless you want me to meet it halfway between the shop and here""!  I reply--- YEAH I would, I'm here to test drive the manual and the internet sales manager knew this!  He says ""OK"" with a roll of his eyes then he leaves again, a minute later some other guy comes to the desk and says, ""Sorry about the wait, the truck was being painted and it got locked up and we just got it out"".  I explained to the man that we are here to look at a manual Dodge Dakota and your salesman says he's not sure if it's manual or automatic. Then guy says ""It's an automatic, the manual was sold about 4 hours ago"".  Me and my wife got up and walked out the door!  Now, a decent dealership would have at least called me when the truck was sold and explained just that, but not even that basic courtesy was applied.  Then, treating me as though I'm stupid, wasting my time and having me drive 20 miles to see if they could convince me to buy another one of their vehicles tells me they are extremely unprofessional and their whole dealership is most likely managed  improperly.  The sad thing is that Midway owns almost all of the dealerships within that mile stretch of Bell Rd. and that means all of those dealerships are most likely ran the same way! So sad!  All I can think to say is a saying my 5 year old son says when somebody is being wronged, ""remember the golden rule""! Remember, don't be fooled with from dealerships like Volvo of Phoenix and check out---   www.autocheatsheet.com and open your mind to the way most dealerships are, it is completely free as far as I know and created by an ex-dealership owner!",0
"This is the most manipulative company I have ever dealt with, EVER! They change their story every time I call over there and take advantage of the consumers. When I first signed up with them they gave me one quote...then the agent called me back and said, I'm so sorry but your insurance quote has gone up a little due to a claim...a windshield replacement claim...seriously? So then they told me to c/b on a certain date that the claim would drop off and they would make an adjustment to my policy! So I did...guess what? NO adjustment! These people have the worst customer service and care ZERO about their customers. STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM PROGRESSIVE! They are a rip off!",0
"I wouldn't bother with this place.  First of all I really question the cleanliness in this place and how well they sterilize their tools.  Alcohol seemed to be non-existent.  I got a classic pedicure but there was nothing ""classic"" about  it.  I saw that that had pictures of nail art but when I asked the technician If he could do a basic flower he said it was too complicated.  Twice I had to tell him he was hurting my leg during the massage.  When he finished I asked him to remove the excess polish on my toe and he kept added more polish to my toe nail.  I'd read the current reviews and save your money.  Wish I had before coming here.",0
Terrible customer service!!! We waited almost 40 min to be served than our waiter was talking to other tables and ignoring us the most of the time.... our food came out gross and hard. DO not come to this location!,0
"THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING!!! I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food is disgusting and the restaurant just looks nasty. The servers are extremely attentive, polite, and well educated on the menu. However the management of this restaurant is horrible. They are extremely disrespectful and rude. I do not think that this place is going too last very long, due to the management. When my food came out it was nothing but oil and grease in my boil bag. The flavors of the sauces are not good at all, and I do not believe that the seafood is fresh, nor is it being stored properly or cleaned properly. My daughter is currently throwing up because something she ate, it was either not cooked all the way or bad. I will not be coming back ever again, and I will be letting all of my friends know to not visit this place.",0
"Really not sure what the hype is about this place. The cocktail list is okay, I order the finishing schoolI think it's called and it was just okay. The service was good, but the atmosphere lacked - it was full of old men smoking cigars. To me this did not reflect glamour or elegance. I personally think the cosmopolitain itself is really over rated and has become like some of the other over priced establishments on the strip.",0
"I went to Pogue Mahone's after a work BBQ for drinks with 8 other people. From the beginning, our server (Victoria) was off-putting. She called us ""honey,"" ""sweetie,"", ""dear,"" and the likes which could have been easily brushed off. However, she cut my boss off mid-sentence several times as she was trying to speak to Victoria about paying for the first round of drinks. As the bill came around for that round, my boss gave her a small tip to which Victoria immediately looked at and questioned ""Is there a reason for this?"" She then asked if she was going to tip her more money.After my boss finished her drink, she left while some of us remained. Victoria comes back to us and asks if my boss left her anymore money. We awkwardly answer ""no"" and she scoffs and walks away. A minute later, she comes back to us to complain about the poor tip and how she will now have to tip the other staff out of pocket. At this point, my colleague speaks up and says that tipping is not mandatory (to which Victoria agrees) and suggests that the tip was that low because my boss did not like her service. Victoria responds by loudly saying ""now you're just making shit up"" and walks away. Meanwhile, I still have my own bill to pay. After sitting there for awhile, without Victoria returning, I had to go find someone to send me my bill. Never in my life have I ever experienced such terrible service. Her behaviour was rude and left us feeling uncomfortable. We will not be returning here ever again.",0
"Always a hassle at this KFC. Half the time they have no plastic knives. Some people like to eat chicken with a knife and fork. On the subject of forks, all the sporks at all KFC's are so thin they deform at any temperature over 90 degrees (see photo). The store was empty but the tables and floors were a mess (see photos). Their chicken was good on this trip, but not worth the hassles. Not a pleasant experience. I'll be back in 6 months....maybe.UPDATE 12/20/2017Stopped in for a pot pie. Congealed garbage with little chicken. KFC, close down your stores. No hope!!",0
"Absolutely horrible service tonight. We had to beg for plates, napkins, and I had to get up and asked for silverware. I brought it to the attention of the manager who could care less. Will never go back to this place again. Stuck in a corner like some dogs. Don't waste your time or your money.",0
"Great decor and drinks looked nice. But this is a restaurant, not a bar and I feel it should be reviewed as such. First off, there is no English menu, and when you ask the wait staff for one they will proclaim (triumphantly was it?) that they only have a French menu. I was not offered an apology or an explanation... It's montreal in the summer time, cater to your tourists a bit!The food was uninspired and incredibly over prices. $14 for a scant cup of cold diced steak and some shaved raw veggies? $22 for a hotdog?!? I don't care if it's 12 inches, it is just a hotdog!!Montreal needs more late night eating options but this just fails on so many levels",0
"I just received a bill from collections. I never once received an actual bill from Enticare. You can expect to never see a payment from me since you chose to mess with my credit. If you would have actually billed me, my bill would have been paid within 30 days. All Enticare offices offer a $5 gift card to Starbucks for completing a 5 star review. In other words, most 5 star reviews are fake. The NP I saw was fabulous, but I did not return because the office never and I mean NEVER answers their phone. Leave a message for a MA and they will never call you back. I've dealt with them as a patient and as a nurse attempting to get records for my patient. It's sickening that a specialist runs their office like this. It's one of those places that will gladly take your money and in return your healthcare means nothing to them. You are just a number and a paycheck. Don't expect any results or help from them.",0
It started good with their rusheta salad but when I had their spaghetti Bologna's I ate something that is weird like paper.  When the hostess looked she said it's a bay leaf and brought us back the remaining food. I don't think it's bay leaf because I know the taste of it. Overall experience at this restaurant is HORRIBLE. My first and last time eating at this place.,0
"So everything was going well as always and we are regulars there, until a large cockroach ran across our table fell on the floor and charged at me at which point I kicked it and it fell on its back and couldn't turn over. After that I put a napkin over it and stumped on it. We told the waitress to pick it up so no one else in the restaurant sees it and they never even apologized and brought us the full check. I did not leave a tip but paid the full amount. If they at least apologized we would of probably let it go but service is everything and this was a bad case of it.",0
"DO NOT GO HERE!!!! The owner is a crook. She sold my senior citizen father a broken part. When he tried to return it and get his money back, she accused him of breaking it himself while verbally abusing him and kicked him out of her store. I, his daughter, went to try to explain to this crook that my father had purchased a broken part and needed a refund. She started yelling, cursing, screaming, and verbally abusing me when I questioned her customer service. She then kicked me out of her store too. I cannot believe that there is a business like this. I'm only giving this place a one star by default, but they deserve no stars. They deserve to be shut down. This lady is abusive and a crook! All this over $18.91.",0

"No wait on Tuesday at noon but you'd think the waitress was slammed judging by her bad attitude from the moment we sat down.  She rushed us and was wrong about how my food was prepared (which was really annoying since i had to remove the toppings from my sandwich), and seemed annoyed that I was even asking her a question.  She was so off-putting that we weren't even comfortable asking her for refills on our drinks (not that she ever came by to ask how we were doing). The other servers were nice and the manager (owner?) came to ask how we were, fortunately.The food was OK.  I got a Loretta sandwich (had to remove the peppers since I don't like them raw, which is what I asked the waitress about). Tried the brioche french toast and that was good.  My fiancee wasn't too excited about the corned beef hash, which is sad because he loves it.  He said it tasted canned with some added onion.Overall, I'd never go back.  Much better options in the neighborhood.",0
"I actually really like this store but the employee/manager doesn't value his customers. I spent a lot of money at the store. I asked for a quad coil pack (set of 5) and was charged for a quad coil pack but when I got home and changed the coil I realised it was a triple coil. I called to ask about an exchange and was told that I could only exchange 4 of the 5 coils because I used one which I would have been completely fine with, except for the fact that I was then told I need to check what I buy before I leave. I found that rude and offensive as a customer. When I went back to exchange them I was then yelled at by the manager and he threw the coils that I originally paid for and wanted on the counter. I don't understand how a business can be run while disrespecting the people who pay your salary. I will definitely not ever go back there.",0
I am warning everyone. Olen Living is incredibly unprofessional and dangerous. The property manager Louis Duve brought a man with a gun to my move out walk through that her and I scheduled. He was not wearing a badge and wouldn't identify himself so I know he was not law enforcement. I had my girlfriend and my 8 year old son with me at the time and I had to rush him to my neighbor's apartment next door to keep him safe as I did not know why a man carrying a gun was there. I can not believe that happened toy family and I pray it doesn't happen to anyone else anymore. Be careful if you decide to move in and be cautious moving out.,0

"I am very unhappy about the service attitude.  I feel stigmatized.  We are eating, the staff keeps looking and are afraid that we will not pay.  we just finished eating, let go of the chopsticks, the staff brought the bill while I didn't call for payment.  I felt they discriminated against us. When we went to the shop, it was very polite, but everyone showed me that attitude.  will never come back",0
"There's nothing worse than being hungry and having hungry kids to arrive at your choice and being told that they are closed though the website says they close at 10:30 the sign on the door says they close at 10pm and the people inside obviously ready to go home says they close at 9:30. But you can pay full price eat whatever is left while you stand because they have already put all the chairs on the table and covered the salad bar with plastic wrap. They said it's a corporate policy, however I called all the other locations in Las Vegas and they said the dinning room closes at the posted time and about 15 minutes prior to that time the stop preparing pizza.",0
"My father in-law took my boys here a month ago, the costumer service was awful. A young lady who cut my oldest son's hair completely butchered it. When she asked him if he liked it, he said it ""liked okay"" and she replied ""at least it's not my hair!"" - my son is 10 years old... who says that to a kid? Then when they went to pay she gave my 8year old a sucker and not my 10 year old. Luckily I wasn't there because I would have raised hell.",0
"I am a big strip club fan, and was entirely unimpressed.  First, no one approached me for about half an hour.  When I was approached by a woman, and agreed to a dance, she then at the last minute decided to take along another girl and simply said  ""2 girl dance"" to the cashier.  I agreed, but this was a hard sales tactic.  The prices were then confusing and bizarre; they charge separately for the room, mandatory drinks, and dancers.  Then, my least favorite part.  There was some kind of nonsense going on with credit cards.  They came in and told me my card went through for less than the correct amount (which I figured didn't happen and they just made a mistake entering it - turns out it 'went through' for exactly the price of a 1 girl dance.)  So I needed a second card to pay the remaining amount.  Then there's this whole process around signing the receipts, including a bouncer sitting down next to you while you're getting a dance.  Then, they kept pestering me to do a longer dance.  I declined, and they pestered me for a tip.  Since that's tradition, I tipped out the dancers and cashiers.  Then more nonsense ensued - as I walked out of the building, I was told I needed to come back to the VIP room.  I walked in to find the waitress and the dancers yelling at each other and the dancers claiming they were underpaid, while the Israeli bouncer yelled at both of them.  We finally determined that, yes, I had paid less than we negotiated for.  Whose fault is that?  Anyway, they then kept me waiting for half an hour (one of the reasons I was leaving was that I felt a migraine coming on) to 'resolve this.'  Finally, they gave me a bill for more than they had said.  It was only a little more so I signed just to get out of there.  Now I'm wondering what will actually show up on my bill.Oh yea, and they keep your ID and credit card.  Nice.  They also expect tips for things like opening car doors.",0

"Oh hell...we won't be going back! lol After having an amazing dinner at San Tan Brewery where we sat outside and enjoyed our night we decided to splurge and have dessert somewhere else for some added fun to our evening. So we thought, ""Hey let's try The Melting Pot."" I had been a few years prior and thought it was completely over priced and not at all worth what you pay but my hubby had never been so I wanted him to have that fondue experience.We got there about 40 minutes before they closed and they immediately sat us in this claustrophobic little booth...thing. The last time I had been there I was with a party and we sat in a regular dining area. Yes this little booth was intimate but it really doesn't do them any favors. By having such little space and a closed curtain you start analyzing everything around your small area. Like how there was food splattered and stuck to the wall. Or how the wood along the wall had been essentially burned away over time from the heat coming off the fondue pots. Or how there was a HUGE uneven crack in the middle of our table. Everything just seemed outdated and grimy. After a few minutes our server came and asked for the drink orders. My hubby ordered an Irish coffee and I just wanted water. He asked me if I wanted one of the two sparkling waters they carried or ""tap water"". I told him tap water was fine and when he made a face I asked, ""Well is it filtered water?"" after he said yes I kind of just stared at him with a face like, ""okay and your issue is...?"" He just walked away. lol I'm sorry but I'm not going to pay your outrageous price for water, it's ridiculous, plus I'm not a fan of sparkling water. I'm perfectly fine with filtered water and this guy was trying to make it out as if I just ordered some unfiltered swamp water or something. Seriously, get over yourself. So I got my undesirable ""tap water"" and my hubby got his coffee. The yin-yang chocolate was brought out with the dippers and we were pretty disappointed. The cheesecake looked and tasted exactly like Wal-Mart's cheesecake, the brownies were so sugary sweet I could barely get my one piece down, the marshmallows were stale, and the bananas had brown spots on them! Although, the pound cake (I believe it was), the strawberries and the rice crispy treats were okay but it was an extremely small portion and way over priced, just like it was a few years ago. After we were finishing up my hubby still needed to finish his coffee and the server brought out the check...and then started clanking glasses, vacuuming, loudly shouting to others, laughing, and talking about inapproprate coworker drama. The place went from quiet to very noisy in a matter of a couple minutes. Apparently waiting to clean the restaurant until all the guests have left isn't something they train the staff on. It was extremely rude.All in all I'm glad we went ONLY so that my hubby could have that experience, which he didn't like, so we won't be back. Don't waste your money when you can easily buy some good quality chocolate, melt it at home, and enjoy it with fresh fruits and other dipping pieces of your choice.",0
"too bad you that i should put at least 1 star. as go right now...i am waiting for my car for 1.5 hours, called back few minutes ago to cancel but the lady hanged up on me. SOOOOO if you are in a hurry and don't have few hours to wait DO NOT USE THEM!!!!!!!!!!THE WORST SERVICE POSSIBLE!!!!!",0
"Poor customer service and massages. I have requested a deep massage twice at this location and was disappointed both times. When this was brought to the attention of front desk staff and management, neither seemed to care. Go to Surprise location if you want a great experience. Rhonda is a great therapist at that location.",0
"The blandest sandwich I've ever eaten. The almond tuna sandwich was 99% tasteless sprouts and 1% tuna. Had to keep pulling the unnecessary amount of sprouts out so I could actually taste the sandwich. Even then, still wasn't good. Bread itself was okay I guess, but couldn't even appreciate it when the sandwich as a whole was disgusting. I truly don't understand the unnecessary hype about this place.",0
"Showed up early for our romantic anniversary dinner reservation on October 9th, expecting to have a cocktail to find the bar was packed. That's fine, we went next door to Hecho. Upon our return, we were seated at a tiny table for two, in the packed bar! When asked, ""Is there something more private for us? This is rather uncomfortable,"" the host responded with, ""Well, since you made your reservation today, this is what we have for you."" Ok, that's fine, we'll relax and make the best of it. A server quickly came by, asking for our order yet, we hadn't  opened the wine list nor reviewed the menu yet. After deciding what we'd like to order, about 10mins later, we waited patiently for our server who never showed after another 15mins so we left. We walked over to L'Atelier thinking we had no chance of getting a seat yet alas, we were seated and had another FABULOUS evening! Thank You and we'll be back to support the Joel Robuchon again in a heartbeat. Sorry Tom Colicchio. Cheers!",0
As much as I like to support some of the smaller businesses in my community I have to say this is one of the worst businesses as far as customer service is concerned. I would recommend customers take their business elsewhere -go to someplace like REI wheee they actually value the customer. Here is my story: went into the shop and purchased a fairly expensive pair of ski pants $340. Drove with my family to Flagstaff and when I put the pants on the next morning I noticed that there were some loose strings hanging from the side seam. I photographed the hanging strings .I Carefully saved the receipt and the bag and the tag and used the pants for several hours of skiing. When I returned to Phoenix I attempted to have the pants exchanged for a non defective pair because by this time the stitching was coming out quite significantly along the seam after only a few hours of use. I Explained that I wanted to exchange them so that I could enjoy the remainder of the ski season. The manager told me quite unsympathetically NO the store would not be financially out for the cost of the pants so they would have to be returned to the manufacturer and the manufacturer would have to attempt to repair the defective pair of pants. Manager would not even offered to give me a pair of ski rental pants to use until these were  repaired as he explained it to me the store would lose money !!!! He assured me  that I would be called and notified when they would be ready by the weekend so I could go skiing agin. No return call to me was ever made I made follow-up calls and had to leave a message for a manager and never received a follow-up telephone call back.  I have since purchased another pair of ski pants from REI where I  know that if there is any problem with them they would happily exchange them or give me a refund or store credit. it has now been several weeks and I still have not heard back from ski pro. Unbelievably this business sold me a $340 pair of ski pants which were defective and refused to do the right thing and forced me to go out elsewhere to another business to purchase another pair of ski pants so that I can enjoy the remainder of the ski season. The business does not even have the courtesy to call their customer back . I will certainly not bring my business to this place again.and I will advise everyone to avoid this place. I will also be sharing my experience online on social media etc.,0
"Just had to get up and walk out of this place so as far as food goes I couldn't tell you, we did not even get a chance to eat! We asked for a patio table. Got sat slowly greeted by our server, her name is Sedona!She got our drinks sat them down but the table was wobbling so one of our drinks spilled and was running off the table. Sedona said let me get something so your table doesn't wobble and leaves to go clean the table behind us. She then goes to the back and comes back with another tables food. Finally she comes back and asks to take our order water still running off the table and nothing to stop the table from wobbling. So I said and I quote *Well are you going to wipe off the table first* her reply was and i quote * you dont have to be so rude* so we got up spoke to the manager and left! So if you would like extremely poor customer service please sit with Sedona!",0
Thus place is crazy.  People signed in over an hour ago and have still not been called up for insurance check.  Appointments are booked up for next 3 weeks.  Hire more staff you have the clients.,0
"WTFHIGH PRESSURE sales for the most vulnerable, insecure people = $$$ in their pocket. DON'T fall for their high pressure tactics. No, the prices won't go up if you don't sign now!!! No, your consultant's next client is not waiting!!!! Do yourself a favor and love your body, your true body, rather than give them your hard earned cash! $8500 for a back! C'mon! They get commission for sales people!!!!  You're  insecure and they have a ""cure"" and you WILL PAY! No deal!",0
I saw the trucks on the road and called to fix my garage heater The man that came out after les then 1 min asked me where the breakers and started flipping switches without reading what it was for thow it was in big print in red and black stating how to start the generator. He blew something the house went dark. he did not know what to do and did not know how to get out of my house fast enough. left me in the dark I  called the office it got worse. I never got a call back Putting  salt on the wound they sent me a bill !  wowwell my exeperince was not good good luck on your visit from this not so good company,0
"This was a passable hotel for my visit 2 years ago, so I went back.  Now they are charging for parking.  They even charge the guests staying at the hotel.  I will not be returning.  There are simply better places to stay that don't nickel and dime you to death.",0
Great job. Haha. We wait for you to open then you take others that come in after because they have been here before.  Guess you just wait on friends? What a joke don't go to this place. So sad that a medical facility treats people like this. Perhaps you take care of people in order.So after she calls in 6 people after us tells us she forgot. Really forgot. Then calls in person after us agAin says she will get to her soon. Wow what a terribly run place. Hope you don't come here and need help.,0
"Visited this restaurant with high hopes. Being Greek myself, I expected something delectable. Discovery:1.) Walked in and no one greeted. It was busy, so did a self-seat. 10 minutes at the table, and no attendance from any staff. Finally had to go get someone... only after noticing the girls standing around talking. 2.) The waitress took the order. A standard gyro with lamb, cucumber and classic tzatziki sauce, and a Greek salad and a coke. Time until food arrived was good. 3.) The food: The lamb was over cooked, chewy, dry and over-grilled so the burnt taste really came through. Cucumber was chopped so finely, it lost its flavor. But the greatest disappointment was the tzatziki sauce. Watery and absolutely NO flavor.The watery sauce inevitably turned the bread to mush. As a final kicker, even the Coke was flavorless, nothing more than soda water with a smidgen of syrup and a load of ice (ordered the Coke for the Coke, not the ice). The only saving grace was the salad. However, it too had the flavorless cucumber.SUMMARY:The place turned out a real disappointment. It's not much more than a typical bar/meet for happy hour kind of place. Hugely noisey, and fast food-dressed up as Mediterranean. Pricing: $$ / Reasonable.Rating Scale is: Noms, Good, Meh, Bit Sick, Sick = Final rating: Meh to Bit SickYelp rating: 1",0
Poor service and out of products. The donut I did get was stale. This is my second bad experience here so I thought I would warn the masses.,0
"I was on a family vacation and I chose this salon to give my 12 year old son a hair cut... BIG MISTAKE!! When we arrived we werent greeted nicely by Jeanine and we were told to wait (we ended up waiting 15 min and there were no other customers there) we felt unwelcome but still proceeded to get the haircut since my son really needed one. The stylist, Jeanine took my son and if she didn't know how to give a proper hair cut, she should of not have done it at all! We had asked for a middle fade and to just trim the top!  Tell me why, she practically shaved almost all of his hair and just Cutts the top. I also made the mistake of going to the restroom during the time of his haircut and came back to a nightmare. I just couldn't believe what she had done to my sons hair. I was courteous but I made it clear that I was very dissatisfied with it. She still charge us for the haircut and didn't even ask if we wanted a shampoo but still did it and still charged us for it! I wanted to cry, I was so upset. And my son broke down in tears because he was so embarrassed! I had to buy him a hat to wear to cover the messed up hair cut and he wore it the whole time of our trip! This review was overdue but ever time I take him to the barber here at home, I'm reminded by this incident because we are still trying to fix her mistake!",0
"Today was the first time I visited this location. I usually go to the location in Ballantyne. But this was one of the worst and most disgusting restaurants I've ever been in. First of all when you walk in it smells awful and the floor is clearly not kept up with there was dirt everywhere. My family and I ordered our drinks and food and just tried to enjoy ourselves. After getting our bowls to fill at the bar I went over to the meat bar first. At first glance everything looked fine. But when I stuck serving tongs in the steak bin the steak was all frozen in a big block. Next, the shrimp had an odd smell and color on it. We did not even get past the meat bar before leaving the restaurant. I will not visit this location again. I told my waiter about the steak and he did not really seem to care. We will not be back.",0
"New to the Gilbert area so I decided to try this salon out. Me and my friend walked in and instantly had a bad feeling because the lady was SO rude right off the bat. I received a gel pedicure and regular manicure and it took 3 people to do the job.. Sat in the chair for a good two hours while the staff ran around like chickens with their heads cut off, starting one customer then starting someone else, etc. She used the light to dry my nails multiple times because she couldn't even remember where she left off.. While waiting for them to finish, another customer was complaining because she made an appointment for a full set and was waiting 40 minutes because the staff forgot about her.. they also took the plastic lining off of my chair and put it directly onto someone elses chair with no cleaning what so ever.. while the lady was finishing up my nails, I kid you not, took the cuticle cutter and cut her own nail right in front of us without cleaning it first.. disgusting! Not only horrible customer service but a disgusting ""nail salon."" I will NEVER go back!!! RUN FAR AWAY!! And I paid 55 dollars for a ""regular"" gel pedicure and a ""regular"" manicure with clear polish none the less. Waste of money and time! I ran home and soaked my feet in antibacterial soap because this place is so nasty!",0
"Filed a complaint to the The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. we paid the cleaning fee and they knew that I have a service dog that was bigger than their weight limit and they called us back a little after signing things and paying the cleaning fee saying ""never mind we have to reject you, the dog is too big"" I tried explaining that you can't refuse a service dog by she wouldn't listen, she gave us back double what we paid for the cleaning fee. Illegal to refuse service dogs. I wouldn't even rate 1 star if I didn't have to",0
"I wouldn't even give any stars. The building is extremely old which means u can hear loud squeaks every time the upstairs neighbor moves. I'm not talking about small squeaking noise instead it's like the sharp noise of ur nails against a chalkboard kind of squeak. It's super annoying and there is nothing u can do about it. There r so many roaches no matter how clean u are and the staff is not at all helpful. Worst living experience ever. And the rent is expensive if u consider the condition of the house and the services. With the same price u can literally live anywhere in vegas with a much better environment. Run, people!",0
"THE most horrible service I have ever encountered. And this isn't a solitary experience. It is every time I  have been there. You ask ""Why do you keep going back?"" Well, I have no choice. My pool league is out of this establishment every Wednesday night. Last night I was there and our team played in the basement. When I arrived, there were probably about 20 people or more in this area. You would think this would warrant a server. Right? Wrong. So I walked up the 3 flights of stairs to go and get a beverage (Captain and Diet) After being ignored for a few minutes, she finally comes over and fills my order. I walk back down said 3 flights of stairs to find that she has made it with regular. Honest mistake. So, I walk back up said 3 flights of stairs to have her fix it. She does (but not without a ""I thought I did make it with diet"" Really? Would I walk up 3 flights of stairs if it was correct???) I brush it off. I go back downstairs thinking that, surely, I could order food from the girl folding napkins behind the bar. (that is closed) I ask her if I can order food. I get a glazed over confused look in return and am replied with ""I don't know"" followed with you will have to go upstairs and order from the bar. So I walk back up the 3 flights of stairs and go to the bar. Again, bartender pretends to not see me. Finally she comes over and takes my order. Then she proceeds to ask me if I can come back up in 25 minutes to get my order. Seriously? I just saw a runner,with food,not two minutes ago, that you were telling where to go with the order. I promptly cancelled my order. Jupiters II, you need to step up your game.",0
"I ordered the ""Invincible"", a vegan dish comprised of vegan meatballs, sweet potato and kelp noodles, ricotta and pasta sauce. The meatballs were dry, the noodles tasted like bean sprouts and the pasta sauce was worse than something you get out of a tin can. Absolutely gross. From the looks of the place, I suspect the other dishes might be better than 1 star but for what I ordered, this place deserves a 0 star.",0
They installed my bed platform and one of the legs isn't even on it. Makes it a pain to ever move my bed.Update: Bed broke and they wouldn't even come out to fix it without paying almost $100,0
"After three years of shopping here, I'm done.  They implemented a store redesign that's so perversely illogical that customers find a new camaraderie in helping each other find where products are, because they're not where any thinking person would have put them.  It's like a giant game of ""Concentration"" where you have to try to remember where you might have seen what it is you're looking for now, when you were wandering the aisles looking for something else earlier.  Utterly ridiculous, thoroughly infuriating, and a complete waste of my time.  I'm done.  Albertson's is only a mile away.",0
"I taked to Danny he said he was the owner and that he would buy my 3 appliances, stove , freidge and dishwasher for $200.00.  On the day of pick up they were 7 hours late.  The drivers showed up with  NO money.  They took my appliances and was promised they would have my $200.00 in an envelope at 8 am.  I received a call from one of the girls Becky I believe her name was and she was very rude and said she was delivering my appliance that day or I could donate them to her!! what are you kidding me, from giving me $200.00 to donate!!!! SCAMMERS!!! I dont fall for stupid!!  The fride had 2 huge dents don the front, dishwasher is only 1 1/2 years old and she complained about a little touch up paint on the front. The driver had told me to make sure I call first thing in the morning becasue they have been known not to do what they say!!!  BUYER BEWARE THESE PEOPLE ARE SCAM ARTIST!!! They dont even deserve a 1 rating wish there was a zero! Customer Service is very bad, and they are very rude people. I will be glad to donate to someone who will apprciate them!!!!",0
We were scheduled for a sand tournament today. We got 2 hotel rooms and brought our whole family. We just arrived to carolina courts and there is no one here so we checked the website to make sure we were in the right location. The website says cancelled due to weather. We were never contacted to say the tournament was cancelled! The weather says there is a 30% chance of rain at 3:00. I'm sorry but this is not a reason to cancel the tournament. We were supposed to start at 8:00 this morning. We even practice in the rain! Why were we not contacted??,0
"This was the worst Chinese food I ever ate in cleveland. I love Chinese food,  I went there Tuesday evening. I ordered a shrimp egg foo young combination with chicken fried rice and (4) wings. After waiting 20 minutes for my order which was no problem because I love my food hot and fresh.They forgot to put my wings in the bag so I had to turn around and go back. The lady at the counter threw in an extra wing for my troubles. Ok cool.I get home open my food take a bit of my egg foo young it taste burnt and it taste like it was dipped in some fish oil giving it a Medicine taste of Father Johns cold medicine, and the rice was hard. The wings were hard and old looking when I broke the wing open the meat was brown.  They tasted like old dirty grease. I drove from Shaker Hts to Turney Road plaza for this garbage food. Never again in life will I eat there and I'll discourage anyone I know from eating there including my Dog!",0

"Do not trust this company. Rogers Outrank sells very hard, they try to sign you up right away before you can think twice. If you do sign up with them, be prepared for some leads, that trail off, the account rep gives all sort of excuses. This is another ripoff service from a company with a  nickname of Robbers. Buyer Beware! Look into other SEO services that care about small business. For my business this was a waste of money.",0
"Highly disappointed in my pizza today.  Travel all the way from Amherst /Vermilion area to pick up burnt pizza!!  I called them and all they could do is give me $6 off on the next pizza.

"CenturyLink needs to get out of the cable business and just provide PHONE service.  Was a crap shoot when we turned the TV on if we would have cable or a blank screen. Every time we called it was a box issue.  Finally after MONTHS I was done.  Customer service told me to return equipment back to the store on Rainbow.  Two weeks later I take it Saturday to the store on Rainbow and first person sitting behind the counter feeding her face tells me: We no take equipment here.  I tell her I was told to deliver it here and when did this rule happen and she said three months ago and I told her less than two weeks ago I was told to return it to that store.  Didn't get her name but she had a mouth full of food and did not speak English well. So I called the store this morning to complain to the manager and Jonna answered, and I am sure she is the same rude bitch that I talked to Saturday, and said the manager was on a conference call.  Told her I would wait and proceeded to tell her what happened Saturday.  She was very rude AGAIN telling me I needed to have it sent in.  I told her I still wanted to talk to a manager and she put me on hold and Whoops.... just like that I got a dial tone.  Ignorant bitch.",0
"The buffet was horrible. The only, and I mean only, positive part of this Buffet is the endless mimosas. The food was so bland and low caliber. The desserts were not liked by me or anyone at my table (there were 7 of us). Not one of us enjoyed the food.",0
Worse customer service! Mana took out order and forgot about it. Another associate came and was like look you forgot the drinks and they laughed. I asked for my receipt and Mana said she couldn't give it to me. Then when I asked her to mix the drink I order she said she couldn't do it. I will never come back to this Starbucks! Very unprofessional,0
"I wanted to like it here. I was planning on making it my go to place for laundry. However, I fear something is faulty in their prepay system. I added twenty dollars to my card, did one large machine, which is about three dollars, and about four dry's at thirty nine cents each. When I came in the following week, my balance was six dollars. I filed complaint, but haven't heard back yet. So, I won't be returning. It's better to use coins, easier to monitor use and less likely to loose your money.",0
"50min to check-in. Elderly ladies in front of us were failing was insane! I've stayed in nearly every  hotel on the strip and never had such bad customer service, I actually called from the line to the hotel to inform them how bad it and was told it's always like this at 4pm as its check in time, which wasn't reassuring surely if you know it's going to be busy you put more than three  front desk staff on especially if one of them is dealing with people who were just picking up keys!!! No cocktail waitress in the casino, no waitresses at the pool you have to line up at a fast food kiosk for drinks,and to top it off my sister has a line up from her feet to her ankle of bites from bed bugs!!!!",0
Came here for a family christmas trip and was very disappointed.  Breakfast was ok (nothing I didn't expect) but the room was not up to par.

"Stop scheduling senior citizens during rush hour in the morning and just after 5pm.Super slow, mostly cannot comprehend simple orders. I go to this location extremely often as it is en route to the office. Sometimes I wish I have never worked in the hospitality industry, because I might be more sympathetic being ignorant.Why are you so slow at this location? If you are lucky enough to get a young attentive buck to take your coffee order, consider yourself lucky and buy a lotto ticket. This location is terrible. Only go here, if you are truly desperate for a coffee. Not even worth one star. Seriously, get it together.",0

The front office doesn't respond to emails, phone calls or maintenance requests.  Good luck getting anything fixed.  Worst management ever!   But...they will put you on a list?!?!  A list for what?  They knew before the students moved in that the internet wasn't working.  Do you think they planned ahead and fixed it? NO!!!Rent from someone else!  ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!",0
"Confronted manager about how bad the salsa was he says they don't put jalapeño or onion in.  I checked Websters.  Salsa is defined as a spicy tomato sauce with onion and hot peppers.  So essentially it is tomato sauce with oregano.  He also said they are an american chain and not a Mexican restaurant.  They need to change the sign I think.  Food including seafood was either old and dry or undercoooked.  ""White queso"" was orange like Velveeta.  Service so bad had to get another server to get the manager.  Had to eat chili with out a spoon. Music playing was nice classic rock which we liked.  Apparently can't rate zero stars so had to give them one",0

We went back a week later . No host in the front  . Couldn't wait any longer ,talked to the server and  told us he'll get  someone.

"Walked past this place the other day looking for a quick bite to eat that was nothing fancy.  The place was nearly empty on a Friday afternoon around lunch time.  There was really no theme from a decor perspective other than an under funded diner in the ""middle of no-where"" in the middle of America struggling to make ends meet.  Bare walls with no even any art up and the back wall had some exposed electrical wiring.  Well, this is not in the ""middle of no-where"" but rather the middle of Scottsdale and I expected a bit more.  Nevertheless, I decided to give it a true.The server was very attentive and kind.  I asked her what was good here and the suggestion was the Davids Burgers and anything Mexican on the menu.  I choose the David's Burger, thinking the signature item with the owners name on it would be at least good.  I was wrong, the burger bland, too much lettuce and onions and there was a thick slice of cheese the was dry and completely clashed with the rest of the burger.  Furthermore, the bun was not even warm.  Come'on guys at least put the bun on the grill and warm it up a bit.  As much as I tried to fairly have this place a second star, I just could not.",0
"Got to be honest, this place reeks of a corp guy tired of the grind, thinks opening a bar is a great idea.  With NO idea what do to, menu's look as if they laminated at home, beer list is photo copies, menu is horrible, food even worse, I don't think they have a cook, certainly not a chef that developed the menu!  The waitress was great, this is a sport bar?  The music was so depressing, could even begin to watch the game, I made up an excuse to leave not to offend my waitress.  My last choice ever, ever and let's see EVER!  Would never go back, such a horrible vibe inside!  Even the chairs weren't sized correctly to the table, so uncomfortable.  Sorry guys - go back to corp world...this place will never make it.",0

"Would definitely not recommend them. I called and they said they would send someone out. They showed up at about 9pm which was fine. By that time the house had cooled. He looked and said I needs a good cleaning. Took his gauges out back to the unit opened the cover, but never hooded them up. He then spend a lot more time trying to sell me $3200 work of cleaning coils, as well as unnecessary other essentials. He collected his service fee and left. No work done, nothing accomplished. I went on the website and voiced my concern never heard a word from them. They answer the phone how can we put a smile on their face. Well, its how to put a smile on their face by charging for nothing and not doing any work. Sad to say the unethical practice of some companies is unfortunate. There use to be customer service, not from them. It how do they charge for doing nothing. I recommend you seek out other professionals for all your air conditioner needs.",0
"It's amazing to me that a place is in business. I went in there one time and it was just okay. The second time I walked in wasn't greeted. I took a seat with other people and waited. The barbers one by one finished cutting peoples hair and just decided to take a break. One started eating, 2 walked out the door and 2 more just sat there talking. You'd think a business would want customers?! No big deal, theres plenty of barber shops in the area. Never again will I go here.",0
I would 0 stars if I could. Craig is a racist asshole who doesn't need to be in a business AT ALL,0
Will never use them againCalled week prior confirming appointment get there on scheduled day and time per the also follow up email to be told I had no appointment and that I could leave my car 8am and be told by the very rude lady at desk to come back by 6pm and maybe will be ready really horrible service,0
"Would absolutely not recommend. Everytime I go in to simply drop a package off that has a mailing label and is tapped up, I'm in line for at least 15 minutes. To top it off, staff is always rude.  Lesson finally learned, I won't give them another chance. Oh, by the way, the FedEx down the street is always quick & great customer service",0
"Don't bother showing up here unless you have spare time on your hands to take your chances. After reading so many nice reviews on here I thought I would give this place a shot. I called ahead to see if they had room to fix 2 nails. Sure - come at 7:30 they said and don't be late. I came at 7:31 - the girl at the front had no idea what I was talking about and couldn't understand me. The other girl told me everyone had left. Apparently I was late and they don't accept late appointments. I'm sorry - its my bad, but in the 60 seconds extra it took me to get there everyone left? That is completely ridiculous. Also - as we all know it takes little to no time at all to fix TWO nails. The employees couldn't even be bothered to call me and tell me everyone was leaving? Such a waste of time considering I left work specifically to come to this place. Terrible customer service experience.",0
They dont open on time. And the guy was rude. We came in 4 mins past 11 and the man didnt even let us sit down. Just promptly told us they arnt open. If your not open why is the door unlocked? Why does it say open at 11 when no one is ready? How come you didnt let us take a seat and wait?Disappointing.,0
"This review was also posted to their Facebook page. Putting one star so people can see there are still hour long wait times for breakfast. My three children and I had brunch here yesterday to celebrate Mother's Day early and try to skip the crazy restaurant crowds Vegas usually has on holidays. We were seated at 11:30, ordered our food at 11:35 and we were served at 12:31!!! Thank goodness my three children are extremely well behaved, even though my two year old was understandably getting anxious. While we were sitting there quietly and obviously upset with three frowning, hungry children, nobody approached us to apologize for the wait until 47 minutes of waiting (by this point I started checking my watch). At 51 minutes, the manager came by to apologize for the wait as well because they were ""really busy"". There were eight tables total in my area and only 2/8 of those tables were served their food. The table next to me that finally got their food were waiting as long as we were. There was another customer who made a big stink about the wait and got up to leave a couple of times but his wife stayed behind so he and his son eventually came back and were finally served their food. The manager spoke to him apologizing a few times and then I hear that customer got a 20% discount to ""make up for the wait"" but myself nor the other customers sitting next to me got that same discount. Because we were being polite and waiting patiently? That's really unfair. I would never ask for a discount for a long wait time but to not be offered one because I didn't make a big scene about it isn't fair at all. The Kailua location was one of our family's favorite places to go when we were living in Hawaii. After seeing the mixed reviews when this place first opened, I held off on visiting for a few months to give them time to work out their kinks but a 50+ minute wait for breakfast food is unacceptable. I just saw other reviews from over three months ago complaining about the same thing and it's an issue that still isn't fixed yet. Go to Baby Stacks if you want great food and quick service. They constantly have lines out the door but you will never wait more than 20 minutes for your food.",0
"This restaurant has wonderful food, however anyone who decides to eat here needs to factor in very bad service to the experience. Do not go to this restaurant if you are hungry or have some place to be. Average wait time inside the restaurant is hour and a half, average wait time if you call ahead to pick up is 40 min. longer than told on the phone. Everyone understands the need to wait for good food, however it is unacceptable to be told your food is ready and then forgotten because of horrific communication skills held by the employees.",0
"The worssssssst customer service i have ever seen!!! One of the teller was extremely unprofessional. What a shame for bank of America to have employees like that. Besides that, they are low on employees even though they are extremely busy. Not a welcoming branch what so ever! Never going there!",0
"and just when you think it couldn't get any worse. I went to pick up some take out drinks and to my horror the guy working behind the counter drops a whole jug of mango juice on the floor and proceeds to mop it, nothing to crazy right? but then he starts to wring out the mop in what seems to be the only working sink in the establishment. Mind you this wasn't a brand new mop it was so grey and dingy I could imagine what it smelled like. Won't be going back anytime soon.",0
"They open at 10. I showed up at 10:30 and they still had nothing ready. I literally waited 30 minutes (because my gf wanted panda) for string bean chicken and mushroom chicken. It was ridiculous... A couple showed up after I arrived they ordered, ate and left and I was still waiting. Will not be back to this location because of the bad service. By he time I got home the rest of my food was cold and veggie rolls were soggy. I would give this 0 stars if I could",0
"They flipped the blizzard upside down and big chunks fell out. I was so embarrassed for them I didn't ask for it to be topped off I just took it and walked away.I felt like it was not just my ice cream that hit the floor, but all the hopes and dreams of the Dairy Queen employee who had failed to properly prepare my peanut butter, cookie dough, Jurassic World movie tie in special edition Blizzard.The service here is always bad, but you know what??? I keep going anyway. I go because deep down I know I don't deserve good service, I don't deserve a cold blizzard that is clean on the sides and I don't want one.But maybe if I keep going.... Someday the service will get better... And maybe.., just maybe... On that day I will deserve it.",0
"Buyer beware. If you want to get ripped off go to Ride-now Chandler. If your looking for a Polaris, call Four Seasons Motorsports in Payson "" 928 474 3411"". Its well worth the drive. The non negotiated price was $2800 difference on a $12,000 machine. The sales guys are great but the sales managers doing the pricing will try to rip you off, like you don't know whats going on.",0
Horrible service.  From out of town and wanted a good bar to watch the football games.  Sat at bar for 10min and waited for bartender to acknowledge and he walked by 10 times and avoided eye contact.  As a bartender myself you have to greet a guest within 15sec of them sitting down.  Don't normally write reviews unless they're good but felt that this place needs to know that their bald bartender with a beard is horrible at his job and only takes care of his regulars.  My managers would fire me immediately if I ever got a review like this.,0
"This company is a fraud.  We took time out of our schedule to listen to their presentation!  They made it so believable.  They have some incompetent, unprofessional people working for them!  You do not have to be educated to provide excellent customer service.  They have no problem taking your money, but they can't assist you in operating their site why because it doesn't WORK!   THESE PEOPLE ARE FRAUD!!!! HANG UP ON THEM DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LISTEN AFTER HELLO MY NAME IS JUST HANG UP!  They pass the buck off to the next!  Their representatives don't even know their product!!! JUST A RIPOFF!!!! Bought plan in January it's August still unable to utilize services!  Will never be swindled again! FIORE YOU SUCK!!!!!",0
"I was referred to Dr Alan Hamilton today.l, as my long term PCP was unavailable. lthough my medical records are accessible to any Honor Health physician, my records and medical history were of zero interest at my exam today. I have a well documented history of cold symptoms turning into long term respiratory illnesses, including last year. I communicated my concern regarding my headaches, chills, runny congested nose and cough developing into respiratory. Dr Hamilton could care less. He examined me for 60 seconds and yet never looked inside my nostrils. I was sent off with a suggestion to ""eat chicken noodle soup, buy Tylenol and robitussin if I need it."" Ugh!!!! I called the Mayo Clinic to set up my annual physical later this year. We all deserve quality healthcare...",0
Worst place ever. Wouldn't let us out of the place without upselling everything they could. Avoid at all cost.,0
Yikes...been here a few times and every time it just gets worse . Now I will not come back It's a shame cause it's close to home and a nice looking spot but when you watch your pho come out of a microwave ...its extremely disappointing.  The food mediocre ...the service lacked.  A check was bought to the table before I was even done . Never asked if I needed a drink or even dessert . Goodbye local place . I'm moving on.,0
"Had pizza here twice (I usually give everyone a second chance). Totally disappointed both times. The last time I ordered a pan pepperoni for me & the mrs. Was told it would be ready in half an hour... I showed up, and they were just starting to make it. Waited another 45 minutes, was ""done"", so I took it home, the outer crust was done, the center 2/3rds was RAW dough. Threw it in the garbage... Wont be back...sorry!",0
I arrived 10/15 mins before their closing time and their doors were still open. But when I walked in the girls that were working told me they were closed.So far as a first impression of this place. It has left a bad taste in my mouth.I am not sure if I would give this place another try.... I may update me review but as of right now. I am keeping it as a 1 based on first impressions.I did try to contact tru about this matter and their response was... They were out of stock by the end of the day and do not restock until the next morning.,0
"I'm really disappointed, and feel I was ripped off.  Chris Angle seemed bored, and towards the end of the show we learned why.  He lets the audience know that his child is suffering from childhood cancer, (we didn't know that, and I'm really sorry to hear that).  The show became an infomercial for childhood cancer with pictures. Then we were asked to donate money. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to be insensitive, and I hope the best for any child suffering. I just don't appreciate hearing about it with visuals when I paid over $150 for each of my 4 front row tickets.  I thought I was going to be entertained, not depressed.  We were celebrating our sons 21st Birthday.Also, don't pay for the expensive seats, there's no intensive.  He completely ignores the front rows and caters to the back. I hope the best for his son, and any child suffering on any level.",0
Don't go here. The fact that this bar/restaurant has such a bad rating isn't a surprise after going here. The blond hair woman manager was extremely rude and has zero customer service skills. Someone at our table didn't receive their meal until everyone else had finished eating. We wanted to speak with her to see if there was something she could do because of the terrible service. She offered nothing and began accusing someone at our table of yelling at her - which was absurd. I have never heard a manager speak to customers like that. I was appalled. The food was below average and I have nothing positive to say about this place except that the band they hired played good music. The city is full of amazing places but this is not one of them. Save your money.,0
Staying at this hotel is one of our worst experiences. There is a band playing so loud across the street that sleep is out of the question. We are on the19th floor and can here every note and understand every word. This is crazy.This is an invasion of the space and privacy that we paid for. We have to travel tomorrow and the front desk said this will go on till 3 or 4 in the morning.We will NOT be back here again.,0
"My mother-in-law and I came in for manicures and pedicures. We waited about 35 minutes. They say us with our feet in the water as if they were going to start right away. I then asked someone how long the wait would be and she ignored me. Once the service began, the pedicure was fine. The guy who did my nails started my manicure but was trying to cut my cuticles without them being moistened properly. I told him to stop, and he then applied cuticle cream. I always get gel manicures but I could already tell it probably would've been a poor polish job so I opted for regular polish. My polish is thick,bubbly and looks terrible. I also asked for the sandals that they give you once the pedicure is done and never received any. Neither did my mother in law. When we got to the front desk, the girl said they did have the shoes and apologized for us not receiving them.",0
"ordered the double cheese steak.  there may have been 3oz of charred grizzle in the sandwich which was greasy.  the chicken pizza with white sauce and tomatoes was a chopped breaded chicken patty.  The pizza was in editable.  called for delivery .25 miles away...took 1.5 hours.  when I called 45 minutes in, the lady said it was on the truck and hung up on me.  Avoid this train wreck.",0
All I gotta say is bye Felicia !!! Good riddance the closing sale was hilarious I saw a lot of people going crazy for 10% off that's not a sale that's regular price at Walmart. The closing sale is a joke don't waste your time here nothing's hardly left and the liquidation sale was a waste of time ...,0
"BEWARE! This is not a child friendly dentist, actually quite the opposite. My 3.5 year old is terrified of the dentist now. The technician just picked my child up (he was protesting) kicking and began to scream as she told me she was taking him for X-rays and walked away from me. 1. I did NOT give you permission to touch my child. 2. When I call to follow up on the situation you all have nothing to say. I AM DISGUSTED. Staff is straight up STUPID and can not understand plain English. Shame on your magic smiles. I will also be filing a formal report with the dental association, maybe even talking to my attorney. Please don't take your children here. It's not worth the terror that the staff will instill in them.",0
Horrible experience with emergency room doctor.  The dr tried to diagnose me before receiving answer if something was wrong.  I felt that what he did was cruel! I believe all tests should be done first!  I will never go back to this hospital!,0
"centurylink has the worst customer service and internet tech support,,i would recommend any other provider...",0
"Great service, really terrible food. Absolutely no taste and very bland, for apps and entrees.  Extremely overrated.  If you're looking for good Italian food in Vegas, this is definitely not it.  Do yourself a favor and go off the strip for it.  I'm not sure how such a high profile chef could serve food like this.",0
"We've sat in the car on the street for 15 minutes already waiting for valet to park the car. There is no self park option. Front desk says, ""we have two weddings going on and everyone available is parking cars. It's unfortunate."" Yes, so unfortunate that we will not stay here again. And now the restaurant service is pathetic. Waiting 45 minutes for our meal.",0
"I'm not sure where to begin, looking back on our experience seems like a bad dream.  After waiting for drinks for so long we forgot if we'd ordered them or not, finally being asked an hour later if we'd like to order food, the final straw was being told my filet had ""missed"" the plate in the kitchen and fell on the floor.  The owner needs to be in on the hiring of staff from the managers to the waiters.",0
Worst airline ever! Hour delayed flight and its been 20 mins and no one is at the gate to let us off.  Never again!,0
"I don't even know where to begin. When I first started coming here, the food flavor and portions was awesome, the service was amazing and the atmosphere was incredible. But now the only thing that remained the same was the damn service from the staff. The food portions keep getting smaller and smaller and it's probably because of the new owner. I don't know if you know how Hawaiian people work, but if we go somewhere to eat, and we don't get full, we don't go back. That was a half portion. To say the most. (I got Kalua pig) it was $9 and it was smaller than half the plate! And that was INCLUDING THE RICE! I don't know what you guys are gonna changed but you need to change it back! ASAP!",0
The inside of this place smells terrible and the food is mediocre. Throw in the lacklustre service and you've got a solid 1 star eatery.,0
"Where do I begin? I stopped by San Tan Ford last Sunday to test drive a Ford Explorer and was immediately greeted by a salesman who lost interest as soon as I mentioned I wanted to lease a vehicle. Shortly after I was approached by a salesman named Dale and we test drove an Explorer Limited (since they did not have a Sport on their lot). As we pulled back in the lot I asked if they could run an appraisal on my F150 while we test drive a Ford Edge. He said they would not consider running an appraisal on my truck unless I was serious about purchasing a vehicle and we started talking ""numbers."" Dale said the reason is because the amount they offer for my trade is contingent on what we discuss regarding the purchase price of the vehicle. This was a little disturbing since the amount they would give me for my trade was ""contingent"" upon whether I would do business with them or another dealership. It wasn't until I was getting ready to leave that he said he could have an appraisal done. He apologized if he seemed to come off rude, but said it was because he had a migraine the last 2 days. We went inside and he brought the Sales Manager (Harry) over to discuss my interest in purchasing an Explorer. I explained I wasn't too impressed with the Limited and wanted to test drive a Sport, but they did not have one on their lot. Harry said they could write everything up for a Sport (even though I didn't test drive one yet) and have one delivered to their lot. If I wasn't happy with it I could bring it back and we can ""work everything else out."" Needless to say they lost my trust and the salesman lacked professionalism. The following day I went to Berge Ford (who had the Sport I was originally looking for) and was greeted by a salesman named ""Taff."" He was professional and willing to assist. We test drove a Sport and he was more than willing to have an appraisal done on my F150. He did not lose interest when I mentioned I was considering a lease and I did not feel pressure to talk ""numbers."" They ended up offering me more for my trade in, were more professional, had the vehicle I was looking for, exceeded my expectations and won my business. I normally don't write reviews about other businesses, but I thought it was important that the buyer beware!",0
"Terribly disappointed that the service has gotten so bad, we will no longer be making this our preferred family night out place. Took a friend here and the kids a few weeks ago to show this friend ""our place"" we love so much. Waiter was absolutely horrible. No drink refills, sat part of our fajitas in front us of for 15 minutes before he returned with our kids food! Then finally returned with one kids  plate. Had to go back for other. We were still missing toppings and tortillas for fajitas and had to sit there for another 25 minutes with no silverware no tortillas and no toppings just staring at sizzling plate of meat! When the waiter finally returned and I let him know how rude that was, he decided not to return to refill drinks and to let heaping piles of plates stack up and to not even return to give us the bill. So after waiting another 45 minutes we decide we are going to leave and tell the hostess that we will pay the manager. The manager implied that this happens all the time with this guy , gave us our meal for free. And let us know that this guy will be on corrective action, which by the way they're not supposed to tell customers but okay thanks. Fast forward to my husband and I actually taking the kids there again thinking that was just one bad experience, and they sat us in a section right by Mr. wonderful waiter. I made sure to let the hostess know we did not want him serving us again as he was horrible to us last time. So we get to wait for another waiter for about 15 minutes Who suffers from resting b face and acts like it's a task to wait on us. Meanwhile Mr. wonderful waiter And his bus boy friend are walking by and laughing and staring The entire duration of our meal. As were walking by the hostess counter on our way out, mr. wonderful is in a gossip corner with them and actually turns to me and says have a nice day and laughs. We will not be returning and apparently manager did nothing with this guy the first time.",0
"This salon is a decent place, and everyone is super friendly but I will not be returning. I'm from out of town and saw all of the great reviews so I stopped in for a spa pedicure and full acrylic set. I was in the pedicure chair for nearly a half hour before the gentleman came over to do the actual pedicure. And then that was over in all of ten minutes, for $30. Next was my nails which was one hell of a mess. He was having issues with his nail file, and seemed to take it out on my nails causing my finger to bleed a few times. Once he was finished and asked if everything looked okay I realized that one nail is a completely different shape (it looks like a hook compared to the rest that are flat and square). Needless to say $58 later, I'm not happy.",0
"The worse experience! While visiting Toronto we stop at this place to have dinner. They have a natural/organic vibe. We order the Tandoori Chicken Magic Pizza. It was horrible, I like spicy food and it was so spicy and horrible that we could not eat it. I told the waiter that I didn't like it and she asked the manager. The solution they offered was to dip the pizza in BBQ sauce so we could eat it!!!! It was the worse service I have ever received in my life. We didn't eat it they never offered a different dish. It was like ""you can eat it or leave it there, we don't care if you like it or not."" They brought me a check for $35 for a horrible pizza that I didn't eat and never tried to make amendments.   Avoid this place. Horrible.",0
"Worst customer service ever! I live nearby and have stopped by when I'm desperate. The place is run by high school kids and managers who are kids themselves. I've had a few wrong orders, a few experiences where a meal took over 10 minutes to come and a few times where my order never came at all because it wasn't on their queue. My final experience with this place was when I ordered 2 chocolate sundaes in drive thru. There was fudge all over the lid and it felt rock hard and totally congealed. I got out of the drive thru and walked in to exchange it. The cashier said they ran out of fudge as she pointed to the sundae machine behind her which had an open empty container for where the fudge cylinder goes and the clear markings of someone scraping the cylinder for the remaining fudge bits to fill up my sundae. I was DISgusted that they would do this. I asked for the manager, who seemed to be slightly embarrassed but unapologetic. It wasn't until I asked him if he would eat the sundae that he apologized. The one good thing about this McDonalds is that it makes you not want to eat McDonalds ever again. I haven't been back in months mainly because this place sucks so bad. Thank you for your poor customer service. My heart and body are very grateful for your shortcomings.",0
Do Not Go Here!! If you want your skin scratched this is the place to go. Seriously you have one job. The service was good in the beginning and then all of a sudden I noticed the company is breaking down. They don't even help you clean off your face once their done threading your eyebrows from previous sessions. The hairs are all over your face.So when I went to get my money back and I told them hey you scratched my face. They didn't even apologized! Come on that was messed up.,0
"I was extremely happy to have gotten a cello, even if it had a small crack. The sales woman was almost laughing when she saw the brand and told me over and over how she hoped I didn't pay much for it. She told me how cheap it was and how everyone had to repair this kind. I told her it was ok because I was happy with it. So she proceeded to compare it to expensive brands and show me what else was wrong with mine. I am still happy to have it and will pick it up before any work is done on it. Maybe I can't afford a $2000 cello, but I am very happy to have one at all. Very rude woman.",0
"This was my first visit here. Although, the poutine is good but for a restaurant which has built its back bone on poitine, needs to be a bit better.  The onions were completely burns (pepto bismol here I come). I'd say their poutine is on par with BK aside from variety of toppings. Enjoy",0
"Ok this place was was poppin back in 2014 now it's bunk as fk, I've should of gone to Pinas not that it's better but I bet it's poppin'...I came in on Thursday only 6 peeps here on karaoke night and one girl sound like a cat in the dryer! Wtf!",0
"I got a shellac manicure and it was awful. The esthetician used (poor quality) cotton balls to clean between layers of polish that the fine strings of cotton were sticking to my nails. I realized after it was done, the strings of cotton balls were stuck in between the layers of polish and so made the polish look bumpy and ugly. I won't return.",0
Waited forever for them to figure out we couldn't have our little dog outside because it was too hot to leave him in the car.   Manager was useless and said Service dogs only...    won't stop here again!,0
"I had high hopes for the tortas here because of the good reviews. Sadly, my torta was small, dry and tasteless. I had the carne asada torta with everything. The bread was very dry. Maybe it was a bad cook idk, it was just a very bad torta.Also, since they have a good selection of paletas, you would think they'd have arroz con leche",0
"My friend and I wanted to get a massage. We looked at reviews and decided to go here. I got a 90 minute foot massage and my friend got a 90 minute combination massage. The lady that was doing my foot massage spent so much time on the top of my foot, and ankle which is very boney and doesn't feel good to massage. She also spent a lot of time on my toes...I get foot massages once a week where I live and they are amazing. It appeared the lady doing my massage was older and wanted to massage the top of my foot and ankle because it was easier. I finally spoke up and pointed to the calf of my leg. She did massage my calf but seemed aggravated that she had to massage it...This massage wasn't very good but of course I still tipped . The amount was 52.00 and I gave her 60.,, 8.00 tip for an ok massage. Well the owner or person in charge told me the lady worked hard and I needed to give her a 15.00 tip!!!! Really!!!! Don't tell me how to tip number one and number 2 that's exactly what it is A TIP!!!! I didn't have to give anything. I have never been to a business where they try to tell you what to give!  So rude and unprofessional. I think I should have asked to see their license because I think the older lady that did my massage was probably not licensed or she needs to learn to massage on the bottom of the feet where you actually have something  to massage. I would never go back to this business and I don't recommend them. Horrible customer service, rude and they need to learn what they are doing. Quit expecting tips!!!! No one has to give them.!!!  I think if the owners paid a good wage they wouldn't tell you what to tip,,, I'm sure they don't pay them much and they want the customer to make it up!!! I own a business which also is in the tip industry, but I pay my employees very well so they don't have to ask for more money in tips and realize that's exactly what it is !!! A Tip!!!",0
"I normally don't complain, but this needs a complaint. First, I'm very big into customer service and I just received some of the worst customer service. I called this place to make an appointment for my mom and me. I was told to just walk in. That's fine. No problem there at all. I walk in with my mom, get barely a greeting, we sign in and sit down to wait. This is when I notice that they only take cash, which was not stated on their site. That's fine, we have cash and there's an ATM. We wait and as we are waiting one of their regulars comes in and sits without even signing in. While the stylist is finishing up she comments to her regular about doing color. I'm waiting to be called as my name is next on the list and I'm not called. The regular goes and sits to start her service. The stylist then comes over and tells me that she's going to put the color on her regulars hair and we'll be next. Ok, a few things wrong with this. If you tell me no need for an appointment and you have one already booked, why have me walk in and wait?  Why didn't you tell me that there is an appointment ahead of me and schedule appropriately?Why have a sign in sheet if it's not enforced, even for regulars?Lastly, the better way to have handled this situation would have been to come over to me and ask me if it would be ok for you to start her color before taking me, especially since I was there First and had already been waiting a good length of time.",0
"The one star is for the movers who packed my stuff up & delivered it three months later because they were efficient. Otherwise, I'd be giving negative stars.Let's start from the beginning. What they quote you is nowhere near what you will actually pay. I was also told that I only had to pay for the first month of storage up front & could pay the other two months when I paid for the drop off since it would only be two more months.The people in the office are rude & no help once you're done paying. I'm missing half of my large L shaped desk. They forgot one whole crate during initial drop off & had to go back to get the rest. On top of the inconvenience, I was still forced to pay the unloading time of that second trip. I was promised a refund if I contacted the customer service manager. I've called & left messages with no response. I didn't even get to finish my sentence before a rude man who answered just transferred me to someone's voicemail. One of my TVs is not working. I knew right away when I saw them unload the box that it had been through hell. Now that they've got my money for the shitty service, no one cares to talk to me. But they didn't hesitate to pick up the phone to call me when they wanted to collect my payment for storage that I was ""late"" on despite being told I didn't have to pay until my items were delivered. Save your sanity. I would've rather dish out more money for better service than the crap I'm dealing with.",0
"This place sucks , I came to this place and do employment drug test. Waited 30 min. holding my pee for the test they did not call me yet so I used the restroom then, so when they finally call did not have enough for the cup, then waited 1 hr and half again to try again. I have to tell them it's been almost 2 hrs. already. This place is not good never go back and not to recommend to anybody.",0
"The food is average here like any other subway if they pay attention to you and make it right.I stopped in here for lunch after I dropped something off at the nearby post office.  So I order my foot-long Black Forest ham sandwich on wheat.  Well at least they got the bread right.As I was looking for my bag of chips I glanced back to see they were making a Tuna sub for me instead of the black forest ham.  When I caught the guy, he threw back the cheese into the bin, scooped off the tuna salad and then proceeded to use the same bread for my sandwich.  That's when he finally asked me if I wanted new bread which of course I said yes.  But i still got the same cheese.When finishing the sandwich this guy obviously couldn't remember three things at once because I had to remind him of the tomatos twice and the oregano.  I don't think I'll be returning to this location anytime soon.",0
"You get what you pay for (except for the resort fee) and the Luxor is no exception. The lackluster room was outdated and several places in the hotel looked like an abandoned warehouse. The wallpaper was peeling, the doors were dirty, the A/C and heating unit  was old and noisy, and the refrigerator looked like it had been dropped a few times.The service as just as lackluster. The line to check in was ridiculously long. Luckily, we were able to use mobile check-in so we skipped the line. The service was awful, too. We had a question about the bill and the bell desk guy sent us to the concierge. We knew that was wrong, but he insisted. Of course, the concierge sent us back to the bell desk. Someone there finally directed us to the checkout line, which wasn't as long as the check-in line. Lastly, someone came to our room at 10 a.m. to unlock the safe that a previous guest had locked. I asked if they had left anything in the safe and the serviceman said no. I told him to come back later. Checkout is at 11 a.m., so there was no reason he could not have waited do this between the hours of 11a-3p when they're getting the rooms ready.We stayed the one night then checked into the Delano.In spite of the lackluster rooms and service, the outside of the hotel was gorgeous, especially at night. The view through the slanted windows was nice. The hotel also had some of the best shows in Vegas, in my opinion.",0

"STUPID, INCONSISTENT, DRESS CODE: Went out with a group of friends for a fun Saturday night. Mill ave is a college town and very casual. There aren't any bars that enforce a strict dress code. (That's what Scottsdale is for) after waiting in line for about 10 min one of our friends was denied entry because of his Jordan's. They were considered ""basketball shoes"" and apparently basketball shoes aren't allowed. WTH???! Mind you- we have been to multiple El Hefe's around the valley (West Gate and Scottsdale) and he was wearing Jordan's  those times too, and we were never told anything. From the outside, you could see other people inside the bar wearing Nikes, vans, converse, boots... in my opinion, Jordan's are way nicer than your average sneaker. Not sure if this was a race issue due to the inconsistency of enforcing their so called ""dress code"", but unfortunately they lost my service for good... we went to multiple bars after that, with no issues with dress code at all! Don't waste your time coming here!!!",0
Bad service bad food didn't have their two signature drinks on a NFL Sunday before the game. Not a good place to go before the game and can't be a good place to go after. The nachos were a mess and ravioli were still frozen in the middle.,0
I loved Fukushima burger last time I had it but this time it dropped the ball hard. I ordered delivery through door dash. I got a Fukushima burger the chicken burger and some fries. I asked for extra crispy since they would get soggy in the drive over. What was delivered was a chicken burger that can only be described as burnt. And the fries would be considered raw. I won't be ordering from here again if this is what they think is acceptable food to send out at the cost of 25 dollars for two people.,0

"We played 11 holes this morning and the front nine was in rough shape. We waited at every shot on the back nine and it took about 45 minutes to finish two holes. It was so bad the course employee that played with us left and said it was way too slow!! Typically, the front desk will offer some sort of voucher or discount for feature use. When we asked the guy at the front he started yelling at us. As a business owner I can say this is the WORST management team I have ever seen! I will contact the ownership directly and notify them of my poor experience!  Stay far away from this place!!!!",0
"DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE VERBALLY ABUSED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I bought a package on groupon and I was very excited for a new experience. Maryanna was my therapist and she was so pleasant, professional, and down to earth. After my first session I immediately scheduled my next two for the following week. When I called a few days later to confirm my appointments Tannis answered the phone and told me that I was not scheduled at all. I was so confused after watching Maryanna enter my new appointments into the system. I asked Tannis if she could have Maryann return my call so I could remind her that we did schedule and see what may have happened. Tannis told me that she COULD NOT leave a message for my therapist Maryanna and that I could call back Monday if I wanted to get ahold of her. I called back Monday and again Tannis answered and REFUSED to leave a message for my therapist. Tannis told me that she was the owner and she could help me and that she ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT relay a message to my therapist. Long story short, Tannis, the owner messed up the schedule, refused to admit it, and FORBADE me to speak with my therapist, knowing that she made a mistake and was so VERY VERY rude to me.    I PREPAID for an extra three sessions and a jade body relaxation treatment. MY INTERACTION WITH THE OWNER TANNIS CAUSED SO MUCH ANXIETY that I prefer to LOOSE the money than receive any other services from there. THIS PLACE REVIVANATION IS NOTHING BUT A BIG PAIN IN THE COLON!!!!!!!!!!!          DO NOT FALL FOR IT.    THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.      !!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"I ordered a whiskey and a glass of water. The waitress brought me my whiskey, but not the water. No big deal I thought, her tray was full since it was busy, so I waited. She never came back. I figured thats cool I can save time by getting it from the bartender. Wow did it turn into a huge ordeal! The counter at the bar wasn't really busy, just two or three people ordering ahead of me. When the bar tender came near I asked if I could get a glass of water. He said nothing, never looked up, never nodded didnt acknowledge me. I wasn't sure if he heard me, but I'm not pushy so I gave him time to finnish what he was doing. Soon he was taking orders of people who were after me. Now I'm thinking this guy is ignoring me on purpose. Why? Cause I'm ordering something that is free and he can't be bothered to poor a glass of water? I was like hey you guys don't serve water here? Then he yells I'm busy, and he said something about being stressed. What is that all about? You're in a service industry. Is this a thing in bars where if you order water, servers laugh and say good luck to you? I was planning on having a few more drinks, but obviously this is not a place I want to spend time in. Loss of sales for a few drinks($20-$50) loss of a customer for life($20,000-$30,000) multiplied by who ever else I talk to, or reads this? Not sure, but I don't think that's good for business.",0
"Horrible customer service, scratched, dirty cars, STAY AWAY! I have rented from Hertz at other locations many times, but never had such a bad experience as I had at the Ahwatukee location. The staff is very rude and slow. Really, my experience with them has been awful.",0
"Garbage service never achieves promised speeds, costs double what it would in any remotely competitive market, TV requires you to buy their equipment. Their stores are a ""take a number and wait"" mess. Equipment is substandard and often needs replacement, so more trips to take a number and wait.

Completely awful from top to bottom. Save yourself. Run, Run Away",0
"I really wanted to like this place. The menu looked awesome, the prices were fair, and the building is beautiful. However...We walked in (they don't take reservations) and accepted an hour and a half wait. We watched all of the people who were already sitting in the building be sat and tables around the restaurant. Our large party watched an 8-top be cleaned and reset, with salad and appetizers, sit for 20 minutes before anyone sat down. When we asked the hostess about why no one was being sat, they said there were two party's ahead of us; two parties they had already called for with no answer. So not only were we waiting for almost an hour, but the hostess was rude and defensive about the whole situation (right in front of the manager). The table was sat 5-10 minutes later with a party of four. Their food was not nearly good enough for a wait that ended up being almost two hours, but the topper was how the staff treated a large party of paying customers. Tl/dr: Very disappointing. Don't waste your time.",0
"I assumed tuna rolls would be ok from an Asian restaurant. This was hands down the worst sushi rolls I've ever had. In fact I've had considerably better and fresher pre-made sushi from my local Whole Foods or any other decent supermarket or even a large deli in Manhattan. It was my own fault for ordering this I guess. Hot and Sour soup was so salty it was inedible. Beef Fried rice was ok. Cauliflower fried rice was the best thing I sampled. Door dash went from a 35min estimate to 75-90 after half an hour. Awful. Phone rang forever and no answer. Finally, at least management was willing to refund our order. But then they were able to somehow deliver on time after all. Wouldn't order again.",0
"How disappointing.  I have taken my two dogs here for grooming four or five times.  They have been fine.  Today, I got a call from the groomer stating that my OES had a tick in her muzzle and when she shaved it off, some of the skin came off.  She had the vet on duty look at it and they got it to stop bleeding.  It was passed off very casually.When I went to pick up the dogs, I was rushed out without getting a chance to look over the wound.When I got home, I was shocked.  The wound is quarter size!  I called the office and was put on hold (for the third time today, and was on hold 2 1/2 minutes) and when they answered, was told the vet that saw my dog was with another family.  I said I would hold as I wanted to know what kind of wound care.Turns out the vet said she had expected to see my dog once again before she was discharged and was surprised the dog was discharged without her seeing the wound again.  I said it was reprehensible that they didn't call me when the dog was hurt as I live (literally) two minutes away and could have been there.  I was appalled at the casual attitude of the groomer and was advised how to care for the wound by the vet.  She told me I could bring the dog in again for her to review her and I told her I would be just plain stupid to come back.  I advised the vet I would be taking my dog to our own vet and would expect AZ Avenue to pay for the visit.  I told them I (obviously) wanted a refund and still cannot believe they would have (1) hurt the dog (2) lied to me and (3)  charged me for their services.",0
"Liars work here, be carefulI had my car towed in there at the beginning of July because the engine had seized (my fault). The car was due to be returned at the end of its lease. I found out on July 21st that they were trying to get ahold of my friend (person that got it towed for me since I live in Cali) to figure out what is going on with the car. I flew into Las Vegas for the day on the 29th in order to try to get this resolved. Spoke to Sergio who was handling it, and he introduced me to the service manager who went over the cost of repairs. After getting that figure I went back to Sergio to see what other options I had. My friend who towed the car in was in the market for a car as well.  My options on the 29th were to turn car in as is ~$8,000, fix and turn in ~$7,500, or trade it in and have my friend purchase a vehicle to help cover the fees on the trade. My friend went in that weekend to do a credit check and was told he would need to look for a car around $30k to mask the penalty on the trade. We've both tried numerous times since that weekend to get ahold of him and even tried talking to Sales Managers only to be blown off and sent to Dummy voicemails. No VMs have been returned. I called Kia Lease End Services yesterday to explain I was trying to handle the trade in and explained all of this. Tasha was able to get Sergio on the phone magically (maybe my phone number didn't show up??) and she was told that they just found of they had the car last week and they've been bending over backwards to help my friend or me take care of this issue but we are wasting their time and dodging them. I tried explaining to Tasha that they are lying and I have flight records, phone calls, witnesses that drove me over there (family), but now they are just going to ""ground the car"" because we've been non-compliant. These people are crooks and I will be taking this as high as I can go, up to the State Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau because I have all the evidence to prove they were lying about what they told the agent on the phone.",0
"Initially tried to exchange my UNWORN shoes and security and manager said they looked worn. I was trying to exchange them because I had gotten the display shoe that ended up being loose but the manager sarcastically said ""Really? Because it looks like both shoes were worn."" Whatever. I proceed to look for the same shoe and size, but this one was dirty too and the laces were torn up. So I just wanted to get my money back. They refused to do a refund because my shoes were ""worn."" Mind you, if you look at the bottom of any white shoe in their store, there will be some minor dust. If I had worn them, wouldn't the shoes be creased? And wouldn't the sole have more than a few specks of dust? And why was the display shoe considerably ""dirtier"" than the one that wasn't? What, I'm walking around with one shoe? Maybe it was because it was the DISPLAY SHOE and people were wearing it??? Security, manager, and cashier were rude and unhelpful. Didn't even try to hear me out. Went to a different branch and they returned it NO PROBLEM. Don't go to this one. Save yourself the headache.",0

Do not stay here even if it's for just 1 night. This place is a complete dump. You walk into the lobby and it's a complete mess. Than I went into my room and it smelled like cigarettes. Two of the lamps didn't work so the lighting is awful. Most of the channels on the television didn't work. The microwave didn't work. The water in the tub doesn't go down the drain. But what topped the whole stay was in the morning they had no syrup for my damn waffle.Let me repeat do not stay at that completely and utter dump. If I could give this shit hole no stars I would.,0
"Went around 8pm today, only because the wait at Buffalo Wild was 30 mts. The food was terrible. I ordered a steak omelette & my son ordered the country steak. My omelette was very dry old  & the steak tasted very old too. The cheese on top was not even melted as usual. Came out of this place with a terrible bad after taste in my mouth. Waitress was ok, but looked and spoke very lethargic.What has happened to the IHOP I used to know ???",0

"Scents:They have some pretty good scents you can't get elsewhere. But some are hit and misses. I got a really stale one once that smelled like stale water. They would not replace it. Also be wary of the reviews of each fragrances. They often don't post your negative reviews, and post all of your positive reviews.  This kind of makes it misleading and false. Containers:I usually get the discounted ones. Products are pretty good. BUT someone can't count in their packaging dept. They always give you less than what is specified. I am always missing a cap or something. They would not resend the missing ones to you.Customer service: Really bad. They don't resend missing pieces or bad products. They also aren't knowledgeable about the products they sell. I got quite a few rude ones. Butters:I bought cocoa butter 6/2010. Expiration on it says 6/2011. It actually went rancid by 4/2011. Cocoa butters is very stable and will keep for about five years and resist going rancid. They were probably selling old butters for super high prices.Prices:Yup I agree with the other review: They increased their prices too much for fragrances. One good thing though is that their shipping is free.Overall, purchase at your own expense. They take no responsibility over anything.",0
"So I walk in and said I was so sorry I'm 10 mins late but I was trying to call you guys and tell you that I was right out side trying to turn in but couldn't because traffic is so backed up in the morning. And she said it's ok no problem, so I sat down and 20 mins later she calls me up to the desk and said since I was late the altrasound tech moved on the the next appointment and I was up set because they couldn't tell me while I was sitting in the waiting room for 20 MINUETS FOR NOTHING!! And the office Manager lady is so rude she stands there and yells at me in front of everyone and says I'm 30 mins late for my appointment and I said no I was 10 mins late because it's so hard to turn in here in the morning and I tried to call but all 20 of these receptionist working here had better things to do rather then there job. And she just tells me go to another location further then Val vista and if I don't she's going to tell my NP that I denied getting treated. She acted like a child. I don't see her working there for long anyways. They always call you a hour before you're schedule appointment and say that you're Dr or Np is unavailable and to see someone else, I probably met every Dr, Nurse, Midwife there. Because mine was never available. I didn't care that much but it was just annoying explaining my whole situation again and again, because they knew nothing about me. They also called me one time at like 12:30 and asked if I can go to a different location at 12:40, I advised no I can I won't make it there in just 10mins that's not enough heads up time for that, they did that to me Twice , it doesn't make since to do that , oh yes lady I will stop what I'm doing and gun it to this new place you want me to go to. Yeah not happening. This place is absolutely a nightmare and beware coming here because they will always turn you away and everyone in there is just so rude while you're going through a pregnancy or whatever your case may be. Overall my service here was absolutely awful. I don't recommend Anyone to come here! It was stressful and I thank God that I don't have to come here anymore. Thanks VWFW. NOT!!!!",0

"I asked the wait staff if an item on their menu was gluten free, and they told me I was in luck. I found out later that evening from another staff member that the food I had eaten was actually not gluten free. All the hotel did was offer to buy my glass of wine for me. I'm sorry but there is literally nothing that can make up for the week of symptoms I will be enduring from my food allergy. They had also burned my dinner and I had to send it back, when they also offered to take my drink off the bill. Buying drinks does not make up for absolutely terrible service.",0
"Omg.. this place seriously  got me sick after i ate the chicken. It tasted a bit funky and i didnt eat all of it but i had to go to the bathroom many many times that same evening.  I will never  go here again. I literally  had nothing  else that day. I had the food  here for lunch and was nauseous  by dinner time. isnt the health dept supposed  to prevent stuff like this?  I mean obviously  not every restaurant  is  gonna end up being completely  sanitary.  So, that is why there is a  health  dept.I wish I  could  give  zero stars",0

"Was given a ""free pizza"" coupon from one of Bubba's employees. Went to the restaurant (Peoria, AZ) and ordered a beer and 15 wings to go with my ""free pizza"". I was told that the coupon was good only if I bought an entree. I was ordering a more expensive appetizer than a normal entree. I was going to spend almost $25 for my ""free pizza"", before tip. I spoke to a manager who told me to have a nice day and moved on, his name was David and the ""salesman"" who scammed me into a ""free pizza"", was a marketing guy. I never was given a chance to try the food. I live right down the street and will never grace the place.",0

Lol I finally ordered a double skewer and the chicken was dry as rubber and the portion was so little. Absolute waste of money and rip off. Low quality food.Will not return.",0
"I go to a lot of doctors. Dr. Loo is by far the worst Doctor I've ever been to. I saw him first when I was about 13 and ended up sticking with him whenever I got sick, and needed to see a doctor right away. Every time I left that place I would promise myself I wouldn't come back. 8 years later and I am scheduling a physical with a new doctor so I can be patient status with someone else. Sometimes I feel like the reception girls and Dr Loo are all related, because they have same condescending expression and super defensive attitude. Loo comes in and rushes through everything and doesn't sit down and listen. The first time I saw him I went about stomach aches. After hardly talking to him he prescribed and antidepressant. Then I came back years later for fatigue and lightheadedness. He didn't listen to everything I had to say and kept interrupting and rushing everything. Then ended up giving me antidepressants again. When those gave me migraines, he told be to see a psychiatrist. Maybe stomach aches and fatigue are not mental illnesses? For someone who is already uncomfortable going to the doctors Dr Loo is literally the worst. I will say I remember seeing the lady Doctor there. She was just the sweetest. I only saw her when Dr Loo was too busy.",0
"Was playing the video craps machine and the point was on 10. The dice rolled 5, 5 and the whole table was set to be paid when the game froze. Casino management came over and denied it happened. They reset the game and everyone got their bet back but not their winnings. 12 people should have been paid and the casino refused to pay anyone what they were owed. I understand casino games are rigged to begin with and the odds are against you but when you win they should pay what your owed! They said the game malfunctioned. Take a look at the photo and tell me if this looks like a malfunction.. dice clearly say 10 and take a look at my bet, you can make your own determination if this was a malfunction or a casino refusing to pay.",0
"This was the only place open at the hotel when we got there.  A friend of ours said it wasn't too bad.  I guess that's open for interpretation!!  What ""isn't too bad?""  What do you compare that to?  I suppose food at 2am after a long flight and drinking limits your tasting abilities.  This place was horrible.  Service was terrible.  The waitress could barely understand our orders.  She constantly repeated herself and your order and still didn't get it right.  We were seated what seems like forever before someone came over.  It took forever to get drinks and food.  The only thing going for it is the prices were pretty cheap (this is Vegas we're talking about).  But then again so was the service and food.  Beware of the Sherwood Forest Cafe!!",0

"I started ordering from this L&L for the last 3 - 4 months or so because of the reviews. Up till now, I felt this location made the best Spam Fried Rice, compared to the other locations I've tried, until last Thursday.I ordered 2 Spam Fried Rice last Thursday night, for myself & wife. When I first opened my order, I thought they just gave me plain fried rice until I noticed that there were a few pieces of spam in mine. Had to really move rice around to even find a piece of spam.I thought maybe more spam ended up in my wife's order but upon checking her order, found the same with hers.Could not have been much more than 1/2 to one slice of spam, if even that, chopped up in each container. Had to really move rice around to even find a piece of spam.I wouldn't have been too upset if they told me they ran out of spam but would makeup for it the next time I order, but they never said anything.I ordered ""to go"" & still tipped them as I usually do, even if I order to go.I'm sure the female cashier didn't know of this but the deceitful cook surely knew what he was doing. If I order from this location again, I will check my order before paying & leaving.Not preparing the food properly is one thing & sometimes happens. But Cheating the customer should not ever be allowed by L&L.1 Star for this L&L in general.""0"" Star for the Spam Fried Rice-5 Star for the Deceitful cook!",0

Awful!My friend and I went at 1am. There was no list to sign to know who was next so of course we had a girl who cut us when we were supposed to be next. I got a pedicure. $35 for a pedicure I could have done a better job. She barely cut my toenails. Didn't push my cuticle. And the nail polish she put on me was poodled when it dried. She did a horrible job and I felt it was way too expensive. They don't like their jobs and it shows. My friend got a gel manicure. It was super thick and had bumps all over :/ at least hers was only $20. Which doesn't make any sense how a basic pedi is more expensive than a gel manicure.I will never go back. The only thing they have going for them is that they are open 24 hours. But they should be closed 24 hours. Awful awful awful. You can check my reviews I hardly ever give a bad one. This is my first 1 star and to be honest it only got 1 because there is no option for no stars. Still feeling stupid for going there.,0
"OMG!  This was the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.  First of all, it wasn't even ""Chinese"" food.  Ordered a Buddha's Delight and it consisted of cheap supermarket variety vegetables; carrots, celery, zucchini, onions (lots of thrm) and bell peppers, piled up in giant chunks smothered in some sort of tasteless brown sauce.  It basically was a pile of cheap super market vegetables in a pile.  Where are the Chinese vegetables?  A Buddha's delight dish consistes of bean sprouts, a variety of assorted mushrooms, i.e., shiitake, enochi and other varities  No mushrooms to be found.  Where were the water chestnuts?  The bamboo shoots?, Bok choy? Again, none.  All the other dishes had the identical  same cheap assorted vegetables. The bourbon beef which was tough as shoe leather and the the black pepper chicken has itsy bitsy peices of tough chicken, which were barely noticeable smothered in the same tasteless soupy brown sauce. The plates were so small there was barely  room for one small dish and some rice.  The dead giveaway of a fake Chinese restaurant is when your tea arrives at your table with a commercial tea bag dangling out of the pot.  Disgusting!!!!!  Cheapest fortune cookie wrapped in cellophane that you find at every fast food Chinese take-out.Shame on the owners.",0
"I brought my 3 year old son to see Dr. Stewart after he broke his arm and if it weren't for the fact that my kid's pediatrician said he's one of the best in town I would not have tolerated this place as long as I did. My son had traumatic experiences with this office each time he went there! The way the X-ray tech tried to yank his arm around to get a good shot, when it was broken, made my little guy scream and shake and sweat. I understand that sometimes with little kids there comes a time where you have to just do it but there was no kind, coming down to his level or warming him up talking. He literally yanked his arm into different positions like a piece of chicken bone ready to be chopped. For some reason we kept getting stuck with this nurse Bill. He's a friendly guy but very arrogant and I don't understand why he's working in a pediatric office. In fact, I don't understand why most of the staff there decided to work with kids if they can't treat them as such. My son is used to going to my pediatrician's office where the nurses come down to his level and are sweet and kid-like to all the children. Sure, there are times when they have to just hold him down for a second before giving him a shot or something but not before giving him a chance or treating him with respect. After each experience with the staff my son would be crying, shaking and dripping in sweat by the time Dr. Stewart would come in and then when he'd come over to look at his arm my son would not want to be touched. I mentioned this to Dr. Stewart and he said my son had behavioral problems!!! I was shocked that he had the audacity to make such a statement about my son just because he pushed the dr away because he touched his broken arm after it had just been mercilessly yanked around by the staff who didn't even hardly talk to him while they did it! Also, my son is the last 3 year old you would ever diagnose with behavioral problems or anything even close. If I could factor that in it would make sense but that was just a bad judgement call on Dr. Stewart's part. During one follow up at this place, after the 30 min car ride with my son crying in the car because he was terrified to go in, I finally was in tears after the X-ray tech came in to impatiently take my son for another X-ray when he was crying again. I told him to just stop and for everyone to just give my kid a break. When he asked what was wrong I told him how I felt and he did admit to me that it's hard with so many kids and he let me sit there till my son was ready to go in. That experience was the first calm one. Then...when Dr. Stewart came in and saw that i had obviously been crying he asked what was wrong. After I proceeded to tell him where I was coming from as a mother and how terrified my child is each time he comes here he started defending his staff instead of truly hearing me. You can make of that what you want... The last thing I want to say is that when it came time for my son's cast to be removed Bill came in with that strange looking machine with the steel blade and told my son to hold still. My little guy who looked like he had been through the wringer took one look at the blade and started sobbing with terror. Instead of perhaps calming him down because you know he's only 3 years old Bill started talking to him like he was a teenager telling him to hold still or he's gonna call people in to hold him down. Once the cast came off my son sat there continuously crying and sweating and there I was totally confused as to why he was still in so much pain. Bill had left the room immediately without explaining to me that when the cast comes off it's possible for the child to still be in a lot of pain for a few days as he gets used to not having the cast on. I sat there trying to hold back my tears wondering what was going on and it was only until another staff member came in and explained it to me that I understood it was normal. Perhaps next time it could be explained before the cast comes off. My regret as a mother is that I didn't speak up to Bill in that moment or do more to help my child when he was going to that office. I did some, but I should have done more. This review is about a year overdue so I sincerely hope they've changed staff since then or at least changed something so no other kid has to go through what mine went through. Breaking a bone is traumatic enough. I think it's important to not only take your child to a good surgeon but also to an office that has competent, professional, kind, kid-friendly staff.",0
"I was having a lovely day walking down mount royal street when my friends and I neared Paul Boutique. One of my friends delighted me with a fun fact that Paul Boutique looks small but has an impressive back room with a collection of vinyls that just had to be seen! I was especially delighted since i've been a Montrealer since 2013 and have never known about this boutique.We were a group of four, with only one of us having been to the location once before. We walked in and shared a casual smile and nod with the men in the front of the store and made our way to the back. We were in awe...for just about 5 seconds until a man from the front confronted us and said ""..this is a privileged area..."" ""...you can't have bags..."" etc. all in a quite unpleasant tone. We quickly apologized, returned to the front of the store and stated that we didn't know there were rules. He continued by saying ""...this isn't some public government place where you can go anywhere you like..."" ""...people these days just feel so privilege and that they can go anywhere..."" ""...you don't even say hi to us and you just walk into the back of the store..."" ""...you have to be invited to the back..."" and finally as we were attempting to leave the store after profusely apologizing, he tried to continue his sermon but ended with ""...no, this conversation is over."" I would have stayed and browsed the front of the store but unfortunately the only way to end his tirade was to leave the store.  I want to address those that think ""if he's mean to you it's because you deserve it"". That's not true, if he doesn't want people walking in the back then there should be some CLEAR signage stating ""do not enter"" or ""staff only."" Yelling at new customers who wander into his ""privileged"" area without the knowledge that it's ""privilege"" is not the solution. I felt that we were treated quite arbitrarily in this store. I love small businesses but I would not advise shopping here and supporting a store that focuses more on their arbitrary rules than fostering positive relationships with curious music lovers.",0
I have come so many times to this location and have been in love with Corner Bakery. This time they screwed up my order big time. I ordered a trio option and the quinoa salad had an ingredient that had gone bad so I threw that out and my second choice was cavatappi pasta salad and they gave me chicken salad instead and I am a vegetarian so threw that out. So all I ate was hummus and pita for 8 bucks. They need to provide training to their order takers. The dude was so confused. I don't think I will go there again.,0
"They say not to judge a book by its cover, but how can you not when the owner thinks it's funny to put on the billboard ""Your Mom Ruined My Head Board Last Night""? Is that supposed to make me want to come in? I did, mainly to complain and was greeted by your typical Las Vegas club like mentality. The food was terrible and the service was comparable to sitting in a buffet and never getting a refill.",0
"If I could leave a zero, I would. Horrible experience this afternoon. Went in with a coworker for lunch. Planned on eating there, but due to the circumstances ended up eating at Jersey Mikes right next door.I don't write reviews often at all this is my 5th in a couple years, but am compelled to do so today. We ordered food, several people behind us ordered food and were served before us, if you know this place the menu is simple and no reason why our order of chicken should take longer than the next persons. Then, one of the customers walked back in with the food she was given, told the cashier it was the wrong food, cashier tried to blame the customer for grabbing the wrong bag. I also overheard the customer ask the cashier 2 times if she was grabbing the right bag, cashier confirmed. So cashier made the mistake but blamed the customer. So that container of food was put back on the counter, cashier showed the cook and said it was wrong, cook opened the container and did something to the food. Then the cashier grabbed that container along with another one and tried to serve to my coworker. Very unsanitary, very unorganized, and rude. Manager didn't seem to care. I will never go to this location ever again. If you want to eat food that have been handled by people other than the employees here, go for it!",0
Food is not as great as the previous reviews. The only thing I enjoyed was the steamed white rice and the iced water. Overly priced. Service was quick but food didn't feel made but massly prep'd.. not made to order.,0
Walked out without ordering anything Tried to seat us in the middle of a group then when I said no they sat us next to other folk on a small table .... the place wasn't busy at all plenty of booths available and then the next people that came in were seated at a booth..... we heard them and they hadn't booked this table speciallyIt annoys me when they try give poor seating so ..... they ain't getting my money.,0
I brought my car in for an oil change and a tire rotation five minutes after getting it down the road my engine light kept coming on flashing and my traction control light in my car light I took it back to him two days later he hooked it up to see what code came up seven different codes. mistakes cost me $685,0
"My AC was broken for 1/3 of time I lived here where I could only use my bedroom and could barely sleep due to loud temp unit they placed in my bedroom that only was strong enough to keep bedroom cool.  I could not use my kitchen nor my living room because it was middle of summer and hot!On my last month I wanted to extend 2 weeks, was told over the phone to ""pay what I normally paid"" for a fullMonth then was charged extra $300Had apartment professionally cleaned upon moving- moved out Oct 31st still have not received my deposit back it is Dec 19th.  Despite various emails I can only get deposit from their corporate office who does not respond to my emails.  The office staff at ascent.l is nice but they can't do anything for me",0
"Worst dining experience ever. The food was horribly disgusting and the music was so loud our server couldn't even hear us and got our order wrong. We also weren't able to talk during our entire meal due to the music being so ridiculously loud. Literally could not hear one another. Also, on a Sunday night they patted us down before entering the restaurant. Never have I ever had my purse searched and been patted down before a meal. I wouldn't return if they paid me to dine here.",0
"Oona was brought here for 10 days. I picked her up on a Sunday, and her eyes were heavily and severely crusted with mucus and gook. The owner Debi lied and said it was ""one day"" of gook. LIAR! My dog does not gook . . . they obviously tried to hide the fact that they did not care proper care of her. I asked for a refund and she said no. I took the best photos I could . . . NEVER AGAIN!!!!! I will have to ask my vet if she now has an eye infection. Unless I get a refund, we will meet in small claims court. This is not a threat, but a truth. Stay away!",0
"Not impressed at all. The waitress kept interjecting herself into our conversations. The drinks were empty most of the time. The food was clearly not fresh made. Salad came from a bag. And who splits a hotdog lengthwise and serves it on a piece of bread for a kid's meal? Seriously? What's confusing about this place, and many places in SCW is that the people come here in droves. When you get old, do you somehow lose your tastebuds entirely or are you just willing to accept cheap crap because it's cheap? I just don't understand it. But I will say if my in-laws suggest it again, it will be met with a resounding NO.",0
"This office recommended very pricey dental work for my husband and my 3 year old daughter.  The office refuses to use any metal dental work--opting only to provide costly ceramic and composite dental work.  Additionally, the dentist made a recommendation for very significant dental work on my 3 year old (which would have included a general anesthesia) based on NO xrays.  I found this disturbing and appalling.",0
"Ok so 1st of all I was at Walmart my bf asked me if I wanted a mcdonalds burger? I said no hun let's go to Popeyes because I love their red beans and rice this was at 4pm today. The lady in the drive thru window I asked her for one breast and one small rice and beans, She said Cajun rice? I said No!! rice and and beans, she said Cajun ? I said no rice and beans so at the end of the order she repeated it back to me I thought she said fries so I then asked her did u say fries? She said no!! I said rice and beans right ? she says yes!! I said can u make it a large yes she said.. I was going to eat it in the parking lot but changed my mind and wanted it with my dinner . so I drive 80 miles to get home to the nastiest tasting Cajun rice I've ever tasted in my life.. not only was I furious cause I specified 3 times with a witness of my bf that I said it 3 times if you can't get it right after 3 times u got issues. It's not like I live around the corner, I live fricking 80 miles away!! That's not the end I call them to tell them I'm pissed, nobody answers I called 5 times a recording answers where u can't leave a message. I call 4 more stores finally someone answers at a diff location. I ASK IS THEIR A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAJUN AND RED RICE AND BEANS OF COURSE SHE SAYS YES!!! I called because i thought ok maybe they don't sell rice and beans anymore but as i knew already they do !! If I could give you a triple zero I would cause me telling you 3 times and you still don't get it is a problem. So thank you for ruining my dinner",0
"*Edit 5/30/11:I was mistakenly given Mojgan's name.  If Mojgan ever reads this I profusely apologize!!  I've heard that Mojgan is nothing but sweet and helpful.  I don't know the name of the awful S.A. at this store but I know that she is tall with short dark hair and some kind of European accent who has a sour expression on her face.**Edit 2/28/12:Veronica has moved and no longer works for the company :(  The other sales associate I like is Linda if she is still there.  Very nice woman and always encourages people to try on their shoes.The people who work at this location (and most of the CL boutiques come to think about it) are not the friendliest yet there is one particular person who brings this store down to one star.  Her name is Mojgan (not sure if it's spelled correctly but she's the one with the accent), and she is one of the worst sales associates that I have ever encountered in my life and made my last trip to the store such a disappointment.  Even walking out empty-handed you should leave with that kid in a candy store feeling after being surrounded by all those beautiful shoes, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth instead.Mojgan was not very helpful and seemed unwilling to answer questions and find availability of requested styles.  When she did answer a question, she was very short and often did not answer the question correctly, as if she were answering a totally different question than what was actually asked.  She came off as not very knowledgeable on product and product availability which is unacceptable when your customers are more informed and knowledgeable than the sales associates.  And I've heard that she's the manager of this store.  If so, unbelievable!  I asked for a particular shoe which she said they didn't have only to see minutes later someone trying them on in the store!  She could have at least told me that they had the shoe, just not in my size.  She made it seem like she did not care for my business or the other person I was with (who happens to own countless pairs of ""Loubs""), which is fine because I do not plan on ever giving them any of my business.  I'm turned off to the whole brand now, but it's okay because I have discovered other brands that are sexier, edgier, and less expensive than Louboutins.  Not to mention more comfortable!  Never again, Las Vegas boutique!  However, if you are after some Loubs and must go to this location, go see the young, blonde sales associate who works there.  I believe her name is Veronica.  She is the most pleasant and helpful sales associate at the store.",0
"My experience here was completely horrible. I arrived at 12:30 and didn't leave until 3:30. I came in for a soak off and a full acrylic set. Vicky did not soak off all of my gel before applying the tips for my full set. I asked for a pink acrylic with a little shimmer in it, however... I got something with shells in it, and was very lumpy. I paid $47 for uneven, lumpy, mediocre nails. On top of my nails looking a hot mess, I wasn't discounted anything for having to wait for 2.5 hours to be serviced. I will not return.",0
"I went here with a friend to help her choose a bridal dress -- and let's just say we won't be returning. The staff (minus the salesgirl who said next to nothing,) was rude, didn't listen we'll to my friend's likes, dislikes or requests., and acted like we were putting them out by being there. What's more, the selection was poor at best -- after less than ten dresses, they literally RAN OUT of dresses to put her in. Totally unacceptable. If this is the best bridal shop Pittsburgh has to offer, look elsewhere.",0
"So.  We're at Paris.  Which is supposedly supposed to be all French-ish.My husband ordered the french toast.  I mean really....french toast at a French cafe?  Can't go wrong?  Oh yes you can.  It SUCKED.  My french toast that I make with crappy wheat bread beat this by miles.  And my eggs and bacon?  Meh.  I asked for over-medium, and there was raw egg white in there.  Bacon was floppy, which grosses me out.The only plus is that this was the only negative food experience on our whole trip in Vegas!",0
"I've just had the worst experience with this company so far.. last year my friend and I booked, and we had to cancel because of an unexpected funeral. We informed the company right away, and asked if we could have a refund or if they could honor our sail for the next year (since it was close to the end of the summer season at the time). They said no, and said they guess we could re-book that year but only that year and they usually don't let people cancel with a refund. The only reason I was given my groupon money back was probably because I complained enough times. We thought we'd give this company a second chance, so we re-bought a new groupon for this summer season and booked in May. Our sail was cancelled because there wasn't enough people on the boat. Not only that, when we booked, the company e-mailed us saying that because we booked on a holiday Monday, we'd have to pay extra, and that their website had a glitch and didn't charge us, so they'd just charge the extra bit to our CC. There was no where on their website that stated anything about holidays being extra, only weekends. So I had to email the company, copy and paste their own terms and conditions, just so I could have the extra money back they already charged. So we tried again recently, and again, the sail was cancelled, not enough people on the boat. I asked the company if we can't find a time to go this summer season, since it's now mid august - could we please have it honored for next season... the answer was no. So again, I feel like the company just truly doesn't care about their customer service. We'll try for September but again, most people make their summer plans way in advance and have little wiggle room (aka us). Anyways... we'll either try again in September or... our money will once again be gone to this company. If we do go in September I'll update my review if I feel better about the company itself, but as of right now, I wouldn't bother going through the time to book with this company. Update - we tried again (and paid an extra 20$ to try again on the weekend) and couldn't find parking ANYWHERE near the company ( we tried 6 different parking locations that were all full). Not the company's fault but needless to say we didn't make the sail - and the company is still not extending our vouchers until next year (knowing how much we've tried to go on this trip). SO we call it quits with this company we will never try to purchase another voucher we've wasted so much money! I even bought a hat for about 10$ from their website to wear on my sail and I'm sure I won't even get a refund for that.",0
"I was told I should try the salads here... So I did.  I ordered a strawberry Gorgonzola salad.  I am so disappointed...there were MAYBE 3 strawberries, sliced, maybe a half ounce of Gorgonzola .., and a lot of lettuce.  I don't like a lot of dressing, but I think they left it off altogether... I really hate paying 8.95 for lettuce.,  service was good, food way overpriced for portions.",0
"This is a beautiful hotel and I was impressed. I paid a lot of money for a great suite and the bed was comfortable and the room was beautiful. The shopping centers here are amazing and the potential is there to spend a lot of money. Although I was happy with the room and service I still give the resort a 1 out of 5. Where they fail is with security. I purchased a bottle of Creed cologne from the shops at Cesars. Additionally I Brought my own bottle to use when I went out at night. I decided to get some breakfast with my wife on Saturday and prior to leaving we called housekeeping to come clean. When we got back we came home to fresh towels and a clean room. Unfortunately I came back to missing cologne, the new one and the one I brought from home, as well as my new watch that I purchased in July. I looked everywhere in the room and had no luck. When I called guest relations they sent security up and they took a report from me. No sorry, no nothing. At the end of the day I am taking a loss, and I will deal with it. Overall I am not happy and I would say be very cautious as the Venetian doesn't hire very high integrity employees.",0
"This review  is actually for Moxie's (used to be Kimmy's).First off, same sour, crappy waitress that worked at Kimmy's. The waitress' ""special mix"" bloody mary tasted like high fructose corn syrup crap. Water was never replenished. My steak was like a dead body,- no seasonings and was pale (wtf?). I ordered herbed potatoes as a side, but when my food was brought to me she threw it down and said, ""the potatoes are not ready yet so I substituted fries"". I hate fries! Why would you arbitrarily do that??When the manager asked if everything was ok and we complained, all he said was that was a bummer. Yeah, tell the owner when this dump shuts down here in a month that it was a bummer. Piss poor.",0

"Had a great experience with the sales department. Ruben was 5 starts all the way. I have been dealing with James from the service dept for about 3 months now. First he forgot to order the part for my car and tried to blame other people for it. Then he asked me to send him a picture of the part I need. Picture was sent on Sep 21. I texted him on Oct 1 and 3rd asking for an update and got nothing. I left his supervisor a message, and still got nothing. Customer Relations Managers asked me to contact her directly. I did, but my call and email were dismissed.",0
"Definitely don't go late at night. I've been there twice after 9pm and the staff is horrible. I ordered my smoothie without any added sugar but they made it so sweet I couldn't drink it. I asked it to be remade and again they added sugar. I don't understand...aren't smoothies supposed to be healthy? As I was sitting at the tables outside, some of their staff came out and sat at the next table smoking cigarettes. This is definitely not a good place to go to after a workout at the gym, especially if you're health conscious. I wish there was a Jamba Juice nearby that is open late.",0
"Recently stayed here for business, wouldn't stay here again unless there wasn't another option. Grumpy unproffessional staff and the place itself isn't very nice at all, kinda musty and tight outdated rooms. The whole building isn't well kept...kinda what you'd expect in some rundown hicktown",0
"Roundpoint is a horrible company -- don't believe the fake reviews on Zillow (take a quick look at some of those 5 star reviews and you'll see what I mean. Most of them seem completely fabricated and are written in the exact same language!)First, let me give you the executive summary: First contacted them in February, 2013 for a refinance after them giving me a competitive Zillow quote. Spent 5 months (!!) waiting for them to follow through, during which they promised me my rate was locked. After 5 months my loan was declined for a fake reason (I have proof, below), right when my extended rate lock expired. Long story short, they were ridiculously slow and incompetent, and declined my loan because it didn't make financial sense for them to extend the rate lock further.To go into a bit more detail, I will tell you that pretty much everybody I dealt with: Jason Freeman, Chris Kinson, and others were the very definition of incompetence. Here are a few details about my incident that will give you an idea on their incompetence and on why I KNOW that they're lying with regards to my loan:- I applied in February, and fairly quickly started realizing I may have made a mistake. Communications with them were approximately once every two weeks. I'd hear nothing for a long while, send a slightly unhappy email and receive a one liner response: ""Sorry, we are still working on your refinance"". There were almost ZERO updates initiated by them, during the entire FIVE MONTH process!- At the very beginning, I filled out a standard IRS transcript request. They never mailed it in (I know because the IRS sends you a copy).- In July, they realized it was never sent in so they asked me to fill an updated form because the original form was dated February and the IRS won't accept forms older than 4 months. - I filled it out, then 3 days later received a letter from the IRS: They can't provide the transcript because someone sent the wrong one -- the old form dated February! Not only did Roundpoint fail to send out the request for 4 whole months. When they finally did, they sent out an older form, so the IRS declined. That's how you spend 5 months doing nothing.- The process took so long that at some point I think they thought I needed another appraisal, which they attempted to schedule (which I would have had to pay for). Suddenly they changed their minds.- Finally, on June 25th, I get an email from Jason Freeman saying my loan has been approved by the underwriter, subject to a few items. Needless to say those items were provided within 24 hours. One of those items asks about several credit checks that appeared on my account in the past 5 months. That, coupled with a credit monitoring warning I received on my account, told me that they pulled my credit again on June 24th, one day before the happy ""approval"" email.- Mr. Freeman then disappears for weeks, and I have absolutely no idea where I stand.- I called Lauren Liberto, their Customer Advocate Manager as a final desperate attempt to at least understand what's going on. She promptly got back to me and made an effort to get to the bottom of things. She also indicated to me that I was a few days away from the expiration of my extended rate lock, and that they will extend it at no charge. This is an important point.- I finally hear back from Mr. Freeman, informing me that he has resubmitted with the underwriter for expedited processing (this is now over 5 months since we started!).- A few days later, RIGHT when the rate lock was expiring, they informed me (once again in a two line email) that my refinance was declined due to insufficient credit. My credit monitoring service shows that the last time my credit was pulled was June 24th, so they have received no new information. Why am I being declined?- That's when I received the most amazing document from them: The official Credit Denial letter. Guess why my loan was declined? Due to a low credit score, based on a credit check performed on June 24th, almost 7 weeks earlier. Ironically, that's just one day before I received the happy ""approval"" letter. Clearly they had that information when they notified me I was approved!- So obviously, it had been 7 weeks since they had any new information. Why the sudden decline? Let me spell it out for you: They took their sweet time (due to sheer incompetence), and now it was getting expensive for them to extend the rate lock, so they decided it just wasn't worth it.- Finally, they promised to refund my appraisal fee (appraisal was done by a company affiliated with them, of course). Guess what? I never got it! Surprised? I wasn't.Bottom line: This is just a horrible, incompetent group of people with absolutely no concept of customer service. Stay away at all costs, you've been warned.",0
"Didn't get my order right.I ordered shrimp tacos, different waitress showed up with fish tacos, I pointed that out and was ignored.  Another server came along and after I pointed out the problem offered to make it right but I refused any further changes ( I was out of time). ...just read the comment.  Thanks for the read.  I didn't get the name of our actual server but he was great.  He wanted to make the mistake right, the waitress that ignored me when I pointed out the problem never returned...anyway.

"I came by to visit this store to try out the display models for the Samsung S7, a week after it was released. It was my first time visiting this store and I thought it looked very nice. There were certainly a lot of Samsung representatives available to speak with. I was interested in getting the Samsung S7 Edge, but apparently only the black onyx model was out; the silver and gold colours were not released yet. The representative told me that these would be released on March 28 and she recommended me to ""pre-order"" the device in the colour of my choice. I actually wanted to make use of their promotion where we could bring in any device and get a discount of about $120 off my purchase...this promotion was for up until the end of March. The Samsung representative told me they could not honour the promotion even if I make a deposit on the model I want, which I think is bullshit. Why even bother advertising this stupid promotion if its only limited to one colour model?So, I made a 50$+tax deposit, in hopes that on March 28 I would get my Samsung S7 in silver and that I could also get the 126$ discount by bringing in any old device. On the day I made the pre-order the lady said someone would give me a call when the device was ready to be picked up/bought. Fast forward to March 28, I still had not receive a call from anyone at the Samsung Experience Store. I made multiple calls the previous day and the day of March 28 to check on my pre-order but the line was constantly busy and I never got in contact with anyone there by phone. There was seriously no other way to get in contact with a representative who could check on my pre-order unless I made a visit. It was extremely frustrating as I know they have a lot of samsung representatives at the actual store who do nothing but stand around.I made another visit to this store, (which is the only store of its kind in Ontario). I asked a representative about the status of my pre-order and all he could tell me was that they had only received 12 devices in the silver or gold and that they are expecting another shipment ""hopefully"" by the end of the week. What in the actual fuck? How the hell are they only receiving only 12 devices when both silver and gold are exclusive to the Samsung Experience Store? What was the point of placing a preorder when it is not fulfilled for the release date. The conversation ended with him assuring me that they will give me a call when my device is ready. Just wonderful. Now it has already been another week of waiting (it is now beginning of April), and the 120$ discount promo has expired, and still no call from the Samsung Experience Store on the status of my preorder, and I can't get in contact with anyone at the store by phone, it's literally busy 24/7. Let me guess, only 20 devices were shipped to their flagship store this time? Bunch of bull. They don't have it altogether like the apple store...The way they handle major model releases is so goddamn incompetent.",0
Worst hotel stay ever!  Went here just st from r the adventure dome for my kids.  Only to find out it's only one en Thursday thru Sunday. We checked in Sunday night. My kids were so disappointed. We walked upstairs and were bombarded eveytine we walked up there by people trying to sell us a timeshare.  No coffee maker in rooms. Really ones are smelly and dirty. Food at the deli was horrible. Went there first r breakfast and found a thick black hair in my food. They didn't refund me or even apologies for that matter. The ship s close early and in en late!  Worst headache tel stay ever. I will not be back,0
"Went to this location today, went to their drive thru and the speaker was blown out so I couldn't hear anything they were saying back to me. The soda wasn't full to the top, and my grilled chicken tacos wrapper had black stuff smeared on it, & one of the three tacos had hairs in them. Food was cold. This place is just an all around mess. Needs some new renovations including the employees. I would highly not recommended this location to anyone.",0
"This place was a nightmare, mainly because of the reception ladies. I went in for a consultation about getting my wisdom teeth extracted. I'm already really scared of doing this so I wanted to find a place that I was comfortable in. I was running late and showed up 10 mins late. When I checked in with the ladies at the front desk, they said they had crossed my name of the list and marked me as a no call- no show. I said I was sorry and asked if I could still have my appointment, and they just continued to yell at me for being late. At this point I was appalled at the way she was treating me and wanted to leave right away, I decided not to since I was already there. I said sorry again and the lady finally said they could squeeze me in but I would have to wait 20 mins. I agreed and sat down. The office wasn't even busy. There was one other person sitting in the lobby. They ended up making me wait an hour and a half. I then got up and patiently asked how much longer and then another lady behind the desk started yelling at me telling me it was my fault cus I was late. At this point I should have left but I stayed cus I had already been waiting for so long. I waited. During this time I saw 3 other customers fighting with the ladies as well. They finally got me in with the doctor. He spoke to me for 10 minutes and that was it. I spent 3 hours there for a 10 minute conversations. The ladies at the front desk are nasty and mean. Definitely not getting my wisdom teeth extracted here. Thanks for wasting my time.",0
"This is one seriously boring show.  I do not know what show the other people that give this a great review are watching.  I fought the entire time to stay awake.  Even my GF couldn't take it anymore and we left before the show was over.If you are expecting some daredevil acrobatics and daredevil human tricks, you won't get it here.  At least not until the very end when they do the human hamster wheel.  But, by that time, even the human hamster wheel can't save you from total boredom.There is simply too much  modern dancing, storytelling, and nothing to keep you entertained.  The moving stage is amazing, but that does not make for a good show.  The storyline is impossible to follow.  If you don't believe me, go to wikipedia, read the storyline and then imagine if you could possibly get that from watching a show where nobody is talking.  WTF?This show sucked.  Simple as that.",0
This was one of the worst business experiences of my life.  The owner pushed for more money up front then raised his prices in the middle of a repair job.  He extorted money from my insurance company and does not keep his word. Finally pulled my unfinished car out of his shop and took it somewhere more reputable.  It was worth the out of pocket expense to not do business with him anymore.  If you must do business with him make sure everything is in writing. HE WILL NOT KEEP HIS WORD! There are FAR better places in Vegas to do business.,0
"I tried to make a reservation but no one picked up the phone. They say they open at 4 pm on Saturday and Sundays, so we hoped to get a table by showing up at 4 pm but only the bar is open. The restaurant opens at 5 pm. We were going to have drinks and appetizers at the bar until 5 pm. The manager tells us they are booked and don't have any openings in the dining room until 9:30 pm. We left very disappointed.",0
"DO NOT GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR MONEY!!!! I would have given them 0 stars if I could. The front desk was rude and had attitude, management was rude and had attitude. I honestly felt like I was speaking to my teenage girls. Every time I would try to speak, the girl would cut me off mid sentence and speak to me in a louder voice, finally she got her manager and she wasn't any nicer. We tried to cancel our reservation 2 weeks in advance and they would not give us our refund. They stated they needed proof that we couldn't be there! I'm not calling my kids out of school or calling off work....really you would like a drs note? So so so ridiculous. There are plenty of other places around that deserve your business!!!",0
"BEWARE WHEN USING A DEBIT/CREDIT CARD THEY COMMIT FRAUD IF U LEAVE THE TIP LINE BLANK !!  I had been coming here since June 2017 & I loved the way they did my nails every single  time so Its even more disappointing that I will NEVER be coming back again! I thought I finally found a place that I loved since I moved to this side of town, but last Friday, 3/16/18, I went in to get a fill & cut down & French. The total came to 25.00 + (.50 charge they charge to use a card) = 25.50. The elderly Asian woman that sits all the way in the back was the one who did my nails that day. She was in a bad mood because the salon was getting busy and her son ( tall guy that does pedicures all day) was nowhere to be found. She was calling him and leaving him voicemails and yelling across the salon to the other employees in their language. I asked her if everything was ok & she said my son doesn't answer and look at the salon were busy! I told her she needed to calm down because she still had clients she needed to take care of and shouldn't be yelling that way. When he finally appeared, she yelled at him like a mother yelling at a 5 year old boy. You could tell he got upset/embarrased at the way this woman was yelling at him. Because of her unprofessionalism, I decided NOT to leave her a tip. So I didn't write anything on the tip line, but on the TOTAL LINE, I wrote 25.50 and signed. Well, come to find out when checking my bank statement today, I had a 30.50 charge from this place. I knew for a fact I purposely did not leave this woman a tip due to her unprofessionalism!! So I went to the salon today to ask about this. I spoke to the guy that sits in the first seat ( not sure if this is that woman's son also). He said he would go get the receipt and I said, perfect, I would like to see it also! When he showed it to me I was in complete shock!!! Someone had wrote a number 5 ON THE TIP LINE! MY 25.50 WAS STILL THERE ON THE ""TOTAL"" LINE WHICH MAKES EVEN LESS SENSE ON HOW THEY FELT IT WAS OK TO CHARGE MY CARD 30.50! I got no apology from this guy at all!! He gave me 5.00 cash and said no one there would ever do something like that because they have been in business for so long and he doesn't understand why I am so bitter about it! He blamed me for not specifying the 0 on the tip line!!! EXCUSE ME!! YOUR BUSINESS  or THAT GROUCHY OLD WOMAN STOLE FROM ME!! THIS IS CALLED FRAUD & I WILL BE GETTING A HOLD OF THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU! I should notttt have to put a 0 on the tip line if I specifically put down a TOTAL! No one should WRITE IN THEIR OWN TIP!! SHE IS OBVIOUSLY MONEY HUNGRY AND THATS WHY SHE WAS UPSET HER SON WASNT THERE TO SCAM MORE CUSTOMERS!! CHECK YOUR BANK STATEMENTS AND MAKE SURE THIS BUSINESS DIDNT STEAL FROM YOU TOO!",0
"If you are a healthcare professional I think you will be highly frustrated by this physician. Wish I had read Yelp 1 star reviews before booking my appt. Similar pattern to what others have experienced. Excessive testing that is hinted to in the fine print of her office agreement. She can bill for whatever she wants. That includes urinalysis when you did not give a urine sample, and the prolonged service code which indicates 30 minutes (99354) beyond the typical main code (99205) which has a time of 60 min. For the layperson, that means face to face physician time for 99205 is 60 min, and to use 99354 there must be face to face time of 90+min. I was in and out in under and hour. But the coding does make her another hundred or so. Patients need to note that billing statement does not reflect all she bills to your insurance company, only what you owe. So if you do not call the insurance company or look closely at EOBs, you will not notice what she is billing for and being paid for!! My visit is currently under audit. Yes, she can always chalk it up to a mistake, but multiple coding errors in just one episode of care?? Physician's like this is why we are in the current healthcare situation in the US.Alexandria J below & others from 2017 need to call their insurance company to see if their visit was coded to max this physician's pocket.  Cigna is standing by me and others may find some 'mistakes' over coding.  Besides the over coding, she billed me for the wellness physical and because I stopped her at excessive testing, she refused to sign my form. She is that mean spirited!!!  She then codes me for the office visit and then that 'prolonged service code'....so yes, I too have a few hundred $ bill for something that was to be no cost to benefit us. But worst, her not signing my form cost me money with the employer's incentive program. She accepted payment for the wellness physical and labs....so I can't go for another free wellness physical for another year. She has the money....and out of spite will not sign my form. The form has weight, BP, cholesterol and glucose results. It does not ask her an opinion, just a report out of what she took and was paid for. Cigna did a 3 way call with me and Dr. G on a recorded line. She did not budge and it was quite a recording, note that she is a Cigna preferred provider so under a contract with them.  Other patients need to check what their insurance companies paid for vs. what this doc actually delivered in the office. Notify your insurance company if there are discrepancies.",0
"Awful service. My company used Aires international relocation service and the whole process was a nightmare. The agent assigned to my process was not responsive at all. Delivery of my household took 3 more months than expected.While she originally said, I could call any time if I have questions, she would not reply or communicate at all. She would schedule a meeting and never call or say a word. After, I would send her an email and she would say she was in another meeting. No apologies that couldn't make it, no replies to my questions, nothing.She would send an email saying she needed additional documentation to continue process; but since it was unclear, I would question what exactly was she requesting. I knew the longer it took to provide that data, the longer would take for things to be shipped. She would not answer for days and got upset that I tried to reach out someone else at company to clarify the request and forbide me to call at all, I could only schedule a meeting with her. I am finally done after 6 months.I used Aires relocation services back in 2013 and have an excellent support. Even if things were not going as expected, I would be informed and support was provided as needed.Looks like the service got worse over the years. I would NOT recommend them at all.",0

"Please, please, please do not ever rent a car from this company!!!  My husband and I reserved a midsize SUV through Hotwire.  Upon our arrival at the airport in West Palm Beach, we were told they were low on all cars and would have to wait until one became available.  There was another couple also waiting for a car.  After 35 minutes we were told they were giving us a Mercedes SUV since it was the only car that was just returned.  Although they did not charge us any additional money, an employee drove the car up, left it running and walked away.  No one from SIXT even checked the car out with us for any visible damage.   Before entering the car, I took a picture because my son asked me to send it to him.  THANK GOD I DID!!!  Little did we realize that there was a bubble on the outside of the drivers side tire.  When we arrived at my brother's house 40 minutes later, he spotted the bubble and we immediately called the rental location who gave me the number of the main office.  I explained the situation to the women on the phone who not only apologized but told me that the tires on the Mercedes were known to bubble up, especially in Florida.   She went on to tell me that she actually bought a Mercedes SUV and actually had all her tires replaced immediately.  She then informed me she was sending out another SUV and picking up the Mercedes and that it would be there within the hour.  What was actually delivered was a MINIVAN!!!  I called the women back and she apologized again and said she was sending someone to pick up the minivan and deliver a SUV.  IT ARRIVED 2 HOURS LATER!  When I questioned the driver he said he came all the way from Fort Lauderdale!  I called the office AGAIN and spoke to the same women who went on to tell me that they AGAIN made a mistake and that the driver should not have delivered the SUV and that she specifically asked the West Palm location to deliver a SUV.  Regardless, the women was nice and said because of the inconveniences we had to go through, she was giving us vouchers towards our next rental and that they would be waiting at the desk when we returned the car to West Palm. Additionally, the women sent us more vouchers in the mail.  So now, a couple of months later, I get an email requesting payment for the tire and 2 towing charges!!!  The towing charges being for the delivery of the minivan and finally the SUV.  This company is totally out of control.  So instead of emailing them back, I actually called and spoke to a man in the claims department.  He said he was pulling my file and would document everything we discussed.   Of course that was not the end.  I received another FINAL email requesting payment.  At this point, my husband calls and speaks to another claims representative who says that he will get back to him.  Instead, I now receive a phone call from a collection agency requesting payment ON BEHALF OF SIXT!!!  I again explain the situation, informing them that not only do I have a picture of the tire, but I have 3 witnesses to all conversations held with the SIXT office that day because luckily I had the woman on SPEAKERPHONE!!!  Plus, wouldn't one think that the tire should have been covered under the manufacturer's warrantee since the Mercedes was new?  I have rented many cars over the past 35 years and have NEVER EVER DEALT WITH A COMPANY AS SHADY AS SIXT!  So please be aware, rent from Hertz, Budget, Alamo, Enterprise, Dollar, just anyone but SIXT!  Trust me, you will be so happy you did.",0
"I wouldn't rate this place what so ever if given the choice. My husband and I decided to try their indoor car wash. We started with a water rinse, which took two minutes. When we switched over to the soap there wasn't any! It was empty! So, obviously we decided screw this and we wanted to leave. They refused to let us leave! My husband got out of the car and went to talk to the people inside the gas station. We only used the water and they were demanding $15 for the use of water... obviously my husband refused to pay that. Meanwhile I'm in the car which is being held hostage inside a smelly enclosed garage... did I mention it SMELLED!? Like serious sewage seeping from the drains. At the end of my husbands dispute with the manager he gave them $2... yes $2... because that is what it was ""worth"" . All in all I recommend you go anywhere but here. The wash is broken or empty and the customer service is atrocious.",0
"It is absolutley unacceptable to say an order will be delivered at a certain time and then not even have the courtesy to call and say it will be late.   And the solution the manager offered..."" well maybe next time you order we can do something for you"" what a load of crap.   Plus the pizza was super greasy.  Def not ordering again .",0
"I walked in at 3 o'clock on a Wednesday there were zero people waiting anywhere.I need to open a business account.I overheard the teller speaking to someone in one of the little cubicles.

"Worst service on a warranty I have ever had, anywhere.  My first Tilley Air Flo hat in dark blue was not the right material (Tilley admitted that) and when it faded I sent it in for replacement under warranty.  Tilley refused and then marked ""void"" across the warranty printed by Tilley right in the hat itself.  I will never buy another Tilley hat again.  Way overpriced but I thought (wrong) that the warranty made it worth the gamble.",0
Poor food quality. The pepperoni on the pizza was burnt. Very bad mannered arab at the front counter. Also talking down to his poor employees. They should pick up their overall service if they want to remain competitive. Not worth it with so many other pizza places in sq. Hill.,0
"Food was only average. Karaoke was ridiculous. If you want to sing here don't plan on it. Three hour my husband and my friend husband waited to singing there were people that sang 5 and six times before they sang at all.someone need to teach them how-to run karaoke. the waitress was in such a hurry to  give us our bill she didn't bother to ask  if we need as anything else  before giving us our check. I would of continued to have my margaritas while I was,waiting for them to sing, but if they weren't in hurry to serve me anything wasn't in a,hurry to continue to spend my money there.",0
"I've read all the reviews and I'm so glad I did. The company has been calling and calling. Finally my S.O. agreed to getting a window consultation ONLY. Well.. I'm out doing my yard and this guy drivers up, and I'm already saying NOPE. He smelled like cigarettes, last night alcohol, and no socks on. He started off saying ""There is no way in hell he would be doing this type of yard work"", and just kept talking about himself. He told us how he has multiple credit cards with 80k-100k on his limits, and how he pays his car off in 9 months. I mean on and on. I told him I'm working from home so we needed to get to the point. He measured the windows and said it would be $17249.80 @$249 for 72 months. I said no that's $25k. He however said giving him a yes right now he would drop the price $5k. Just a bunch of BS. We hinted 5 times we were busy, until I said that I'm sorry, but you came at a bad time. I hope this is helpful, and this company gets better people to represent. Yes, you may BLOW Anderson's out of the water, but I can reassure they have their guys nicely dressed, professional, and make it about the customer and not themselves. NO THANKS!",0
"10/18/2015 - 1:27 am.Got a Bacon Slamburger and egg was totally cook.  It seems that they warming up the burger in the Microwave.   Bread was soggy on the bottom bun, and I ask the egg over easy.   Told my restaurant manger my experience and she offer to replace, but I declined.  How would like to trust a cook who can't cook a egg.   Felt bad for the Servers Ashley.  Please address with cook.  Ruin my late night meal experience. P.S.  Didn't help see the cook smoking up front of the restaurant.",0

"For a great cause but will not be returning...I was so excited to go to the Magical Forest for a great holiday experience but was greatly disappointed.  Too many people crammed into one space, lack of organization, and a forced Christmas spirit with glorified advertisements as decorations (who wants a picture with that?).The 'magical forest' walk through was way too crowded, they need to take control of the crowd to handle the volume of people. They should only let a certain number of people in 'the forest' at a time with timed space between each group, as it  would avoid the congestion and claustrophobia.  I realize people want to take pictures and let their kids wander, but it's very hard to do when you have 50 people behind you breathing down your neck,  it felt like cattle herding.  I will be looking somewhere else for my Christmas cheer, as I do not need to experience the feeling of a 'Black Friday crowd' twice in one season, and certainly do not want to be leaving as a Grinch.",0

"The only reason I've continued to go to this office was for Peggy DeCarolis.  She is (or was) completely, undeniably the best part of this office.  Now she's no longer there.  She was probably too nice and thorough and caring for this office.  They won't give you any info on where she went either which is kind of weird.  The few times I did actually see Dr. Wilson I had to wait about an hour.  And the appointment took about 10 mins each time.  She did not act like she gave a rat's ass about me or my problems.  One time for a consult she basically told me to do what I wanted to do...the whole reason for the consult was to get her obviously-more-educated-than-I-in-gynecology-department opinion.  Ugh.  Whatev.Now I have to find a new gynecologist.  Peggy where are you?!??!!",0
"I truly do not understand how this place can have any *Four Star  reviews.Upon my visit (not greeted) not that it matters but I would have guessed the girl at the cashier who was perfectly able to see us walk in would offer a friendly hello. On several occasions where my boyfriend and I asked her questions she would respond very little and very sarcastic. We almost left if it wasn't for the guys working at the  flavor dispenser who kindly offered us some samples and answered our questions.Would I come here again? No. Lowest price cup is $15 and its very simply printed with different colors and a zebra. The drinks are very tasty but very non-alcoholic even if there is alcohol in it.They also charge more for a tube shot of patron or tequia.I would recommend trying Fat Tuesday. Or heading over to Old DownTown Las Vegas for the bar called ""The D""",0
"Although my husband is a big fan of Johnny Rockets, he was entirely disappointed by this joint. Our waitress was nice but didn't seem to care about her job. When my husband ordered what he thought was ""ultimate fries"" (loaded fries with cheese and bacon), the waitress didn't bother to correct him and instead brought us ""unlimited fries"". When she brought out the wrong order, she also didn't bother to offer to fix the mistake. As for the food...my patty melt and my husband's philly cheese steak were both greasy, small portions. If I wanted to lick my lips clean of grease after every bite, I would've ordered a stick of butter. This place has only earned 1-star because of its 5-star milkshake... But how can anyone screw up a milkshake?",0
"This place is over priced and the employees are rude! I had purchased a pair of pants that I had to bring back for an exchange.

The employee was sarcastic and spoke to me in a way that was uncalled for! DO NOT SHOP HERE!!",0
"My family went out of our way to find a KFC. That was a mistake. Our 20 piece wings were rubbery. It seemed like they were a couple hours old. The famous bowl was mediocre at best. The only thing that was edible were the potato wedges and they were cold also. One positive thing was that they were quick, but that's probably because our food was sitting around.",0

"AVOID this company.-Showed up an hour later than the time frame they gave me.-Drivers drove 10-25mph under the speed limit (presumably to get overtime charges).-Drivers appeared to be ungodly high when they got out of the truck to deliver contents to my destination.-Even with their ultra slow driving, the drivers had 30 minutes to make a 15 minute drive to their HQ, and somehow I was charged a $44.50 &quot;Extra Time&quot; fee.The only way I could have been more disappointed is if they ruined my belongings in route, which I was fortunate did not happen.",0
"My boyfriend and I went there for the Chef à l'Érable (an urban sugar shack). The food was not particularly bad but it was definitely not worth ~$85 cad per person. All the dishes were pretty common and there's nothing special about the tastes. I understand it's a sugar shack, so the idea is to share food with friends or family. But this was called ""an urban sugar shack"". At least it should be explicitly mentioned on the website that you will be sharing each dish with strangers if you come as a couple or with a small group! We sat uncomfortably at a small table and had to share each dish with other 3 strangers. The entire dinner ended up like ""excuse me, do you need more potatoes? Can I have the last piece of the ribs?"" We were constantly worried about how to share the food evenly and not to appear to be too greedy. The people at the table next to us were also pretty upset and complained about not having enough food for them to share. What made it worse was the extremely long waiting time during courses. The dinner started at 7 pm and the dessert was ""served"" AFTER 10 pm! The servers were unprofessional. You can hear them dropping spoons/plates during the awkward waiting time for the next dish.The coffee/tea and dessert were not served at the table, which is shocking considering the price of this dinner. They made the ""dessert serving"" as a show by putting them on a long table at the center of the venue. Here's the thing- we have around 250 people there. How is it possible for everyone to get some dessert without pushing each other? It might not have been that much of an issue if they had taken out more when the dessert was running out, but that wasn't the case! I stood up 10-15 mins after the end of the ""dessert show"", and got only scattered blueberries and one or two puffs. The entire night was extremely unpleasant.",0
"Ugh, Lonnies. You have so much potential, but need to get some new employees. I don't know why I keep going back, I leave feeling like an idiot every time. The staff (minus one, who's name I don't know) is so unwilling to help, rude, and belittling. So if you're an expert (to their standards, I suppose) and know exactly what you're looking for this is probably your place. If you're looking for a little direction, have questions, and are hoping to get a kind person on the other side of the counter this isn't your place.",0
"I wish I could post a review for the food, but sadly I never got a chance to try it. Several months ago, my fiance and I decided to have our rehearsal dinner here. We spoke with the manager and were told to simply call two weeks before the date, as the restaurant would not be busy. When we called at the agreed upon time, we were surprised/shocked to discover through the outgoing voicemail that the restaurant was closed for the summer. As instructed by the voicemail, we left a message but never received a return call. We were never given any indication that the restaurant would close for the summer. Luckily, Pinnacle Peak Patio was available and more than happy to accommodate our rehearsal dinner.",0
This place has changed. The prices went up and the portions went down. I have actually seen a manager tell an employee to not use a full scoop of meat. They take advantage of college students by doing this. I will not be going back to this location. The one next to my house doesn't skimp like this place does.,0
"The food was very good. Our server Eric,  however, left something to be desired. The service was very slow. I assumed it was just because it was lunch time. No big deal but it took him about 15 min to come take our order. Again not a huge deal. But then it took at about a good 45-60 minutes for our food to arrive. It took us 15-20 minutes to eat. Not once during the hour or more that we were sitting there did our waiter come and check in on us. He didn't come to give us an update on our food nor did he come to see if we needed anything after our food was delivered. When he came and asked the table next to us if they wanted dessert before they had even gotten their food, we were done. We confronted him about why he hadn't checked on us but offered the table next to us dessert. Hate to bring race into this but the table next to us was white, we are not. He said of course it wasn't because of our race and kind of stumbled over his words. He came back to collect the check that we requested and offered to pay for our meal and that he felt terrible and didn't want us to leave mad. We declined his offer and paid our $85 bill for two drinks and two burgers and left.",0
"This is probably one of Club Monaco's locations that I dislike the most. The workers have so much attitude. I cannot deny the quality of the clothing, but I do find it a bit overpriced at times.

"Came this morning to get a quick car wash before work. I disconnected my phone charger and ipod nano for easier cleaning and put everything in my clean and empty trunk. Once they were finished cleaning my car, I noticed that my ipod nano was missing. I tried talking to the manager but she was ""too busy"" in a meeting to come out and help out with the situation. She just told the supervisor to tell me that they're not ""responsible for belongings inside the car"" even though I had JUST disconnected it for them to clean the inside of my car. Nobody seems to have it of course, so even though it's a minor thing, I called the local police to see if we can find the person responsible for that. HORRIBLE customer service. It's the LAST time I'll ever be back here. I don't recommend it to anybody. Very dishonest staff.",0
I should give them  no star at all ! I never ever met so dishonest people like these guys ! I sent my wife with her 15 years old car for a simple oil change .

When i went back with her they said everything they did she signed and agreed to . But she had no clue what shes signing and how much is gonna be  and why she need those services .

"Had a custom home built in New River Arizona while I was living in California (unable to supervise day to day) Spent $24,000 with this crook for a well that was requested to be 500' deep. He was onsite for 2 months, drilled the well smack in the middle of our drainage (according to plans) path and left without permission after saying he dug to 400' and billing accordingly, (it's been measured at only 310' since then). He cut the well pipe off underground and buried it in a sprinkler box and said it was ""driveable"". Frazee used 3 different size well casings because he doesn't know what he's doing and the smallest size casing is 4.5"" at the bottom of the well which won't even accommodate my pump because it's too skinny, effectively rendering that depth up useable. The well cap was never sealed because Frazee cut the well casing and left a huge metal burr so the seal could never be made watertight with the gasket, causing rain runoff to enter my well every time it rains. My water literally turns brown when we have a heavy rain. I have a 2 year old daughter and o ran a well water test to see if she'd be in any danger because she's always splashing water into her mouth at her little pool and in the shower. The test showed I do have harmful bacteria. We have been living in this home drinking bottled water hoping for the best (as we can't afford a new well or would have already had one drilled) There are so many problems with this well it would take me two pages to explain them all. Bottom line is....Stay the hell away from Frazee Water Well Drilling in New River Arizona, for your own piece of mind and for your families safety.",0

"I went to visit the jewellery store during lunch today from a recommendation from my co-worker. He advised that they had sapphires and that they were unheated.As I entered the store, there was a customer being taken care of a young man. An older man asked if how he could help me, and I advised him that I was looking for unheated sapphires. The man looked offended, and advised that the sapphires are over here and that there isn't such thing as unheated sapphires. He then turned his back on me and yelled out ""what a stupid question"". I was pulled back as I just entered the store and ask him why it was a stupid question, and then he started to yell at me (and I mean yell) and questioned me on who told me there were such thing of unheated sapphires. Startled once again, I quietly said online and he yelled that was no such thing.The young man then stopped talking to the client and he advised me that there was no was no way of identifying it. Nonetheless the older man ignore me afterwards and started to serve another customer again. I quietly left.I told my co-worker about the experience and he was shocked. I seriously don't advise coming here, unless you are a gluten for being degraded. The store is conveniently located and the jewellery is organized. But I would suggest taking your business elsewhere, poorest service I had in years.",0
"It was fun to try the different ciders, although that's not my beverage of choice. Ordered the clam chowder as a starter and was heavily disappointed - super creamy, oily, heavy tasting with a few pieces of clam and chunks of potato. Majorly lacking in any kind of flavour. I ate about 1/4 of the bowl and it was lukewarm by then and was kind of grossing me out. Followed that up with wings, which are normally a safe bet at a pub type place - they were 'meh', also oily tasting, not very hot, and also bland. My friend ordered the chickpea/chana masala dish and said it was 'fine' but again, lacking in spicing and flavour. Feeling is that without a better menu and better tasting food, this will be in/out of the hood pretty fast. Cute inside but so are the other restaurants in the area. Get a new chef!",0

"Food was overpriced and not very good. The ""classicos"" entrees are about $20 a plate. Tacos are ordered in twos and cost about $12 (no mixing and matching). The red snapper ceviche was very oniony and strange tasting.  Would not recommend.I had to send lamb entree back because it was cold in the middle. Yikes. Service took care of it promptly and without question, so that was good.Food needs to be rethought, better prepared, and more competitively priced as there are many superior Mexican food options in the city now.",0
"Horrible place! They were so rude when they had me and a few other women sitting in their massage chair for two hours waiting for a pedicure. Not only that,they had a young girl take my old nails off,even though I suggested letting them soak she continued to rip them off. The pain on my face was visible,yet she continued.. Then she cut the tip of my finger off,so then I couldn't get acrylics because the pain was excruciating,she still tried to put acrylics on after that!! I still had to pay! Worst nail salon experience ever!!",0
"We stopped in today (buy local!) for lunch and wow, how sad a trip was this. The order taker took a phone order in front of us after we had been waiting for several minutes with no one in front of us. (hello, they can hold. I am standing RIGHT here) They were out of the advertised Not Your Father's Root Beer. All of the perimeter tables were dirty. Our burgers arrived cold without cheese, accompanied by cold fries and cold rings. But the worst thing was that the burgers were dry and salty, straight up not good at all. I feel a little ill just thinking about it. I should have said something while we were there, but the cook was SO nice (a terrible cook but hey) and the order taker was SO unfriendly that we just ate what we could and left. I sure hope the help wanted sign is taken advantage of soon to get a better cook and a better order taker. For $35 (including tip) I expected so much more.",0
